For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to avoid complex process diagrams with decision points and flow charts. Instead, the popular double diamond framework provides us with a simple illustration of how an idea best progresses from concept to a real, working product or venture.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tju3cwSB78mjbdus.png\" /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond\">Double Diamond</a> is a process developed by the Design Council of the UK. It combines divergent thinking (exploring an issue widely) and convergent thinking to understand the problem, use these insights to define a solution, develop a solution then deliver a solution (put it into action).</p><p>Most organisations use some variation of this to work ideas from a few lines on a piece of paper to something being used by customers and earning revenue (or results).</p><p>Most of the time a new idea will need multiple iterations around this loop. For various reasons, many organisations can struggle with iterations (e.g. fear of failure, budget or governance process).</p><p>When someone is submitting ideas to a product or venture team, they’re coming in at the Discover step. You need to help them understand the problem in order to get to the next step. Most people unfamiliar with these techniques jump straight to develop mode (“I already know what we need to do, can you just build it?”).</p><h3>Why Start with Discovery?</h3><p>You need to start with a Discovery because this is <em>the</em> process for understanding the problem and the customer. It’s a way of explicitly stating your assumptions. This is the foundation that any successful venture, product or idea is built on.</p><p>If you find yourself saying “ <a href=\"https://terem.tech/when-knowing-your-customers-best-isnt-beneficial/\">I understand the customer</a> “, “I already understand the problem” or “I already know what we need” then, I can tell you now you are wrong. This comes from hard-won, expensive experience that I’ve learnt too often. The people and companies with the best understanding of their customer always say they don’t understand their customers enough, those that lack it always says they know what their customers need.</p><p>You can find a more detailed explanation of <a href=\"https://terem.tech/why-do-product-discovery/\">why Discovery is the essential foundation for any product or venture here</a>. Including a list of the benefits, risks for skipping it and false reasons people give for why it isn’t needed.</p><h3>Why Focus on The Customer and Their Problem First?</h3><p>The reason why you focus on the customer (or citizen!) and their problem first is because, at the end of the day, this is where a product succeeds or fails. You need to solve a problem.</p><p>As a non-product person, helping your product or venture team understand the customer problem is where you can add an immense amount of value, especially because you are probably closer to the customer than they are.</p><p>The focus on this, really getting this right, is far more important in the early stages of the process than market size, solutions and, even business models. If you understand the problem well, everything else can fall into place and be designed around it. If you get it wrong, then you’ll forever be trying to make up for it, often in an unnecessarily expensive way.</p><h3>What to Expect From Discovery</h3><p>When you are doing a discovery, you will likely start with the idea that you think is amazing. Then you’ll begin to explicitly stating your assumptions and interviewing customers. You are going to start learning things about the problem, about your assumptions and your customers that you had not considered.</p><p>If you’re doing it right, you will almost certainly change direction. You’ll either completely change your thinking, or you’ll make adjustments.</p><p>Follow the problem and your research, not your biases and initial assumptions.</p><p>You’ll come to the end of your discovery activities and be faced with <a href=\"https://terem.tech/end-of-discovery-decisions-what-to-do-next/\">an end of Discovery decision</a>. You’ll need to consider this before you go ahead and take it to the group that decides whether to proceed or not (it’s usually some kind of committee or executive group, but in smaller companies, it might be an individual).</p><h3>Key Concepts to Know</h3><p>There are a few concepts to consider when working through a Discovery. The list below is a refined list selected for non-product people working through the process of getting their idea up.</p><ol><li><strong>Recognise the realities of large companies</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>New ideas carry high uncertainty that large companies aren’t used to. Be aware of this and how to deal with it, don’t get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to provide certainty where it isn’t possible.</li><li>There are corporate forces that work against new products and ventures. Be aware of them, address them head-on.</li><li>Corporations get distracted by market size. It’s not always the right way to think early on with an idea.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Understand how product development is approached beyond discovery</strong> — start with the <a href=\"https://terem.tech/principles-of-product/\">principles of a product-led approach</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Focus on customers at the start of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle</strong>: Early on, you want and need to focus on customers that will be innovators. The ones that will be ok with early versions of your product, early versions that have less features because they feel the pain strongly and are willing to take some risk. Only once you are succeeding with them will you consider expanding the product to meet the needs of later adopters.</p><h3>How a Decision to Proceed Will be Made</h3><p>Finally, you want to have some understanding of how a decision will be made about whether your idea proceeds to whatever the next step in your organisation’s process is.</p><p>Most companies will have a framework or some criteria. Get this ahead of time.</p><p>Then make sure your pitch for proceeding focuses on why it’s worth proceeding to the next stage rather than why you need to Go-to-Market now. It’s easy to get diverted by solutions, market sizing and trends, but it’s usually so early in the evolution of the idea that the idea is easily rejected because it carries too many assumptions or risks.</p><p>Instead, focus on what you have with your newly gained understanding of the customer and the problem. Pitch to address the assumptions you have and outline possible solutions to the problem.</p><p>When it comes to the pitch itself, after we’ve debated the idea, I personally find it beneficial to focus everyone <a href=\"https://terem.tech/4-questions-product-venture-executives-must-focus-on/\">on four key questions</a>:</p><ol><li>Do we want to be in this space?</li><li>Is this a <em>good enough</em> idea in the space?</li><li>What’s the <em>single biggest</em> assumption we need to address?</li><li>Does this proposed next step address this assumption?</li></ol><h3>Discovery Tools for Non-product People</h3><p>The key tools that a non-product person needs to run a <em>good enough</em> Discovery are:</p><ol><li>Customer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas</li><li>Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)</li><li>Business Model Canvas</li></ol><p>Other tools like wireframing or prototyping tools were considered but have explicitly been omitted. These tools send people inexperienced with discovery too far down the solution path and become distractions from them focusing on the problem and the customer.</p><p>Tools for market sizing and complex financial analysis have also been explicitly omitted. These activities distract from focusing on real customer problems.</p><p>The tools that have been listed really focus the mind on the customer, the customer’s problem, the commercial opportunity and the viability of that opportunity. In the early stages, rough answers and hypotheses are acceptable: perfect is the enemy of done and progress.</p><p>Below is a brief overview of each tool.</p><h4><a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas\">Customer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas</a></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/598/0*2o-07jgufO2sSDVy.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.b2binternational.com/research/methods/faq/what-is-the-value-proposition-canvas/\">B2B International</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Jobs-to-be-Done</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s4YBlRcjs0dnriTL.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb\">Jobs-to-be-Done.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Learn <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-master-your-customers-needs-using-jtbd/\">how to master Jobs-to-be-Done to understand your customer in this article</a>.</p><h4>Business Model Canvas</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rM1m1garVzSRV2Si.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas\">Strategyzer</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Discovery Skills for Non-product People</h3><p>Now that people are armed with the background knowledge, you can work through the foundational skills and tools for doing a discovery:</p><ol><li>How to run early customer interviews:<br>- <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-run-early-customer-interviews/\">A step-by-step guide</a><br>- <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-conduct-excellent-customer-interviews/\">A video on running the interviews themselves</a></li><li><a href=\"https://terem.tech/blog/validate-new-products-features-landing-page-experiments/\">How to use landing page experiments to quickly understand customer behaviour</a></li><li><a href=\"https://terem.tech/6-steps-to-validate-jtbd-with-surveys/\">Surveys to validate Jobs-to-be-Done</a></li></ol><h3>Closing Thoughts &amp; Clarifications</h3><p>There is a lot of knowledge, skills and tools that have been explicitly avoided, anything to do with solutions, market sizing and financials.

There are some solid articles on this already, as well as great guidance from the recent <a href=\"https://www.crackingthepmcareer.com/\"><em>Cracking the PM Career </em></a>book. But I still feel like there isn’t enough information out there on how to make this leap. It pains me to watch amazing PMs become jaded or even toxic as they find that they can’t seem to break into the next level.</p><p>So I wanted to break down my understanding of the kinds of outcomes and behaviors necessary in moving from IC to people manager. In this series, I’ll be sharing my own experiences in struggling with understanding and demonstrating these outcomes and building these skills.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*EKscy_jnSe7VQIrq5AOQnw.png\" /></figure><h3>A Big Leap</h3><p>The hardest gap to cross in the Product Management career (other than breaking into PM at all) is moving from individual contributor to people manager and Product Leader.</p><p>Others have expressed this quite well, but it’s worth reiterating: <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/crossing-the-canyon-product-manager-to-product-leader\"><strong>what got you here won’t get you there</strong></a>.</p><p>As an individual contributor Product Manager, you can spend years honing your craft and focusing on doing your job better. You’ll see steady increases in scope and salary, moving from a junior PM, to mid-level, to Senior.</p><p>But at a certain point, all your hard work stops resulting in forward progress. You hit a point where you keep improving your skills, but you get passed over when that Group role that opens up. Or you max out on your capacity to drive initiatives, and you aren’t getting recognized for doing all the hard work. You get vague feedback on why you didn’t get the promotion, or unclear guidance on what you can do to position yourself for the next one. It seems like nothing you’re doing matters in making the leap to a Product Leader role (Lead Product Manager, Group Product Manager, Director, etc.).</p><p>Quite likely, you’re going about it wrong.</p><p>Just like breaking into Product Management, moving from an individual contributor PM into a managing PM is a role change. There are different responsibilities, different outcomes, different skills. Understanding this distinction is critical to successfully making the transition.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*03yjoV9CFSVTwoP2oEIPxA.png\" /></figure><h3>Product Leader vs. Product Manager</h3><p>Every good Product Manager is a leader. They lead their teams, building excitement on a product vision, roadmap, and features. They lead key projects and initiatives, driving collaboration across a myriad of stakeholders. They lead meetings, brainstorming sessions, customer research calls, and a multitude of interactions.</p><p>But being a Product Leader means more than being a great Product Manager. PMs tend to operate within a limited scope of responsibility, limited to one or two teams. And PMs tend to be the primary driver for those teams.</p><p>Being a Product Leader is about inspiring and leading other PMs and leaders in the org and across the company, far beyond the outcomes of a single team. It’s about stepping away from being the individual driver, and guiding others to drive big parts of an even bigger problem.</p><p>Additionally, managing other PMs is a unique challenge, and one that PMs might think they’ve experienced as a result of having led teams. The reality is that great hiring and recruiting is time consuming and challenging. Coaching and mentoring other PMs is not as simple as knowing the answer and making sure they do it. Fostering growth in your team and creating a positive team culture requires thought and intention.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*QRmC9htM0gGaXgNMeaQjfA.png\" /></figure><h3>It’s All About Trust</h3><p>Most great Product Managers could do a good job — even a great job — as a Product Leader. Eventually. If they got the opportunity, they could practice, get coaching, read books, do the work, and eventually become great. But getting that opportunity is where the challenge lies for a lot of PMs. Senior leaders don’t want to risk the harm a premature promotion can cause.</p><p>Having the potential to do the work is not the same as having done the work. Having the ability to shift mindset and focus is not the same as having already made that change.</p><p>You need to build trust with your manager, their manager, their peers, and with senior leadership that you can do the work and you can do it well.</p><p>So, what does this all look like?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*niiuFNEuNp-Ol20Ia_CrvA.png\" /></figure><h3>What You Do and How You Do It</h3><p>Demonstrating product leadership is about driving major <strong>outcomes and impact</strong> and the <strong>skills and traits</strong> of doing it well.

There are some solid articles on this already, as well as great guidance from the recent Cracking the PM Career book. But I still feel like there isn’t enough information out there on how to make this leap. It pains me to watch amazing PMs become jaded or even toxic as they find that they can’t seem to break into the next level.\nSo I wanted to break down my understanding of the kinds of outcomes and behaviors necessary in moving from IC to people manager. In this series, I’ll be sharing my own experiences in struggling with understanding and demonstrating these outcomes and building these skills.\n\nA Big Leap\nThe hardest gap to cross in the Product Management career (other than breaking into PM at all) is moving from individual contributor to people manager and Product Leader.\nOthers have expressed this quite well, but it’s worth reiterating: what got you here won’t get you there.\nAs an individual contributor Product Manager, you can spend years honing your craft and focusing on doing your job better. You’ll see steady increases in scope and salary, moving from a junior PM, to mid-level, to Senior.\nBut at a certain point, all your hard work stops resulting in forward progress. You hit a point where you keep improving your skills, but you get passed over when that Group role that opens up. Or you max out on your capacity to drive initiatives, and you aren’t getting recognized for doing all the hard work. You get vague feedback on why you didn’t get the promotion, or unclear guidance on what you can do to position yourself for the next one. It seems like nothing you’re doing matters in making the leap to a Product Leader role (Lead Product Manager, Group Product Manager, Director, etc.).\nQuite likely, you’re going about it wrong.\nJust like breaking into Product Management, moving from an individual contributor PM into a managing PM is a role change. There are different responsibilities, different outcomes, different skills. Understanding this distinction is critical to successfully making the transition.\n\nProduct Leader vs. Product Manager\nEvery good Product Manager is a leader. They lead their teams, building excitement on a product vision, roadmap, and features. They lead key projects and initiatives, driving collaboration across a myriad of stakeholders. They lead meetings, brainstorming sessions, customer research calls, and a multitude of interactions.\nBut being a Product Leader means more than being a great Product Manager. PMs tend to operate within a limited scope of responsibility, limited to one or two teams. And PMs tend to be the primary driver for those teams.\nBeing a Product Leader is about inspiring and leading other PMs and leaders in the org and across the company, far beyond the outcomes of a single team. It’s about stepping away from being the individual driver, and guiding others to drive big parts of an even bigger problem.\nAdditionally, managing other PMs is a unique challenge, and one that PMs might think they’ve experienced as a result of having led teams. The reality is that great hiring and recruiting is time consuming and challenging. Coaching and mentoring other PMs is not as simple as knowing the answer and making sure they do it. Fostering growth in your team and creating a positive team culture requires thought and intention.\n\nIt’s All About Trust\nMost great Product Managers could do a good job — even a great job — as a Product Leader. Eventually. If they got the opportunity, they could practice, get coaching, read books, do the work, and eventually become great. But getting that opportunity is where the challenge lies for a lot of PMs. Senior leaders don’t want to risk the harm a premature promotion can cause.\nHaving the potential to do the work is not the same as having done the work. Having the ability to shift mindset and focus is not the same as having already made that change.\nYou need to build trust with your manager, their manager, their peers, and with senior leadership that you can do the work and you can do it well.\nSo, what does this all look like?\n\nWhat You Do and How You Do It\nDemonstrating product leadership is about driving major outcomes and impact and the skills and traits of doing it well. It’s about impact at the organizational and business level, instead of the team level. And how you collaborate, the attitude you display, and the atmosphere you create determine whether other leaders trust you to lead.\nThis is a five part series. In each article, I’ll provide guidance and perspective on what matters and why, and share personal examples on how I made these changes.\nShifting Perspective:\n\nPart 1: Thinking Like a Leader\n\nThe first step of any journey is internal. The biggest obstacle I faced in making the transition from Product Manager to Product Leader was my own mindset and attitude. Shifting this perspective was fundamental to unblocking my progress.\nDriving Impact:\n\nPart 2: Driving Business Outcomes and Impact\nPart 3: Establishing Excellence in Product Management\nPart 4: Growing a Team\n\nThis section covers the kinds of impact you should strive to achieve as a growing Product Leader. It’s about growing the organization and business via taking on larger initiatives, driving improvements in product processes, and leveling up the PM team.\nCollaborative Leadership:\n\nPart 5: Influencing an Organization\n\nCollaborating with other leaders to influence and effect change across an organization is an ever evolving challenge and the cornerstone of great leadership. While individual initiatives may succeed or fail, how you worked with people along the way indicates whether you and your organization will be successful over the long run.\nAbout Me\nI wanted to mention a bit about my background to provide context for these articles.\nI got my start as a Product Manager about eight years ago, in mobile free to play gaming.

Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. Hence, we employ empiricism—based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—in a continuous feedback loop that allows us to defer an investment decision to the last economically feasible moment in time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite all this mitigation effort, any Sprint Goal remains a hypothesis until we release the resulting Increment into the hands of our customers. The release is the moment of truth, and occasional failure is inevitable—even for the best Scrum Teams. Therefore, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>What Happens If There Is no Failure Culture</h2> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. If resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-failure-culture-making-your-scrum-work-10/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Scrum Failure Culture — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture. In a complex environment, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure. In my eyes, failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. By all means, avoid turning failure into your organization’s innovation scarecrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is your organization failing to embrace a Scrum failure culture, thus impeding Scrum?

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. To make things worse, a crucial success factor of every Scrum team is not even mentioned in the Scrum Guide: Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture.\n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of not living a failure culture in less than three minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more than 240 peers from May 27-29, 2021, for the Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021, a live virtual Barcamp using open space technology principles and practices.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Embracing Failure as an Option Is Essential\n\r\n\r\nScrum is about figuring out what is worth building to improve your customers’ lives while mitigating risk in a complex environment. Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. Hence, we employ empiricism—based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—in a continuous feedback loop that allows us to defer an investment decision to the last economically feasible moment in time. \n\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all this mitigation effort, any Sprint Goal remains a hypothesis until we release the resulting Increment into the hands of our customers. The release is the moment of truth, and occasional failure is inevitable—even for the best Scrum Teams. Therefore, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.\n \r\n\r\nWhat Happens If There Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. If resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nScrum Failure Culture — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nAny organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture. In a complex environment, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure. In my eyes, failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. By all means, avoid turning failure into your organization’s innovation scarecrow.\n\r\n\r\nHow is your organization failing to embrace a Scrum failure culture, thus impeding Scrum?

As the citadel of tech-driven small businesses and startups, India has already come to the forefront in turning mobile apps into its footprints. The Mobile <a href=\"https://www.indianappdevelopers.com/\">app development India</a> is now primarily engaged in shaping the mobile presence for small businesses and startups. When focusing on the Indian market, even the global tech giants prioritize the wants and preferences of small and medium enterprises across the niches.</p><p>As per the statistics published by <a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2020-infographic/\">AppAnnie</a>, as of 2019, India stood globally in the 4th position among the countries with the highest concentration of Android users. There can hardly be any doubt that a considerable portion of these Android users and apps belong to small business apps. Other statistics confirm this. According to Cisco, <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/moneyball-ciscos-pankaj-mitra-on-what-startups-bring-to-the-table-for-big-tech/\">30% of the business it gets in India comes from SMEs</a>. Big brands like Google, Microsoft and Amazon continue to focus on the Indian small enterprise market with unperturbed zeal. According to the latest data, more than <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/google-survey-says-close-to-two-thirds-of-smes-in-india-are-undergoing-revenue-loss/articleshow/76733530.cms?from=mdr\">26 million</a> small businesses in India have shaped their online presence by using various Google apps, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, etc.</p><p>What makes small enterprises in India consider mobile apps so crucial for their businesses? Well, the reasons are too many. Mobile apps, apart from allowing exceptional ease of operation, can help a business do growth hacking. From robust mobile branding to delivering customer service, mobile apps play a crucial role for small businesses in some ways.</p><p>Let us have a quick look at some of the key ways mobile apps can benefit small businesses.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*6mTgKnENRXbY-BvWPlb96A.png\" /></figure><h3><strong>Personalized Marketing</strong></h3><p>The vast majority of customers, around 70% of them, consider personalized user experience a key factor in engaging with brands. Smartphones are quintessentially personal devices, and hence mobile apps can play a significant role in personalizing customer communication to a great extent.</p><p>By utilizing a mobile app, even small enterprises across the niches enjoy the opportunity to drive customer engagement and create strong bonds. The Indian small business sector is more evident as mobile apps are helping the so-called brick-and-mortar stores compete with big brands with a personalized experience.</p><p>Small business mobile app development India focuses on certain features, and user experience attributes push this personalization drive. For example, the use of personalized push notifications helps small enterprises connect customers easily with the right message and at the right time.</p><p>The personalized user experience can be augmented by utilizing the users’ data and location data to unleash mobile promotions, roll out new features, and create a better user experience.</p><h3><strong>Lead generation and Business Conversion</strong></h3><p>Lead generation and steady business conversion happen to be the two most important benefits of mobile apps for small businesses. Many small businesses that have limited scope in interacting directly with customers find mobile apps and social media channels as an effective medium to generate business leads.</p><p>Hyperlocal and highly context-aware marketing of services and products through mobile apps can easily push lead generation and increase business conversion. In addition, thanks to the powerful location-sensing technologies used by today’s mobile apps and because of the scope of using data-driven insights, mobile apps can play a great role in engaging customers based on their location and the specific user context.</p><p>A retail business now can easily facilitate omnichannel targeting of customers with the mobile apps playing the central role in coordinating with different channels. For instance, a mobile app for a retail brand can sync the customer experience and buying process between the online store and the physical store.

As the citadel of tech-driven small businesses and startups, India has already come to the forefront in turning mobile apps into its footprints. The Mobile app development India is now primarily engaged in shaping the mobile presence for small businesses and startups. When focusing on the Indian market, even the global tech giants prioritize the wants and preferences of small and medium enterprises across the niches.\nAs per the statistics published by AppAnnie, as of 2019, India stood globally in the 4th position among the countries with the highest concentration of Android users. There can hardly be any doubt that a considerable portion of these Android users and apps belong to small business apps. Other statistics confirm this. According to Cisco, 30% of the business it gets in India comes from SMEs. Big brands like Google, Microsoft and Amazon continue to focus on the Indian small enterprise market with unperturbed zeal. According to the latest data, more than 26 million small businesses in India have shaped their online presence by using various Google apps, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, etc.\nWhat makes small enterprises in India consider mobile apps so crucial for their businesses? Well, the reasons are too many. Mobile apps, apart from allowing exceptional ease of operation, can help a business do growth hacking. From robust mobile branding to delivering customer service, mobile apps play a crucial role for small businesses in some ways.\nLet us have a quick look at some of the key ways mobile apps can benefit small businesses.\n\nPersonalized Marketing\nThe vast majority of customers, around 70% of them, consider personalized user experience a key factor in engaging with brands. Smartphones are quintessentially personal devices, and hence mobile apps can play a significant role in personalizing customer communication to a great extent.\nBy utilizing a mobile app, even small enterprises across the niches enjoy the opportunity to drive customer engagement and create strong bonds. The Indian small business sector is more evident as mobile apps are helping the so-called brick-and-mortar stores compete with big brands with a personalized experience.\nSmall business mobile app development India focuses on certain features, and user experience attributes push this personalization drive. For example, the use of personalized push notifications helps small enterprises connect customers easily with the right message and at the right time.\nThe personalized user experience can be augmented by utilizing the users’ data and location data to unleash mobile promotions, roll out new features, and create a better user experience.\nLead generation and Business Conversion\nLead generation and steady business conversion happen to be the two most important benefits of mobile apps for small businesses. Many small businesses that have limited scope in interacting directly with customers find mobile apps and social media channels as an effective medium to generate business leads.\nHyperlocal and highly context-aware marketing of services and products through mobile apps can easily push lead generation and increase business conversion. In addition, thanks to the powerful location-sensing technologies used by today’s mobile apps and because of the scope of using data-driven insights, mobile apps can play a great role in engaging customers based on their location and the specific user context.\nA retail business now can easily facilitate omnichannel targeting of customers with the mobile apps playing the central role in coordinating with different channels. For instance, a mobile app for a retail brand can sync the customer experience and buying process between the online store and the physical store. You scan a product while window shopping, get informed about the product through the mobile app and make the purchase order from mobile.\nHelping with Operational Ease and Cost-Saving\nMobile apps can get things done in a whizz when communicating with customers, solving their issues and providing customers what they want. Operational efficiency is a key reason for many small businesses to embrace mobile apps.\nCompanies relying heavily on the field staff can benefit tremendously from mobile apps. From monitoring the field staff in real-time to collaborating on service-related issues, mobile apps in more than one way can ensure operational ease in companies depending on field service or field professionals.\nThanks to real-time collaboration and the capability to track employees and tasks through mobile apps, businesses can also make considerable cost savings for operational tasks. Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.\nTaking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps\nWith the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches. So today, you have doorstep food delivery apps, an on-demand app for barbers and beauticians, apps for housemaid services and apps for almost everything that can cater to on-demand needs.\nThe best thing about on-demand apps is that you don’t need to start a completely new business catering to the demands of the customers registered through a mobile app. You can either just turn your good old website or the existing mobile app into an on-demand app to cater to more customers, or you can just register with an aggregator or marketplace app and allow customers to buy your services or products through that app.\nWhen it comes to in-demand apps, the sky’s the limit for a small business to prosper. For example, suppose you are a local grocery shop with a limited clientele. In that case, you can just build your grocery delivery app and offer doorstep delivery services throughout the whole city and even beyond the city limits.\nOn-demand app development in India is on the rise, thanks to the overwhelming number of unique services and solutions these apps are providing. For example, an app offering tattoo and body graffiti artists services in every city area can just be availed by the people and artist professionals alike.\nEnhancing Customer Loyalty\nA mobile app, unlike a website, doesn’t get lost in the clamour and noise of the web. It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often.

Unfortunately, we likely missed quite a few. But these advantages at least portray how small companies and startups can take advantage of a level playing field shared by big brands of their niches.\n\nHow Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India? was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Juned Ghanchi","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d45d1033fc57","categories":["mobile-app-developers","mobile-app-development","app-development","on-demand-app-development","app-development-india"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T10:41:45.000Z"},{"creator":"Tremis Skeete","title":"Three Types of Customers that Use Your Software Product","link":"https://productcoalition.com/three-types-of-customers-that-use-your-software-product-7bf6ed9f83b9?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 05:44:30 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>While there are many different customer types, they are essentially in three categories.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0nJmq7nWd7I0tX7bGuEkxA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Great digital products are not built in a vacuum.

Well-intentioned of course but with an instinctual urge to ask “is that safe?” before proceeding. Perhaps Darwin favors this trait in humans and long ago the majority of my look-before-you-leap ancestors did not fair so well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-coblocks-gif\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/FNtuCSt0pYR9e/giphy.gif?w=638&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ddd2\">But when we had our daughter, I wanted to find a new intermediate point between seeking absolute safety and Wile E. Coyote. Some parenting guides suggest that asking “are you ok?” when a child falls down actually encourages them to feel *not* ok because it increases the alarm or reinforces they’ll get pleasurable soothing if they show distress. [Lest people think that I stared silently at my toddler when she tripped on the sidewalk, I substituted “you are ok!” as an assurance.] And so Adventure Boo-Boos were born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fa0e\">We don’t recall when Adventure Boo-Boos officially debuted as description but it likely coincided with the debut of my daughter’s enthusiasm for climbing very high up on playground equipment or trees. Soon scrapes, bumps, skinned knees and similar were deemed “Adventure Boo-Boos” — to be celebrated not feared. Make good choices and if you still fall, the abrasion was a form of epaulette, recognizing your life experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ff86\">Our family was a few months into Adventure Boo-Boos when we were strolling down Valencia St one weekend afternoon. Passing a streetwear shop our kid paused, noticing the television set up inside which was playing a loop of skateboarding videos. She walked in and placed herself on the couch, evidently attracted to the stunts. I sat down next to her and started explaining what she was seeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a63c\">It was the epic 1999 X Games (coincidentally held in San Francisco) and Tony Hawk performing the sport’s first ever 900. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/900_(skateboarding)\">900</a> refers to a 900 degree airborne spin, 2 1/2 rotations. As shown in the clip below, Tony tried the trick a number of times during the performance, all unsuccessfully, until he finally nailed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class='youtube-player' width='638' height='359' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YYTNkAdDD8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b14e\">Each failure resulted in some degree of bump, bruise, or fall. After a few of these my daughter pointed to him and said “Adventure Boo-Boos?” Yup, Adventure Boo-Boos for sure, I told her and then we watched him end with a victory. She clapped. I smiled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5e35\">Parents live for these organic teachable moments so I considered it a karmic sign when the next day my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidu\">David</a> tweeted about fundraising for the Tony Hawk Foundation. After a quick DM exchange and small charitable donation, a signed skate deck was on its way to my house. We hung it in our breakfast nook, where it remains today.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"9334\" data-permalink=\"https://hunterwalk.com/2021/05/19/how-pro-skateboarder-tony-hawk-made-me-a-better-parent/img_2073/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 12 Pro&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1620569645&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_2073\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?fit=638%2C479&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"638\" height=\"479\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=638%2C479&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9334\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?resize=200%2C150&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?w=1276&amp;ssl=1 1276w, https://i2.wp.com/hunterwalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2073.jpg?w=1914&amp;ssl=1 1914w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption>“Astrid.

[Lest people think that I stared silently at my toddler when she tripped on the sidewalk, I substituted “you are ok!” as an assurance.] And so Adventure Boo-Boos were born.\nWe don’t recall when Adventure Boo-Boos officially debuted as description but it likely coincided with the debut of my daughter’s enthusiasm for climbing very high up on playground equipment or trees. Soon scrapes, bumps, skinned knees and similar were deemed “Adventure Boo-Boos” — to be celebrated not feared. Make good choices and if you still fall, the abrasion was a form of epaulette, recognizing your life experience.\nOur family was a few months into Adventure Boo-Boos when we were strolling down Valencia St one weekend afternoon. Passing a streetwear shop our kid paused, noticing the television set up inside which was playing a loop of skateboarding videos. She walked in and placed herself on the couch, evidently attracted to the stunts. I sat down next to her and started explaining what she was seeing.\nIt was the epic 1999 X Games (coincidentally held in San Francisco) and Tony Hawk performing the sport’s first ever 900. The 900 refers to a 900 degree airborne spin, 2 1/2 rotations. As shown in the clip below, Tony tried the trick a number of times during the performance, all unsuccessfully, until he finally nailed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach failure resulted in some degree of bump, bruise, or fall. After a few of these my daughter pointed to him and said “Adventure Boo-Boos?” Yup, Adventure Boo-Boos for sure, I told her and then we watched him end with a victory. She clapped. I smiled.\nParents live for these organic teachable moments so I considered it a karmic sign when the next day my friend David tweeted about fundraising for the Tony Hawk Foundation. After a quick DM exchange and small charitable donation, a signed skate deck was on its way to my house. We hung it in our breakfast nook, where it remains today.\n“Astrid.

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;</li>\r\n\t<li>Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;</li>\r\n\t<li>Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>Holding each other accountable as professionals.</li>\r\n</ul></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#developers\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team’s Product Owner supports creating a shared understanding among all Scrum team members on the why, the what, and the how. However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>The Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/developers-dont-talk-customers-fallacy-making-your-scrum-wor/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers Code Fallacy — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:\n\r\n\r\n\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCreating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n\r\n\t\nInstilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nAdapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n\r\n\t\nHolding each other accountable as professionals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nThe team’s Product Owner supports creating a shared understanding among all Scrum team members on the why, the what, and the how. However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.\n \r\n\r\nThe Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers Code Fallacy — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nIf your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”\n\r\n\r\nWhat other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:</p><ul><li>A “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li><li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li><li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li><li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li></ul><p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCSYSDED4C-U&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCSYSDED4C-U&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f67160df06e848ae147a5071256b09e6/href\">https://medium.com/media/f67160df06e848ae147a5071256b09e6/href</a></iframe><h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3><p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code.

As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p><p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option.</p><p>And failure needs to be openly discussed — without repercussions — so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Du0B3Svz7aaY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href\">https://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href</a></iframe><h3>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h3><p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p><p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p><p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

(This aggregation is from the Scrum Guide 2020 Reordered.)\nDownload the ’Scrum Anti-Patterns Guide’ for Free:\n\nThree Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\nLet me point at three Scrum stakeholder failures that have the potential to derail your organization’s attempt at achieving business agility with Scrum:\nTurning the Sprint Review into a Stakeholder Approval Instance\nIn my experience, the Sprint Review acceptance gate by stakeholders is an anti-pattern typical for organizations that are still rooted in the industrial paradigm, exercising command & control. Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\nhttps://medium.com/media/f67160df06e848ae147a5071256b09e6/href\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it.\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.)\nhttps://medium.com/media/8bf7b054d7b65f097a559a52ac6e0a91/href\nThere Is no Failure Culture\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option.\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed — without repercussions — so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\nhttps://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li>\r\n\t<li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>There Is no Failure Culture</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

While stakeholders are not an official accountability, the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum:\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nPage 4: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.\n\r\n\t\nPage 5: The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.\n\r\n\t\nPage 8: The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.\n\r\n\t\nPage 8: [Sprint Planning: Why is this Sprint valuable?] The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nPage 9: The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.\n\r\n\t\nPage 9: During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.\n\r\n\t\nPage 10: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.\n\r\n\t\nPage 10: These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nPage 12: However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.\n\r\n\t\nPage 12: The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on stakeholders. (This aggregation is from the Scrum Guide 2020 Reordered.)\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me point at three Scrum stakeholder failures that have the potential to derail your organization’s attempt at achieving business agility with Scrum:\n\r\n\r\nTurning the Sprint Review into a Stakeholder Approval Instance\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the Sprint Review acceptance gate by stakeholders is an anti-pattern typical for organizations that are still rooted in the industrial paradigm, exercising command & control. Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\n\r\n\t\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\n\r\n\t\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\n \r\n\r\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\n\r\n\r\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Regardless of the skills that we have, the hardest thing for me is to <strong>be neutral</strong>.</p><blockquote>What does it mean to be neutral and why is it so damn hard?</blockquote><p>We need to always go forward in the product iteration and evolve. Our mind is constantly on the hunt for that next killer feature. Most of the time we are too busy trying to find user problems and identifying user drop off that we forget one thing: <strong><em>does this solve anything?</em></strong></p><p>We need to step back for a moment and stop thinking about what we will offer to customers. Instead, empathize about what your customers really want and desire in the first place.</p><p>Humans have the tendency to be biased — and as we spend more time in the product, our thinkings are swayed by cognitive biases. Here are some challenges that we might find as a product manager trying to be neutral:</p><ol><li><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong> — The tendency to search for, interpret, focus, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions.</li><li><strong>The Anchoring Bias</strong>—The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information acquired on that subject.</li><li><strong>The False-Consensus Effect</strong> — The tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with you. The other group that doesn’t agree with you is just outliers.</li></ol><p>Confirmation and anchoring bias is one of the most dangerous biases. Our minds will make excuses to execute a bad product or shot down a good product. The nature of human psychology is that you will mold the reality so hard until it fit the way you think.</p><p>This is where exactly product managers need to be neutral. We need to have the ability to stop seeing our product as an offering or feature, but to see the product as a solution. Do we solve the problem that the customer has? Or do we solve the problem that we have in our minds?</p><blockquote>Never ever fixated on a feature. Focus on what it solves.</blockquote><p>Of course, with that being said, there are some exercises to help reduce cognitive biases in our thinking.

Regardless of the skills that we have, the hardest thing for me is to be neutral.\nWhat does it mean to be neutral and why is it so damn hard?\nWe need to always go forward in the product iteration and evolve. Our mind is constantly on the hunt for that next killer feature. Most of the time we are too busy trying to find user problems and identifying user drop off that we forget one thing: does this solve anything?\nWe need to step back for a moment and stop thinking about what we will offer to customers. Instead, empathize about what your customers really want and desire in the first place.\nHumans have the tendency to be biased — and as we spend more time in the product, our thinkings are swayed by cognitive biases. Here are some challenges that we might find as a product manager trying to be neutral:\n\nConfirmation Bias — The tendency to search for, interpret, focus, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions.\nThe Anchoring Bias—The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information acquired on that subject.\nThe False-Consensus Effect — The tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with you. The other group that doesn’t agree with you is just outliers.\n\nConfirmation and anchoring bias is one of the most dangerous biases. Our minds will make excuses to execute a bad product or shot down a good product. The nature of human psychology is that you will mold the reality so hard until it fit the way you think.\nThis is where exactly product managers need to be neutral. We need to have the ability to stop seeing our product as an offering or feature, but to see the product as a solution. Do we solve the problem that the customer has? Or do we solve the problem that we have in our minds?\nNever ever fixated on a feature. Focus on what it solves.\nOf course, with that being said, there are some exercises to help reduce cognitive biases in our thinking. Here are what we can do:\n\nRecognize the bias: Most likely biases will influence your thinking and recognizing this is the first step to reduce it.\nIdentify the bias: After we can recognize that there are some biases on our thinking, we need to be able to identify what are the biases at play. Try to step back and revisit the information that was processed. Do we process it neutrally? Or do we have preconceptions when we process the information?\nChallenge the bias: After we can identify the bias, now we can challenge it. Try to see the problem or information from someone else’s point of view. Now try to see it under multiple scenarios. Or try to see the information as if you are seeing it for the first time with no background and see how does that change your perception.\n\nTry to do these exercises when making decisions. Hopefully, we can all become a more neutral product manager and see things from where our users see things. Remember, the user of your product is not you — but everyone else.\n\nThe Hardest Thing for Product Managers — Staying Neutral was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Sebastian Yaphy","guid":"https://medium.com/p/2700e604374e","categories":["product-development","psychology","behavioral-science","product-management"],"isoDate":"2021-05-16T16:38:03.000Z"},{"creator":"Stefan Wolpers","title":"Food for Agile Thought #292: The Bottom of Agile, Efficiency is the Enemy, Nijute to Solve Impossible Problems, The Velocity Forecasting Spreadsheet","link":"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-292-bottom-agile/","pubDate":"Sun, 16 May 2021 14:23:25 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>TL; DR: Bottom of Agile, Velocity Forecasting Spreadsheet—Food for Agile Thought #292</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to the 292nd edition of the Food for Agile Thought newsletter, shared with 31,223 peers.

Additionally, we appreciate Troy Magennis’ updated ‘Throughput or Velocity Forecasting Spreadsheet’ for easy Monte Carlo forecasting of agile work. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then address five PO anti-patterns what you can do about them; we introduce the three-step ‘Not Impossible, Just Too Expensive’ approach to problem-solving, and we point at the danger of merely copying what other companies do without understanding the why behind them.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we note that Lean UX principles such as customer centricity or evidence-based decision making do not exist in SAFe.

This week, we get to the Bottom of Agile; we point at the benefits of journaling regarding modern leadership competencies, and we delve into the advantages and psychology of slack time. Additionally, we appreciate Troy Magennis’ updated ‘Throughput or Velocity Forecasting Spreadsheet’ for easy Monte Carlo forecasting of agile work. \n\r\n\r\nWe then address five PO anti-patterns what you can do about them; we introduce the three-step ‘Not Impossible, Just Too Expensive’ approach to problem-solving, and we point at the danger of merely copying what other companies do without understanding the why behind them.\n \r\n\r\nLastly, we note that Lean UX principles such as customer centricity or evidence-based decision making do not exist in SAFe.

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;</li>\r\n\t<li>Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;</li>\r\n\t<li>Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>Holding each other accountable as professionals.</li>\r\n</ul></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#developers\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Over-Delivering Is an Indicator for the Developers’ Lack of Professionalism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This Scrum anti-pattern is easy to spot: The Developers increase the Sprint&#8217;s scope by adding unnecessary effort to work items of Sprint Backlog, also referred to as scope-stretching or gold-plating beyond Done. Typically, this is done without prior consulting of the Product Owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ignorance of previously made agreements during the refinement process may result in a questionable allocation of resources by neglecting basic business principles like considering opportunity costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about when faced with gold-plating? Try to address the following issues in the next Sprint Retrospective:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\u000b\r\n\t<li>Are Developers and the Product Owner talking often enough with each other, is the Product Backlog refinement process up to the job?  \u000b</li>\r\n\t<li>Are the Developers aware that it is their responsibility to make sound investment decisions when creating Product Increments? Good enough, as in “meets the Definition of Done and the intended purpose,” is a viable approach. It does not always need to be the most elegant, best possible quality solution as long as the Increment delivers the intended value. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably, you also want to analyze whether decisions made in the past, for example, the design of extended software architecture, are now driving decisions. So, for example, developers might be doubling down to underline that the previous decision was correct. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, as we are all humans, brace for the occasional over-excitement on the Developers&#8217; side. Sometimes, a third and brand-new JavaScript framework is simply needed in your application. #sigh</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/gold-plating-done-making-your-scrum-work-7/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjxFeaBWWr-k%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gold-Plating Beyond Done  — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to develop an entrepreneurial mindset, not just the Product Owner. The Developers, in particular, are prone to oversee this necessity while at the same time making far-reaching product decisions daily.

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:\n\r\n\r\n\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCreating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n\r\n\t\nInstilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nAdapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n\r\n\t\nHolding each other accountable as professionals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Over-Delivering Is an Indicator for the Developers’ Lack of Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThis Scrum anti-pattern is easy to spot: The Developers increase the Sprint’s scope by adding unnecessary effort to work items of Sprint Backlog, also referred to as scope-stretching or gold-plating beyond Done. Typically, this is done without prior consulting of the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nThis ignorance of previously made agreements during the refinement process may result in a questionable allocation of resources by neglecting basic business principles like considering opportunity costs.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about when faced with gold-plating? Try to address the following issues in the next Sprint Retrospective:\n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nAre Developers and the Product Owner talking often enough with each other, is the Product Backlog refinement process up to the job?  \u000b\n\r\n\t\nAre the Developers aware that it is their responsibility to make sound investment decisions when creating Product Increments? Good enough, as in “meets the Definition of Done and the intended purpose,” is a viable approach. It does not always need to be the most elegant, best possible quality solution as long as the Increment delivers the intended value. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably, you also want to analyze whether decisions made in the past, for example, the design of extended software architecture, are now driving decisions. So, for example, developers might be doubling down to underline that the previous decision was correct. \n\r\n\r\nFinally, as we are all humans, brace for the occasional over-excitement on the Developers’ side. Sometimes, a third and brand-new JavaScript framework is simply needed in your application. #sigh\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nGold-Plating Beyond Done  — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nIf your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to develop an entrepreneurial mindset, not just the Product Owner. The Developers, in particular, are prone to oversee this necessity while at the same time making far-reaching product decisions daily. As Scrum Master and Product Owner, you need to help them fully embrace this level of accountability.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sprint anti-patterns have you observed?

But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">generate as much buy-in as possible</a>, as I explain in more detail in my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16393\">Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People</a>.&#8221; But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don&#8217;t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires <em>full-stack ownership</em>: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a> to the product details. The individual should carry out<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\"> product discovery</a> and strategy work in addition to taking care of the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog work</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">Scaling the Product Owner</a>.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png\" alt=\"Full-stack product owner vs. partial product owner\" class=\"wp-image-17099\" width=\"661\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-300x147.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-768x377.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO.png 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Be therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the product owner, you should focus on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10812\">product</a>, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">sacrifice your health</a>—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">care about the development teams</a> you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-owner-sprint-retrospective/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8232\">sprint retrospective</a>. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how <em>you</em> can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery work</a>, spending more time jointly <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/refining-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15179\">refining the product backlog</a>, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">review finished work</a> results during the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">Refining the product backlog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">writing user stories</a> is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is important that you don&#8217;t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a>, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-planning-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14390\">create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint</a> and succeed in meeting the sprint goal.

It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a <em>product management</em> role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it. To put it differently, you can think of the product owner as a product life-cycle manager, which encourages decisions that result in sustainable growth and consider the product’s longer-term impact on the users and the business. The picture below illustrates this concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png\" alt=\"Product owner and the product life cycle\" class=\"wp-image-17100\" width=\"525\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png 1008w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-300x235.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture above shows how a product might create value over time together with three key events: launching the product, achieving product-market fit, and retiring the product (end of life). Only once it has achieved product-market fit (PMF) and entered the growth stage, has a product started to become successful. A product owner should therefore look after a product at least until PMF, preferably longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with the job of a project manager who is responsible for delivering a project to an agreed scope on time and on budget.

But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal stakeholders such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.\nAt the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and generate as much buy-in as possible, as I explain in more detail in my article “Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People.” But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don’t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.\nMyth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog\nIn Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires full-stack ownership: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the product vision to the product details. The individual should carry out product discovery and strategy work in addition to taking care of the product backlog work.\nBut the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “Scaling the Product Owner.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.\n\nBe therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.\nMyth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance\nAn agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.\nAs it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a Scrum Master or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.\nBut as the product owner, you should focus on the product, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or sacrifice your health—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it’s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.\nAdditionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.\nWhile you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, care about the development teams you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the sprint retrospective. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how you can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in continuous product discovery work, spending more time jointly refining the product backlog, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and review finished work results during the sprint.\nMyth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories\nUser stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. Refining the product backlog and writing user stories is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. \nBut it is important that you don’t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only epics, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, ready items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint and succeed in meeting the sprint goal. If the items are too big and coarse-grained, most teams will struggle. \nTherefore, strike the right balance between strategic and tactical work and spend enough time working on the product backlog together with the development team members. As the product owner, it’s your responsibility that the work required to progress the product and reach the (next) product goal is adequately captured in the product backlog. Such a backlog has enough “ready” high-priority items to guide the work of the development team and to allow its members to create a “done” product increment—executable software that is tested and documented and that could be released.\nMyth #5: It’s the product owner’s job to get the project delivered\nUnlike traditional approaches to software development, Scrum does not offer the role of a project manager. It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a product management role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it.

The opposite is the case: Use the release planning tools and techniques that work for you to track and guide the development progress. But create a continuity of purpose by working with a product roadmap like my GO roadmap that captures the specific outcomes the product is likely to create in the next six to twelve months.\nThe post Five Product Owner Myths Busted appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/\" title=\"Five Product Owner Myths Busted\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ellen-qin-YLeWmBd6miw-unsplash-e1620294977577-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Head\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>The product owner is a role which is often misunderstood and frequently misapplied.

Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Complexity-Stacey-Matrix-Scrum.jpg\" alt=\"Four Scrum Master Success Principles: Complexity, the Stacey Matrix — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65949\" data-wp-pid=\"65949\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Complexity-Stacey-Matrix-Scrum.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Complexity-Stacey-Matrix-Scrum-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Strive for High Product Quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done.

Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice.

I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Value-Rader.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Management, Scrum Values — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65950\" data-wp-pid=\"65950\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Value-Rader.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Value-Rader-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>All sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people.com/events/\" title=\"Professional Scrum Classes by PST Stefan Wolpers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming training classes here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective.

Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more than 195 peers from May 27-29, 2021, for the Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021, a live virtual Barcamp using open space technology principles and practices.\n\r\n\r\nMeeting Stakeholder Expectations\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how diverse the stakeholders of your Scrum Team are, they are all united in one expectation: Your Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience, four first principles support Scrum Masters to help their teams deliver on this expectation:\n\r\n\r\nChoose Scrum for the Right Purpose\n\r\n\r\nChoosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nCreate and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my upcoming training classes here.\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\n\r\n\r\nIt helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nWhat principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

We appreciate a new ebook on dealing with difficult stakeholders and critical situations, and we learn a simple approach to measuring team productivity: Don’t touch velocity! </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we learn that Gitlab identified a new DevOps maturity model. </p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #291: Hypotheses Validation, Authentic Feedback, Measuring Productivity, The Art of Removing Features — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65945\" data-wp-pid=\"65945\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65937\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-290-design-thinking-scrum/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #290: Design Thinking Scrum, Product vs. Project Teams, Agile Leadership Practice Library, Disrupting Disrupters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #290</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-retrospective\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Sprint Retrospective\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about it?

Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThe Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: \n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nCommitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b\n\r\n\t\nIf Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure.

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner\" title=\"The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Oversized Product Backlogs</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>The Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Garbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers &#038; the organization. </li>\r\n\t<li>The Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpet3ZRyTx34%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Product Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You are likely to end up in a feature factory.</li>\r\n\t<li>Probably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" title=\"Conway’s law\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conway’s law</a>: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.”)</li>\r\n\t<li>If you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fgc15kRtrNVg%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>I Know What to Build—Follow Me!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks &#038; balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0Zl-FMOjS9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Product Owner failures have you observed?

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:\n\r\n\r\nOversized Product Backlogs\n \r\n\r\nThe Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nGarbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are likely to end up in a feature factory.\n\r\n\t\nProbably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (Conway’s law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”)\n\r\n\t\nIf you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know What to Build—Follow Me!\n\r\n\r\nIn this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. \n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks & balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Product Owner failures have you observed?

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want to offer a product that <em>reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes </em>and that <em>generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app</em>. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">strategy validation techniques</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> I have captured on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">Product Goals in Scrum</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to <em>allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base</em>. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen <em>user feedback</em>, <em>net promoter score</em>, and <em>referral rate</em>, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, <em>acquire an initial user base</em>, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Health Indicators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/technical-debt-and-product-success/\">technical debt</a>, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less is More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better. This includes the analytics tools we have available today. These powerful tools usually generate more data for us than we can handle. And herein lies the issue: There is no point in measuring everything that can be measured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using more KPIs than necessary and analysing data that provides no value is a waste of time. In the worst case, you act on irrelevant data and make wrong decisions. Think of driving a car.

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.\nA Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs\nTo select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the product strategy to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the product goals on the product roadmap to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.\nAs you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.\nStep 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals\nTo select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the product strategy. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. \nSay I want to offer a product that reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes and that generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).\nNote that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few strategy validation techniques.\nStep 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs\nIn addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the product goals I have captured on the product roadmap in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “Product Goals in Scrum.”\nSay the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen user feedback, net promoter score, and referral rate, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, acquire an initial user base, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.\nStep 3: Add Health Indicators\nMeasuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. \nBut if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in technical debt, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. \nIt is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.\nLess is More\nHaving been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better. This includes the analytics tools we have available today. These powerful tools usually generate more data for us than we can handle. And herein lies the issue: There is no point in measuring everything that can be measured.\nUsing more KPIs than necessary and analysing data that provides no value is a waste of time. In the worst case, you act on irrelevant data and make wrong decisions. Think of driving a car. A small number of indicators are helpful for safely getting to your destination, including how fast you are travelling and how much battery/fuel is left. If the car dashboard continuously showed a range of other data, such as tyre pressure or ABS status, it would be harder to take in the relevant information and make the right decisions while driving. \nTherefore, limit the number of KPIs you use. Carefully select them by using the factors discussed above, and regularly review and adjust them. Don’t make the mistake of allowing powerful stakeholders to dictate KPIs to you. Instead, explain to them how effective product KPIs are derived, and consider inviting them to the next product strategy workshop in order to collaboratively determine the right KPIs.\nThe post How to Choose the Right KPIs for Your Product appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-kpis-for-your-product/#respond","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-kpis-for-your-product/\" title=\"How to Choose the Right KPIs for Your Product\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/diana-polekhina-iUfusOthmgQ-unsplash-e1615375042653-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Measuring tape\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>A key challenge of working with KPIs is to select the right indicators: There are so many different metrics to choose from including daily active users, net promoter score, and profit, to name just a few.

I got to say things like “I’ve never ordered so much Goldbelly!” while others lost paychecks and family members. My friend Nikhil summarized so many of my thoughts in his essay&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nbt.substack.com/p/a-widening-gap\">A Widening Gap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A widening gap. A gap between the “haves” and the “have nots,” between those with disposable income and those that don’t have jobs.&nbsp;A gap between fact and fiction, between those that have access to the truth and those that are fed lies non-stop. A gap that’s been exacerbated by the pandemic, certainly, but also by the forces of technology, media, and politics, not just in the last four years, but for the past decade.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It will take considerable work, across technology, media, and government, to reverse this course.

Beyond structural change, if we each just cared for a handful of other people in a way that extended beyond our immediate circles, we’d make so much progress.

People close to me have dealt with various addictions, including alcohol, and many more have removed it from their lifestyle in the interest of health, mental clarity and other benefits. Fortunately I’m not prone to over-consumption and my interest has been as much about the history, business and people around the spirit as actual consumption (I’m basically a 1–4 oz type of guy — for reference, the average 750ml bottle is roughly 25 ounces).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d previously been whiskey-curious, buying a bottle every now and then, trying different bourbons in a bar and so on.

The rest of the product backlog emerges to define ‘what’ will fulfill the product goal.” The product owner is accountable for “developing and explicitly communicating the product goal.” The entire Scrum team is “focused on one … product goal” at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this definition leaves you scratching your head, don’t worry. Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied.

Some view it as the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a>, others equate it to the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">value proposition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a <em>specific and measurable benefit or outcome</em> a product should create in the course of the next <em>two to six months</em>. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are <em>connected to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a></em> and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16846\" width=\"482\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png 993w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-300x252.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-768x644.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The Product Goal in Context</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal.

When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal. It took me years to come up with the set of goals in figure 1. In hindsight, the set looks disappointingly simple <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the contents of this article on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my YouTube Channel</a>:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Product Goals In Scrum\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0NWukbHkDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sample Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand how the goals in figure 1 can be applied, let’s take a look at an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16847\" width=\"491\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-300x237.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-768x606.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Sample Goals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 2, I first captured the vision “Help people eat healthily” and then used it to choose the user and business goals “Reduce the risk of developing type-two diabetes; create new revenue source.” In order to determine the right product goal, I asked myself, “What would be a first good step to meet the from the user and business goal?” I consequently chose the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” I then used this goal to determine the right sprint goal. I figured that finding out if users are willing to share personal information when activating the app would be the most important risk to address and hence should be the goal of the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I chose to use a <em>compound product goal</em> in figure 2 that has a user part—help the users understand their eating habits and business—and a business one—acquire an initial user base. Both parts are closely connected: In order to acquire a user base, the product must offer tangible value to the users, and a first step to help people eat more healthily is to help them become aware of their current eating habits. You don’t have to work with compound product goals of course, if you prefer to focus your objectives on either the user or the business benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Roadmap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting a single product goal is great. But unless you can’t see further than the next few months, I recommend determining the next three to four product goals and capturing them on your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, as figure 3 below shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16848\" width=\"569\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-300x197.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-768x505.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals.png 1197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Sample GO Product Roadmap with Product Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 3 shows a sample roadmap based on my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/the-go-product-roadmap/\">GO product roadmap template</a>, which contains three product goals. Each goal builds on the previous one thereby nicely progressing the product: The first goal helps the users become aware of their eating habits and creates and initial user base. The second one helps people improve their eating habits and acquires additional users. The third product goal, finally, helps the users improve their overall fitness and generates revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Scrum Guide does not mention identifying future product goals and adding them to the product roadmap, I find this practice very helpful: Stakeholders and dev teams usually benefit from understanding how to product is likely to evolve beyond the next two to three months. This helps the individuals create an effective sales and marketing strategy, for example, and to make the right architecture and technology decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Backlog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a product roadmap in place, I like to select the product goal to be worked on and copy it from the roadmap to the product backlog together with any coarse-grained features that are associated with the goal. This approach is illustrated by figure 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16849\" width=\"570\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-300x81.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-768x207.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog.png 1187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Product Goal and Product Backlog</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of using a product goal in the backlog is that it focuses the latter, as I describe in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">The Product Roadmap and the Product Backlog</a>.” This addresses a common issue: Many product backlogs I have seen over the years were too big and too detailed. This made them hard to prioritise and difficult to update, which is bad news as long as your product is young or experiences more than small, incremental changes. In most cases, the product backlogs grew so big because they lacked a measure to decide which items should be added to the backlog and which should not. The product goal is this measure: <em>Only add an item to the product backlog if it helps meet the product goal</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s briefly explore how a product goal might be used on the product backlog. Say I was to start the development of my healthy eating product, I would copy the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base” into the product backlog together with the features “healthy eating dashboard” and “integration with smart watches and fitness devices.” I’d ask myself which additional features are required to meet the product goal and add these to the backlog. I would the start breaking some of the features into <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"538\">prioritise the product backlog</a>. Finally, I’d refine the high-priority items to be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> to start the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can tell, I like product goals and find them very helpful, and I would encourage you to try them out if you haven’t used them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">Product Goals in Scrum</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Product Goals Defined\nThe Scrum Guide released in November 2020 states that “the product goal describes a future state of the product … [It] is the long-term objective for the Scrum team.” It also suggests that “the product goal is in the product backlog.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”</h3><p>(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up <a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/\">here</a>.)</p><p>Given rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.</p><p>To answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Seek high-growth companies.</strong> These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.</li><li><strong>Build your network of peers and mentors.</strong> These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.</li><li><strong>Be ready to learn and unlearn.</strong> One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.</li><li><strong>Working with humans is hard! </strong>Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.</li></ol><p>Below, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.</p><h3>1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)</h3><p>Trip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.</p><p>Early at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:</p><ol><li><strong>How to ship a product on time.</strong> Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.</li><li><strong>How to deal with imposter syndrome.</strong> Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”</li></ol><p>Electronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.</p><p>In my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:</p><ol><li>Here’s what you did well</li><li>Here’s what you could have done better.</li></ol><p>My mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.</p><h3>1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)</h3><p>Greg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:</p><ol><li><strong>Greg forced me out of the building to connect with peers.</strong> He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.</li><li><strong>Greg helped me to transition into a formal leader.</strong> I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.</li></ol><p>Louis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:</p><ol><li><strong>How to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively.</strong> You can read my “<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/branding-for-builders-19e103ef3f1d\">Branding for Builders</a>” essay to learn more.</li><li><strong>How to form successful work relationships.</strong> Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:</li></ol><ul><li>Form (get to know each other to build trust)</li><li>Storm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)</li><li>Norm (develop shared ideas and approaches)</li><li>Perform (based on shared ideas and process)</li></ul><p>I learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.</p><p>Last, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.</p><p>Upon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.</p><h3>The Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)</h3><p>The Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)</p><p>My leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”</p><p>He answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”</p><p>I laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”</p><p>The reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.</p><p>My biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.</p><h3>1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company</h3><p>After two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:</p><blockquote><em>“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we </em>finally<em> talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”</em></blockquote><p>Jonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.</p><p>That week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.</p><h3>2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup</h3><p>Keith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.</p><h3>2005: Netflix</h3><p>When I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:</p><ol><li>“Can you delight customers?”</li><li>“Can you do consumer science?”</li></ol><p>I answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:</p><ol><li><strong>Delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways.</strong> I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/intro-to-product-strategy-60bdf72b17e3\">Here’s</a> my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)</li><li><strong>The power of simplicity.</strong> One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.</li><li><strong>The balancing act of qualitative and quantitative.</strong> In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.</li><li><strong>The downside of management.</strong> Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.</li><li><strong>I learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business</strong>. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes. The Netflix culture — its articulation of the values, skills, and behaviors desired for all employees — enabled individuals to make significant decisions without even talking to one another.</li></ol><p>Leslie Kilgore ran Marketing at Netflix. While Reed was “all in” on AB testing, Leslie helped me form the customer’s voice in my head through qualitative. Her coaching:</p><ol><li><strong>Get outside Silicon Valley.</strong> We moved beyond “Silicon Valley Freaks” to find “normal” customers in Providence, Memphis, and Denver, among other cities.</li><li><strong>Get to the “why” through qualitative.</strong> Leslie often had a live video feed of focus groups playing in her cube. In a building full of “quant jocks,” it was helpful to get insight into the “why” of customer behavior by listening to our members in focus groups and usability. Leslie was an effective counter-voice to Reed.</li><li><strong>Test big changes.</strong> We did lots of testing of our non-member site — our site’s front door. One day Leslie looked down at a print-out of six versions going into the next AB test. In looking at the postage-stamp-sized designs, she struggled to see the differences. She remarked, “If we can’t see the deltas in each version, our customers will never notice them. Our members are way too busy to detect nuance.”</li><li><strong>The dance between marketing and product. </strong>Sometimes we’d test a hypothesis for a new feature on the non-member homepage to see if it improved conversion, and if it did, we’d build the feature. In other cases, the product evolved, and we’d bring attention to a new feature on the non-member homepage later. This “Tango” between product development and marketing continued forever.</li></ol><p>The last person at Netflix who fundamentally influenced my thinking is Patty McCord, the Chief People Officer. She helped me to solve many “people problems” in a highly leveraged way.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”\n(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up here.)\nGiven rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.\nTo answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:\n\nSeek high-growth companies. These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.\nBuild your network of peers and mentors. These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.\nBe ready to learn and unlearn. One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.\nWorking with humans is hard! Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.\n\nBelow, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.\n1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)\nTrip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.\nEarly at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:\n\nHow to ship a product on time. Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.\nHow to deal with imposter syndrome. Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”\n\nElectronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.\nIn my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:\n\nHere’s what you did well\nHere’s what you could have done better.\n\nMy mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.\n1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)\nGreg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:\n\nGreg forced me out of the building to connect with peers. He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.\nGreg helped me to transition into a formal leader. I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.\n\nLouis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:\n\nHow to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively. You can read my “Branding for Builders” essay to learn more.\nHow to form successful work relationships. Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:\n\nForm (get to know each other to build trust)\nStorm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)\nNorm (develop shared ideas and approaches)\nPerform (based on shared ideas and process)\n\nI learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.\nLast, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.\nUpon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.\nThe Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)\nThe Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)\nMy leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”\nHe answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”\nI laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”\nThe reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.\nMy biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.\n1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company\nAfter two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:\n“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we finally talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”\nJonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.\nThat week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.\n2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup\nKeith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.\n2005: Netflix\nWhen I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:\n\n“Can you delight customers?”\n“Can you do consumer science?”\n\nI answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:\n\nDelight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (Here’s my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)\nThe power of simplicity. One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.\nThe balancing act of qualitative and quantitative. In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.\nThe downside of management. Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.\nI learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes. The Netflix culture — its articulation of the values, skills, and behaviors desired for all employees — enabled individuals to make significant decisions without even talking to one another.\n\nLeslie Kilgore ran Marketing at Netflix. While Reed was “all in” on AB testing, Leslie helped me form the customer’s voice in my head through qualitative. Her coaching:\n\nGet outside Silicon Valley. We moved beyond “Silicon Valley Freaks” to find “normal” customers in Providence, Memphis, and Denver, among other cities.\nGet to the “why” through qualitative. Leslie often had a live video feed of focus groups playing in her cube. In a building full of “quant jocks,” it was helpful to get insight into the “why” of customer behavior by listening to our members in focus groups and usability. Leslie was an effective counter-voice to Reed.\nTest big changes. We did lots of testing of our non-member site — our site’s front door. One day Leslie looked down at a print-out of six versions going into the next AB test. In looking at the postage-stamp-sized designs, she struggled to see the differences. She remarked, “If we can’t see the deltas in each version, our customers will never notice them. Our members are way too busy to detect nuance.”\nThe dance between marketing and product. Sometimes we’d test a hypothesis for a new feature on the non-member homepage to see if it improved conversion, and if it did, we’d build the feature. In other cases, the product evolved, and we’d bring attention to a new feature on the non-member homepage later. This “Tango” between product development and marketing continued forever.\n\nThe last person at Netflix who fundamentally influenced my thinking is Patty McCord, the Chief People Officer. She helped me to solve many “people problems” in a highly leveraged way. Her advice:\nWhen presented with a problem from an employee, ask the following question: “When you talked to this person about the issue, what did he or she say.”\nIn 80% of the cases, the person would go back, talk to the other person, and solve the problem independently. This tactic also helped Netflix to build a culture of “well-formed adults.”\nPatty also interviewed me at Netflix. She asked me to playback some of my key learnings in my career, and I repeated a long list of stories much like this essay. She taught me to focus on product leaders’ ability to adapt and learn as you evaluate their potential for success. Learning by doing, plus seeking out a network of peers and mentors, is critical in fast-changing industries like ours.\nAt Netflix, I quickly embraced the two-week push cycle. I “unlearned” waterfall development and learned to build new products and features in an agile way. I found it an easy transition, likely because of our design, engineering, and data partners’ talent level, as well as Netflix’s well-developed tools and systems. The transition from waterfall to agile is one of the many examples of learning and unlearning that I navigated over three decades. (Barry O’Reilly wrote a book, Unlearn, that focuses on this phenomenon.)\n2010: Chegg, a textbook rental & homework help company\nDan Rosensweig was the CEO at Chegg. He helped me to:\n\nFully commit to “What’s Next?” Chegg was a textbook rental company, but Dan wanted us to be much more. We eventually bought six startups to invent a high-margin digital business.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDjkQxXw-2U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Brave New Agile World</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">collaborate much more closely</a>. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/think-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"553\">product-led approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early user feedback, frequent solution validation</strong>: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/beyond-product-demo-validation-techniques-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7876\">validate our ideas</a> and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced time-to-market</strong>: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a> that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better product quality and improved adaptability</strong>: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better requirements</strong>: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\">dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work</a> and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparent development progress</strong>: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">The progress is now based on working software</a> rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved alignment</strong>: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">sprint reviews</a>. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">involving them in the process of making product decisions</a> increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivated productive teams</strong>: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Old and New Product Management Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of empowerment</strong>: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-manager-vs-product-owner/\"><em>product owner</em> instead of <em>product manager</em></a> in order to emphasise the level of <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"12541\">authority and empowerment</a> a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confusion about roles and responsibilities</strong>: Even 20 years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> was conceived, agile roles like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">product owner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the <a href=\"https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scrum Guide</a> puts it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of direct interaction with users and customers</strong>: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">agile manifesto</a>. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13288\">empathise with the users and customers</a> and to fully understand their needs.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.\nDuring the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.\nThis sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.\nYou can also access the content of this article on my YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brave New Agile World\nAs agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to collaborate much more closely. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a product-led approach.\nEarly user feedback, frequent solution validation: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us validate our ideas and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.\nReduced time-to-market: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as user stories that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.\nBetter product quality and improved adaptability: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.\nBetter requirements: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.\nTransparent development progress: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: The progress is now based on working software rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.\nImproved alignment: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like sprint reviews. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and involving them in the process of making product decisions increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.\nMotivated productive teams: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.\nOld and New Product Management Challenges\nWhile agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.\nLack of empowerment: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term product owner instead of product manager in order to emphasise the level of authority and empowerment a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.\nUnfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.\nConfusion about roles and responsibilities: Even 20 years after the Manifesto for Agile Software Development was conceived, agile roles like product owner and Scrum Master are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the Scrum Guide puts it.\nLack of direct interaction with users and customers: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the agile manifesto. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to empathise with the users and customers and to fully understand their needs. This, in turn, reduces the chances of offering a product that does a great job for its target audience and generates the desired business benefits.\nProduct discovery and product strategy poorly practiced: The most beautiful user stories are useless if it’s not clear who the users are and why they would want to use the product. Acquiring this information requires focused product discovery and strategy work. Unfortunately, product discovery and strategy aren’t always effectively practiced. This is not helped by the fact that agile approaches like Scrum do not offer any tools and techniques to help product owners understand if a product should be developed. Fortunately, a number of tools and techniques have emerged in recent years that help product people with their product discovery and strategy work including my product vision board and GO product roadmap.\nLack of sustainable pace: “The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely,” states the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Ironically, working at a healthy, sustainable pace can be particularly challenging in an agile context: Product people have to regularly interact with development teams in order to update the product backlog, agree on sprint goals, answer questions, and provide feedback on product increments in addition to all the other product management duties. Being overworked, however, has a negative impact on our productivity and mental health. Luckily, there are a number of practical measures you can take to achieve sustainable pace. These include not covering other people jobs on a continued basis—like acting as a stand-in Scrum Master—and having the courage to decline stakeholder requests. Please see my article “Sustainable Pace in Product Management” for more guidance.\nLooking into the Crystal Ball\nSo where do we go from here? How will product management change over the next 20 years, and which role will agile methods play—if any?\nWithout having a crystal ball at my disposal, I believe that the future of product management will be shaped by our ability to address the product management challenges mentioned above. I sincerely hope that in 20 years from now, empowerment will no longer be a significant issue, product roles will be better understood and more effectively applied, and product discovery and strategy will always be practiced by anybody who manages or owns a product. I also believe that agile methods will continue to enrich product management, alongside other influences that have emerged in the last few years including Lean Startup and business modelling. \nWhile there is still plenty of work to be done, I am optimistic about the future of product management and agile.\nThe post How Agile Has Changed Product Management appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-agile-has-changed-product-management/#respond","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-agile-has-changed-product-management/\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ross-findon-mG28olYFgHI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Change\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>As the Manifesto for Agile Software Development celebrates its 20th anniversary, I take a look at how agile practices have influenced and changed product management.

You might not want to disappoint John in the example above, you might worry that saying no will anger him and lead to conflict, or you might not want to be seen as a naysayer but somebody who has a can-do attitude and wants to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying no, however, is part and parcel of a product person’s job. If you said yes to every idea and request, you would end up with a <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adrenaline-Junkies-Template-Zombies-Understanding/dp/0932633676/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">feature soup</a></em>, a product with an uncompelling value proposition and a poor user experience. As Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe, however, that it would be impossible for you to say no to John, then this may indicate that you are not properly empowered, that you lack the authority and respect required to be in charge of the product and be responsible for its success. If that’s the case, explore how you can strengthen your product leadership. Refer to my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a>&#8221; for more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empathise with the Stakeholder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having decided that you can’t accept John’s request, you might be tempted to share your view with the individual and say, for instance: “Sorry, John. But there is no way that I can add the feature to the current release. The development team is struggling to implement the agreed features, and, as you know, we can’t push out the date.” This might seem like a reasonable answer: It’s direct and it offers an explanation. But would it be effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If John does not feel heard and understood, it will be hard for him to accept no as an answer, no matter how valid your arguments are. Instead, he might feel rejected and react with disappointment or anger. He might think that you don’t appreciate his views and don’t care about his needs. Consequently, John may no longer fully trust and support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this situation and maximise the chances that John can receive a no, empathise with the individual before you offer an answer. Find out why the feature is important to John. What is his personal, vested interest in getting the feature included in the release? Why does it matter to him? Only if John feels understood will he open up to your perspective, listen to your arguments, and accept that you can’t add the feature to the release. The following <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\">listening techniques</a> will help you with this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give your full attention to the individual. Maintain eye contact and show the person that you are interested in what she or he has to say.</li><li>Keep an <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/growth-mindset-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14188\">open mind</a> even if you disagree with what you are hearing or if you dislike the individual. Listen with the intention to understand, not to answer. John might be right, after all, and you should add the feature to the release.</li><li>Pay attention to the person’s body language. Non-verbal information—like voice pitch and volume, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movement—expresses the speaker’s feelings, which help you uncover the individual’s underlying interests.</li><li>Ask clarifying and probing questions to check that you have correctly understood what was said and encourage the other person to provide more information. You might say, for instance, “Can you please help me understand why adding the feature is important to you?”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reframe the Conversati<strong>on</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">Stakeholders</a> often request specific features without necessarily being fully aware of the problem it addresses. But value is hardly created by adding a single piece of functionality—at least as long as a product is young or changing. Instead of debating an individual feature with John, reframe the conversation. Explore which user or customer problem the functionality would help address. How would implementing the feature benefit these individuals? Why do some customers view it as crucial, to stay with the example above? And would there be an alternative way to achieve the desired impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if the feature is aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goal</a> of the current development effort, the outcome you want to achieve, for example, to enter a new market or to increase engagement. Will addressing the user problem help you meet this goal and create the desired benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then you should consider adapting the development effort. You may decide to add the feature to the release, assuming that you make appropriate adjustments like reducing or removing other features or moving the delivery date. But if the answer is no, then you should decline the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Rush the Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be tempting to quickly make a decision just to be done with it.

He is adamant that the feature must be added, and he doesn’t want to accept your view. What’s more, he suggests that you don’t understand what the customers want, and he threatens to escalate the issue if you decline his request. In such a situation, it’s natural to feel difficult emotions like confusion, worry, and anger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, it’s best to pause the conversation and to postpone the decision to regain a cool head and allow the difficult feelings to subside. You might say to John, “It’s really important to me that we find a good solution. But I am feeling upset right now, and I need some time to reflect on what I heard you say. Let’s please continue the conversation in the afternoon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if you can and should make the decision on your own. If the decision has a bigger impact, if you require other people’s input to make the right decision, or if you want to secure their buy-in, I recommend scheduling a meeting with all the key stakeholders and the development team representatives in order to discuss and evaluate the feature request and make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">joint decision</a>. You might even find that you need to run an experiment and collect relevant data, for instance, by interviewing users or releasing a feature fake, before you can make the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try to Find Common Ground, but Don’t Split the Difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While saying no is sometimes unavoidable, I recommend that you explore if there is an alternative way to meet the stakeholder’s underlying need.

John mentions the upcoming product release and says, “You really must add the enhanced reporting feature.

They did this by balancing delight against margin (profit) while building a durable, hard-to-copy advantage. I call it the <strong>DHM</strong> model: <strong>D</strong>elight customers in <strong>H</strong>ard-to-copy, <strong>M</strong>argin-enhancing ways.</p><p>Today, Netflix’s hard-to-copy attributes are:</p><ul><li>unique technology (personalization, streaming encoding)</li><li>network effects (a large device ecosystem)</li><li>economies of scale (a $20B annual content spend), and a</li><li>trusted brand</li></ul><p>A challenge along the way: How do you evaluate trade-offs between delight and margin? When might you choose to lose money to delight customers?</p><p>Below, I answer both of these questions using two Netflix cases, using directional data.</p><p><strong>2005: The Perfect New Release Experiment</strong></p><p>In 2005, Netflix had one million members in its nascent DVD-by-mail service. The most frequent customer request? Faster new release DVD delivery. The challenge: three months after a movie appeared in theaters, Studios released the DVD version — and as soon as that DVD version dropped, lots of customers wanted it immediately. Within a few months, however, demand decreased as the novelty wore off.</p><p>Rather than buying up a surplus of newly released DVDs to handle that short-term spike in demand, we decided to optimize for the long-term. As a result, during the first few months after a DVD launch, some customers had to wait a week or two to get the new release. If the new release wasn’t available when the customer requested it, we shipped the next movie on the customer’s movie list, then sent the new release when it became available.</p><p>In response to customer requests for faster DVD delivery, we designed a “perfect new release” A/B test and allocated 10,000 customers to the test cell. These customers received their new release DVDs the next day, while customers in the control cell waited for weeks or months to get their new releases. Our delight metric? Retention.</p><p>The questions we hoped to answer:</p><ul><li>Will faster new release DVD delivery improve retention, and, if so, by how much? (At the time, roughly 4.5% of our customers canceled each month).</li><li>If this experience improves retention, is it worth spending more money on DVD inventory? How much more?</li></ul><p>The answer: Yes, faster new release delivery improved retention, but by much less than we expected. The monthly cancel rate improved by about 0.05% — from 4.50% to 4.45%. So, was it worth spending more money on the new release DVD inventory?</p><p>Here’s how we evaluated the balance between delight and margin:</p><ul><li>If we rolled out this “perfect new release” experience to all members, we’d save 5,000 customers/year. (One million subscribers x .05 retention improvement = 5,000 saved customers).</li><li>We believed happier customers would rave about the service, attracting new members via word of mouth, so we doubled the number of saved customers. We estimated that each “saved” customer would attract one new member to the service.</li><li>The value of this perfect new release experience was $1 million: 5,000 saved customers x $100 (the lifetime value of a customer) X 2 for the WOM factor.</li></ul><p>But the cost to deliver that perfect new release experience was $5 million in additional DVD inventory. Given the potential gain of $1 million against a $5M spend, we chose not to roll the feature out to all members.</p><p>What we learned:</p><ol><li>What customers say doesn’t always match their behavior. You need A/B testing to measure behavior change.</li><li>It’s helpful to understand how much customers value different features. We invested in things our members valued (broader DVD selection, lower prices, next-day DVD delivery). We invested less in features they didn’t value (new release DVDs, social, unique movie-finding tools).</li></ol><p>We never established a more precise word-of-mouth factor, though I’ve heard that Amazon sometimes uses an 8X factor. A large WOM multiple encourages more investment in customer delight, but at the time, we couldn’t afford to spend $5 million for a marginal retention improvement.</p><p><strong>2016: The Free Trial Reminder Experiment</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fTpYyZM_pvOCBX6V\" /></figure><p>Netflix’s non-member page is the store window for the service. It invites customers to input their credit card for a free, one-month trial. At the end of this first month, customers convert to paying members — unless they cancel before their one-month free trial ends.</p><p>By 2016, Netflix had nearly 100 million members:</p><ul><li>2% of visitors to the non-member page signed up for a one month trial, and</li><li>90% of these customers transitioned into paid membership at the end of the month.</li></ul><p>The challenge: Many customers called customer support on Day 32 to explain they had forgotten to cancel the service. The customer service agents canceled each customer’s subscription and refunded their money, but this practice cost Netflix around $10M/year.</p><p>To decrease these customer service calls, Netflix tested a free trial reminder. On day 28 of the free trial, Netflix sent texts and emails to new customers: “Your one-month free trial is about to end. Click here if you’d like to cancel.” The result? A drop in paid conversion from 90% to 85%, resulting in a $50M loss. (The 5% decrease in conversion translated to a total loss of $60M, but the $10 million in “I forgot to cancel” customer service calls dropped to zero.)</p><p>If you were the product manager, what would you do?</p><p>Netflix chose to make the free trial reminder part of the default experience. Why? Customers are delighted by Netflix’s effort to make it easy to cancel. The free trial reminder builds trust, which creates a more robust, world-class brand. Although Netflix loses $50 million, it builds a long-term advantage through its hard-to-copy brand. Last, A/B tests can’t measure everything — some customers who canceled may tell a friend about Netflix’s gracious free trial reminders or return to sign up for the service a few months later.</p><p>A/B tests can’t measure all of these factors, which is why judgment and strategic frameworks like the DHM model (Delight customers in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways) are critical.</p><p><strong>The difference between the 2005 and 2016 decisions: The magnitude of investment</strong></p><p>In 2005, Netflix couldn’t afford an additional $5 million for new release inventory. By 2016, however, Netflix revenues were nearly $10B. In 2005, spending $5 million on additional new release DVDs was a high-stakes decision. In 2016, the decision to leave $50 million on the table to build long-term value was a low-stakes decision. This loss was only half a percent of total revenue. Plus, the decision would be easy to reverse (this is the second attribute of low-stakes decisions). Netflix could always choose to stop sending end of free trial reminders.</p><p>When you make product decisions, ask yourself if it’s a high or low-stakes decision. If the magnitude is high and it’s hard to reverse, consider the decision carefully. Give it plenty of time, and gather as much data as possible. If the stakes are low and the decision is easy to reverse, decide quickly, then move on. Most decisions by product leaders are low stakes (although they almost always believe the opposite). Postponing decisions creates ambiguity, which makes things worse. Be decisive.</p><p>As a product leader, your job is to delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. The challenge is to measure these factors and assess trade-offs between each. With practice, you’ll learn what customers value and what they don’t. The DHM model, together with A/B testing, provides critical insight to build both a world-class product and brand.</p><p>I hope you find this helpful.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Gib</p><p>Gibson Biddle</p><p><a href=\"http://gibsonbiddle.com\">gibsonbiddle.com</a></p><p>P.S. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HowToDHMEssay\">Click here</a> to provide feedback on this essay — it takes just one minute.</p><p>Read my free “<a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/\">Ask Gib” product newsletter</a> on Substack.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ee53e77b214d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","content:encodedSnippet":"Two Netflix cases illustrate how the DHM strategy model helps product leaders balance delight and margin.\nOver two decades, Netflix improved its subscribers’ monthly cancel rate from 10% to 2%.

We estimated that each “saved” customer would attract one new member to the service.\nThe value of this perfect new release experience was $1 million: 5,000 saved customers x $100 (the lifetime value of a customer) X 2 for the WOM factor.\n\nBut the cost to deliver that perfect new release experience was $5 million in additional DVD inventory. Given the potential gain of $1 million against a $5M spend, we chose not to roll the feature out to all members.\nWhat we learned:\n\nWhat customers say doesn’t always match their behavior. You need A/B testing to measure behavior change.\nIt’s helpful to understand how much customers value different features. We invested in things our members valued (broader DVD selection, lower prices, next-day DVD delivery). We invested less in features they didn’t value (new release DVDs, social, unique movie-finding tools).\n\nWe never established a more precise word-of-mouth factor, though I’ve heard that Amazon sometimes uses an 8X factor. A large WOM multiple encourages more investment in customer delight, but at the time, we couldn’t afford to spend $5 million for a marginal retention improvement.\n2016: The Free Trial Reminder Experiment\n\nNetflix’s non-member page is the store window for the service. It invites customers to input their credit card for a free, one-month trial. At the end of this first month, customers convert to paying members — unless they cancel before their one-month free trial ends.\nBy 2016, Netflix had nearly 100 million members:\n\n2% of visitors to the non-member page signed up for a one month trial, and\n90% of these customers transitioned into paid membership at the end of the month.\n\nThe challenge: Many customers called customer support on Day 32 to explain they had forgotten to cancel the service. The customer service agents canceled each customer’s subscription and refunded their money, but this practice cost Netflix around $10M/year.\nTo decrease these customer service calls, Netflix tested a free trial reminder. On day 28 of the free trial, Netflix sent texts and emails to new customers: “Your one-month free trial is about to end. Click here if you’d like to cancel.” The result? A drop in paid conversion from 90% to 85%, resulting in a $50M loss. (The 5% decrease in conversion translated to a total loss of $60M, but the $10 million in “I forgot to cancel” customer service calls dropped to zero.)\nIf you were the product manager, what would you do?\nNetflix chose to make the free trial reminder part of the default experience. Why? Customers are delighted by Netflix’s effort to make it easy to cancel. The free trial reminder builds trust, which creates a more robust, world-class brand. Although Netflix loses $50 million, it builds a long-term advantage through its hard-to-copy brand. Last, A/B tests can’t measure everything — some customers who canceled may tell a friend about Netflix’s gracious free trial reminders or return to sign up for the service a few months later.\nA/B tests can’t measure all of these factors, which is why judgment and strategic frameworks like the DHM model (Delight customers in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways) are critical.\nThe difference between the 2005 and 2016 decisions: The magnitude of investment\nIn 2005, Netflix couldn’t afford an additional $5 million for new release inventory. By 2016, however, Netflix revenues were nearly $10B. In 2005, spending $5 million on additional new release DVDs was a high-stakes decision. In 2016, the decision to leave $50 million on the table to build long-term value was a low-stakes decision. This loss was only half a percent of total revenue. Plus, the decision would be easy to reverse (this is the second attribute of low-stakes decisions). Netflix could always choose to stop sending end of free trial reminders.\nWhen you make product decisions, ask yourself if it’s a high or low-stakes decision. If the magnitude is high and it’s hard to reverse, consider the decision carefully. Give it plenty of time, and gather as much data as possible. If the stakes are low and the decision is easy to reverse, decide quickly, then move on. Most decisions by product leaders are low stakes (although they almost always believe the opposite). Postponing decisions creates ambiguity, which makes things worse. Be decisive.\nAs a product leader, your job is to delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. The challenge is to measure these factors and assess trade-offs between each. With practice, you’ll learn what customers value and what they don’t. The DHM model, together with A/B testing, provides critical insight to build both a world-class product and brand.\nI hope you find this helpful.\nBest,\nGib\nGibson Biddle\ngibsonbiddle.com\nP.S.

An objective describes<em> what </em>is to be achieved. The key results state <em>how</em> we accomplish the objective. Let’s say, for example, that the objective is to “increase engagement.” The key results might then be “simplify user journey A” and “enhance feature alpha.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OKRs can be used to create cascading goals—goals that are systematically linked. This is done by using higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as the following example shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png\" alt=\"Sample Cascading OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16705\" width=\"666\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-300x71.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-768x183.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Cascading OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the key result “simplify user journey alpha” becomes an objective with two new key results, “remove user journey step two” and “improve performance by 10%” thereby connecting the two OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to note that OKRs were originally invented by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970ies to facilitate “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent execution</a>,” that is, to help people set hard, measurable goals and to be able to clearly determine if these have been met. And that’s exactly how I experienced OKRs when I worked at Intel in the late 1990ies.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Goals in Product Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explain in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>, setting the right goals is crucial to align stakeholders and development teams and to achieve product success. Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png\" alt=\"Cascading Product Management Goals\" class=\"wp-image-16704\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-768x476.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals. The <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">vision</a> guides the user and business goals, which are contained in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. The user and business goals help select the right product goals, which I capture on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>. A product goal, finally, helps determine the right <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision. (For a more detailed explanation of the goals above, please see my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">Leading through Shared Goals</a>,” and if you would like to learn more about goal setting in product management, then check out my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now explore how the goals in figure 2 can be captured as OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capturing Product-related Goals as OKRs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that I’d like to offer a product that helps people eat more healthily. I could then capture the goals shown in figure 2 as OKRs in the following way:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-product-mgmt-OKRs-1024x924.png\" alt=\"Sample Product Management OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16708\" width=\"729\" height=\"657\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-product-mgmt-OKRs-1024x924.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-product-mgmt-OKRs-300x271.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-product-mgmt-OKRs-768x693.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-product-mgmt-OKRs.png 1154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Sample Product-related OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three things in figure 3 above that I’d like to bring to your attention: First, the top-level OKRs describe vision and product strategy. The vision is the objective, and the product strategy is expressed by the key results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I have derived the product goal objective from the first and third key result of the top-level objective (as illustrated by the grey arrows). I have also used the first key result of the second objective to determine the third objective. This creates a set of cascading OKRs. I wasn’t able, however, to reuse higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as shown in figure 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, the second OKRs are the equivalent of the first entry on a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">goal-oriented product roadmap</a>. If you want to work with a roadmap that looks further ahead, you will have to add additional OKRs to the ones in figure 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should You Use OKRs for Your Product?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer this question, let’s consider some major benefits and drawbacks of applying OKRs in product management, starting with the positives:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Consistency: Using OKRs means that all goals adhere to the same format. This can be particularly helpful when OKRs are widely used in the organisation and the stakeholders and development team members are familiar with the method.</li><li>Validation: Coupling objectives with key results can help you tell if and when a goal has been met.</li><li>Links: Being able to use key results as new objectives is very useful, even though I was not able to take advantage of it in the sample OKRs in figure 3.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also see the following drawbacks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lack of visualisation: Using OKRs to capture goals leads to a rather text-heavy approach. This feels like turning back the clock and not taking advantage of the visual product management tools developed in recent years like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO product roadmap</a> or Alexander Osterwalder’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas\" target=\"_blank\">business model canvas</a>. These tools make it easier, though, to understand, validate, and evolve a product strategy, product roadmap, and business model respectively.</li><li>Overuse: Objectives should be significant, concrete, and action-oriented, writes John Doerr in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/024134848X/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Measure What Matters</em></a>. And <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Andy Grove</a> pointed out that key results should be “so specific that a person knows without question whether he has completed them and done it on time or not.” While you can use OKRs to capture a vision and strategy—as I did in figure 3—it seems to me like shoehorning them into a format they don’t naturally fit into. I personally find that OKRs are best used for what they were invented for: to facilitate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-strategy-cycle/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16635\">execution</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you now use OKRs? I recommend applying them if they help you set and track the relevant goals and if the they can be easily understood by the stakeholders and development teams. If you are in doubt, experiment with the goal-setting approach and see how it works for you. Make sure, though, that <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"12541\">you stay in charge of the product</a> and don&#8217;t allow powerful <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/conflict-resolution-tips-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"12806\">stakeholders</a> to dictate product OKRs to you.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/okrs-in-product-management/\">OKRs in Product Management</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"OKRs in a Nutshell\nOKRs are a method for setting and tracking goals.

And that’s exactly how I experienced OKRs when I worked at Intel in the late 1990ies.\nGoals in Product Management\nAs I explain in my book How to Lead in Product Management, setting the right goals is crucial to align stakeholders and development teams and to achieve product success. Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.\nFigure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals\n\n\n\nFigure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals. The vision guides the user and business goals, which are contained in the product strategy. The user and business goals help select the right product goals, which I capture on the product roadmap. A product goal, finally, helps determine the right sprint goals.\nAt the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision. (For a more detailed explanation of the goals above, please see my article “Leading through Shared Goals,” and if you would like to learn more about goal setting in product management, then check out my book How to Lead in Product Management.) \nLet’s now explore how the goals in figure 2 can be captured as OKRs.\nCapturing Product-related Goals as OKRs\nSay that I’d like to offer a product that helps people eat more healthily. I could then capture the goals shown in figure 2 as OKRs in the following way:\nFigure 3: Sample Product-related OKRs\n\n\n\nThere are three things in figure 3 above that I’d like to bring to your attention: First, the top-level OKRs describe vision and product strategy. The vision is the objective, and the product strategy is expressed by the key results.\nSecond, I have derived the product goal objective from the first and third key result of the top-level objective (as illustrated by the grey arrows). I have also used the first key result of the second objective to determine the third objective. This creates a set of cascading OKRs. I wasn’t able, however, to reuse higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as shown in figure 1.\nThird, the second OKRs are the equivalent of the first entry on a goal-oriented product roadmap. If you want to work with a roadmap that looks further ahead, you will have to add additional OKRs to the ones in figure 3.\nShould You Use OKRs for Your Product?\nTo answer this question, let’s consider some major benefits and drawbacks of applying OKRs in product management, starting with the positives:\nConsistency: Using OKRs means that all goals adhere to the same format. This can be particularly helpful when OKRs are widely used in the organisation and the stakeholders and development team members are familiar with the method.\nValidation: Coupling objectives with key results can help you tell if and when a goal has been met.\nLinks: Being able to use key results as new objectives is very useful, even though I was not able to take advantage of it in the sample OKRs in figure 3.\n\n\n\n\nBut I also see the following drawbacks:\nLack of visualisation: Using OKRs to capture goals leads to a rather text-heavy approach. This feels like turning back the clock and not taking advantage of the visual product management tools developed in recent years like my product vision board and GO product roadmap or Alexander Osterwalder’s business model canvas. These tools make it easier, though, to understand, validate, and evolve a product strategy, product roadmap, and business model respectively.\nOveruse: Objectives should be significant, concrete, and action-oriented, writes John Doerr in his book Measure What Matters. And Andy Grove pointed out that key results should be “so specific that a person knows without question whether he has completed them and done it on time or not.” While you can use OKRs to capture a vision and strategy—as I did in figure 3—it seems to me like shoehorning them into a format they don’t naturally fit into. I personally find that OKRs are best used for what they were invented for: to facilitate execution.\n\n\n\n\nShould you now use OKRs? I recommend applying them if they help you set and track the relevant goals and if the they can be easily understood by the stakeholders and development teams. If you are in doubt, experiment with the goal-setting approach and see how it works for you. Make sure, though, that you stay in charge of the product and don’t allow powerful stakeholders to dictate product OKRs to you.\nThe post OKRs in Product Management appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/okrs-in-product-management/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/okrs-in-product-management/\" title=\"OKRs in Product Management\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-frank-cone-2230796-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Cone\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-frank-cone-2230796-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-frank-cone-2230796-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-frank-cone-2230796-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-frank-cone-2230796-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-frank-cone-2230796.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a><p>OKRs—objectives and key results—have experienced a renewed popularity in recent years.

For example, a product manager might determine the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/ten-product-backlog-tips/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1301\">product backlog</a>, the development work, and the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10199\">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle, Process Oly\" class=\"wp-image-16650\" width=\"512\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png 896w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-300x259.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-768x663.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14245\">extend the product’s life cycle</a>, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">too big and heterogenous</a>, the value proposition might <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">not be compelling enough</a>, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\">Strategize</a></em>. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to &#8220;Product Strategy&#8221; in the picture above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goals</a></em>. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog</a>. Then create just enough <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready product backlog items</a> to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-scrum-cycle/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3854\">best suited to create a new product or a major product update</a>, I&#8217;ve added another little cycle between &#8220;Product Backlog&#8221; and &#8220;Product&#8221; on the picture above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release burndown chart</a>. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are <em>engagement</em>, <em>retention</em>, <em>product quality</em>, <em>team motivation</em>, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, <em>revenue</em> and <em>cost</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the KPIs and the development progress data to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">review the product strategy</a> and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\" target=\"_blank\">pivot</a>, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have now completed the cycle and started another one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Involve the Right People</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Systematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a> and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">development progress</a>, and updating the plans. Inviting people to contribute to strategic decisions makes it more likely that they understand and support them.  What’s more, this allows you to leverage their expertise, which makes it more likely that you will make the right decisions. If you work on a larger product and in a scaled environment, include the product people who work with you, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature owners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great way to engage the key stakeholders and development team members is to run a collaborative workshop, be it online or in the office.

For example, a product manager might determine the product strategy and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.\nBased on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the product roadmap, the product backlog, the development work, and the key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n\n\n\nIn the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to extend the product’s life cycle, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals.\nBefore you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be too big and heterogenous, the value proposition might not be compelling enough, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book Strategize. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to “Product Strategy” in the picture above.\nOnce you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes product goals. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.\nWith an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog. Then create just enough ready product backlog items to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually best suited to create a new product or a major product update, I’ve added another little cycle between “Product Backlog” and “Product” on the picture above. \nAfter development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a release burndown chart. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are engagement, retention, product quality, team motivation, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, revenue and cost.\nUse the KPIs and the development progress data to review the product strategy and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to pivot, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.\nYou have now completed the cycle and started another one.\nInvolve the Right People\nSystematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.\nTo maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the key stakeholders and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and development progress, and updating the plans. Inviting people to contribute to strategic decisions makes it more likely that they understand and support them.  What’s more, this allows you to leverage their expertise, which makes it more likely that you will make the right decisions. If you work on a larger product and in a scaled environment, include the product people who work with you, for example, the feature owners.\nA great way to engage the key stakeholders and development team members is to run a collaborative workshop, be it online or in the office. Ask your Scrum Master or another experienced facilitator to help prepare the workshop and facilitate the session. This includes establishing ground rules, selecting a helpful decision rule like consent, and ensuring that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. (You can find more advice on collaborative decision-making in my book How to Lead in Product Management.)\nInvolving the stakeholder and development team members in the decision-making process puts collaboration at the centre of the strategy cycle, as the picture below shows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n“All models are wrong, but some are useful,” as George Box once observed. Every model is an abstraction of reality. It therefore simplifies or ignores certain aspects and leaves out some details. This is also true for the process that I have described in this article.

This increases the chances of creating a product that users actually want and need and achieving product success. Carrying out product discovery involves answering the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the specific value the product should create for the users and customers? What problem should it solve, or which benefit should it create?</li><li>Which market and market segment should the product address? Who are the users and who are the customers?</li><li>What makes the product stand out? How will it differ from competing offerings?</li><li>What are its business goals? How will it benefit the company? For example, generate revenue or meet a profit margin, reduce cost, or develop the brand?</li><li>What business model will it use in order to achieve the business goals, including revenue sources, cost factors, and channels?</li><li>Will the product make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-ethics/\">positive impact on people’s lives, the wider society, and the planet, or will it at least not cause any harm</a>?</li><li>How might people use the product? What are the major touch points? What kind of user experience (UX) should the product give rise to?</li><li>How can the product be built? What architecture patterns and technologies may be used?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to answer the questions above, you may want to use techniques such as direct observation, user interviews, prototyping, creating a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">strategy canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>, and you may capture some of them using a tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a>. Whatever you do, I suggest that you follow Steve Blank’s advice and “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/\" target=\"_blank\">get out of the building</a>”. Meeting users and customers, at least in form of a video call, not only helps you validate your assumptions and develop new ideas. It also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\">empathise with the individuals</a> and to better understand their perspectives and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it helpful to distinguish two types of product discovery: timeboxed and continuous discovery. Let’s look at timeboxed product discovery first.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeboxed Product Di<strong>scovery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you create a brand-new product or when you make bigger changes to an existing one, like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\">taking it to a new market</a>, you will benefit from using a dedicated, timeboxed product discovery period. This results in an innovation process like the one shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png\" alt=\"product discovery vs product development\" class=\"wp-image-16536\" width=\"561\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-300x92.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-768x234.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development.png 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, product discovery precedes product development. The former focuses on understanding if and why a product should be created or updated. The latter largely determines how the product should be developed. This includes discovering the right UX design and functionality and making the right technical decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I have purposefully drawn discovery and development as overlapping, as I find it helpful to address major UX and technical risks as part of the discovery work—without making the mistake of using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front\" target=\"_blank\">big design upfront (BDU)</a>. Addressing these risks ensures that the development team has the right knowledge to hit the ground running <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8888\">when starting development</a>. Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> and business model,</li><li>Actionable <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a> that implements the strategy,</li><li>Initial product backlog that captures the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-lean-product-backlog-variation-and-overburden/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"591\">necessary product details</a>,</li><li>A high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\">spikes</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/discovery-and-strategizing-team-1024x489.png\" alt=\"Product Discovery Team\" class=\"wp-image-14741\" width=\"555\" height=\"262\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\">understand why the product is being created or updated</a>. The latter will <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution</a>. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision</a>, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Co</strong>ntinuous Product Discovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Review the product performance using the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\">key performance indicators</a>. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?</li><li>Look for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.</li><li>Keep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate? Job postings can help you guess your competitors’ plans. Reviewing their products will tell you <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">if your product is still sufficiently differentiated</a>.</li><li>Follow the developments at your own company: Are there any changes to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/business-strategy-and-product-strategy/\">business strategy</a>? And if so, what are the consequences for your product? </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, regularly hold <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">collaborative strategy reviews</a>, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb. Assess the product strategy and product roadmap together with development team representatives and key stakeholders. These are ideally the same people who participated in the timeboxed discovery work and who helped you create the current product strategy and roadmap. As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you manage a larger product and you work in a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\">scaled environment</a>, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature and component owners or SAFe product owners</a>, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\">A Brief Guide to Product Discovery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"What is Product Discovery?\nProduct discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why a product should be developed and offered.

Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:\nValidated product strategy and business model,\nActionable product roadmap that implements the strategy,\nInitial product backlog that captures the necessary product details,\nA high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (spikes).\n\n\n\n\nAs it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.\nTo carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, key stakeholders, and Scrum Master or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.\n\nAs the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.\nDevelopment team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and understand why the product is being created or updated. The latter will enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.\nInviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.\nThe Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book Strategize.\nContinuous Product Discovery\nAs helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.\nProduct management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.\nIt is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:\nReview the product performance using the appropriate key performance indicators. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?\nLook for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.\nKeep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate? Job postings can help you guess your competitors’ plans. Reviewing their products will tell you if your product is still sufficiently differentiated.\nFollow the developments at your own company: Are there any changes to the business strategy? And if so, what are the consequences for your product? \n\n\n\n\nTo help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:\nFirst, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.\nSecond, regularly hold collaborative strategy reviews, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb. Assess the product strategy and product roadmap together with development team representatives and key stakeholders. These are ideally the same people who participated in the timeboxed discovery work and who helped you create the current product strategy and roadmap. As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.\nA Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment\nIf you manage a larger product and you work in a scaled environment, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, feature and component owners or SAFe product owners, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.\nIn addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.\nThe post A Brief Guide to Product Discovery appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" title=\"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/clark-tibbs-oqStl2L5oxI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"something great\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>When practiced correctly, product discovery maximises the chances of achieving product success.

How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?</p><p>It’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.</p><p><strong><em>“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — </em></strong>attributed to Sengcan</p><p>One of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:</p><ul><li>No situational problem-solving questions (“<em>What would do if X happened?</em>”)</li><li>No questions about my past roles (<em>“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”</em>)</li><li>No technical questions</li><li><em>Only</em> questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.</li></ul><p>I thought this was a fascinating interesting technique.

The individual looked at me slightly bewildered and replied, &#8220;I can’t. They are all high-priority.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritisation requires deciding how important an item is. If everything is high priority, everything is equally important. This means in effect that nothing is a priority. But without clear priorities, the development team lacks direction, and there is only a slim chance of creating a successful product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common root cause of not being able to prioritise a product backlog is a lack of understanding of who the users of the product are and what specific value it should create for them. I find it not uncommon that features are added to the product backlog because a senior <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholder</a> demands it (HIPPO syndrome) or someone thinks it is a good idea (“let’s brainstorm some <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a>”). But <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> exists to generate value for the users and for the company providing it. If it is not clear who the users are and why they would want to interact with the product, it will be hard to decide which items should be in the product backlog and how important they are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate the risk of adding the wrong items to the product backlog, ensure that you have a validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> in place, no matter if you look after a brand-new or as an existing product. Such a strategy should clearly state the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The users and customers of the product so that it is clear who will benefit from it and who won’t;</li><li>The main problem the product should address or the primary benefit it should offer, or the main goal users will want to achieve with it;</li><li>The three to five features that will make it stand out from the crowd;</li><li>The specific benefits it should create for the business.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at a brief example and say that I want to create a product that helps people eat healthily. Then I could choose to address middle aged men who suffer from unhealthy eating habits and who don’t exercise enough. The benefit might be to reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The standout features might be to measure food sugar levels, analyse the user’s eating habits, and integrate with leading smart scales. The business goals, finally, might be to diversify my company and open up a new revenue stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you should be confident that your strategy is correct, and you should have data to support your view. In other words, you should have addressed the key assumptions and risks in the product strategy, and you should have carried out the necessary validation work. A tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a> helps you capture and validate your product strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Describe the outcome or benefit the product should create in the next few months</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a product strategy in place is great, but it is not enough to effectively prioritise a product backlog. What’s required is a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\">product goal</a> that is connected to the strategy and creates the right context to decide which backlog items are more important and which ones are less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create such a goal, ask yourself which outcome or benefit your product should achieve in the next, say, three to six months. What are the desired user and business benefits you want to create? Make sure that this goal is in line with the product strategy and that it helps create the desired user and business benefits. An example based on the sample strategy above would be &#8220;help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.&#8221; (Note that I have chosen a compound goal that captures the desired user and business benefits.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to take this idea further, derive several product goals from the product strategy for the next 12 months, and capture them on a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a>. This puts the goal chosen in context and communicates how the product is likely to evolve over a longer period. If you have a product roadmap, then ensure that it implements the overall product strategy. Consider reworking it so that it clearly states the desired outcomes your product should achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Remove all items from the product backlog that do not support the desired outcome</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, use the product goal you have chosen to delete all items from the product backlog that do not serve it. While this approach might sound radical, it ensures that your backlog becomes concise and focused. It avoids having items on the backlog that are speculative and may not create value, and maybe even more importantly, it facilitates prioritisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe that removing the product backlog items is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, then this may indicate that you lack the necessary <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">empowerment</a> and/or that the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\">stakeholders</a> do not buy into the overall product strategy and the specific product goal you have chosen. Involving the individuals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">decision-making process</a> can help address both issues. This allows the stakeholders to voice their ideas and concerns, and it makes it more likely that they understand and support important product decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to decide together with the stakeholders, then invite them to a meeting. Carefully prepare the session and choose a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule</a>, for instance, consent. Additionally, ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or another skilled facilitator to help run the meeting so that everyone is heard, and nobody dominates. (I offer more advice on securing stakeholder buy-in and decision-making in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Prioritise the remaining product backlog items</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now prioritise the remaining product backlog items.

The individual looked at me slightly bewildered and replied, “I can’t. They are all high-priority.” \nPrioritisation requires deciding how important an item is. If everything is high priority, everything is equally important. This means in effect that nothing is a priority. But without clear priorities, the development team lacks direction, and there is only a slim chance of creating a successful product.\nA common root cause of not being able to prioritise a product backlog is a lack of understanding of who the users of the product are and what specific value it should create for them. I find it not uncommon that features are added to the product backlog because a senior stakeholder demands it (HIPPO syndrome) or someone thinks it is a good idea (“let’s brainstorm some user stories”). But a product exists to generate value for the users and for the company providing it. If it is not clear who the users are and why they would want to interact with the product, it will be hard to decide which items should be in the product backlog and how important they are. \nTo mitigate the risk of adding the wrong items to the product backlog, ensure that you have a validated product strategy in place, no matter if you look after a brand-new or as an existing product. Such a strategy should clearly state the following:\nThe users and customers of the product so that it is clear who will benefit from it and who won’t;\nThe main problem the product should address or the primary benefit it should offer, or the main goal users will want to achieve with it;\nThe three to five features that will make it stand out from the crowd;\nThe specific benefits it should create for the business.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at a brief example and say that I want to create a product that helps people eat healthily. Then I could choose to address middle aged men who suffer from unhealthy eating habits and who don’t exercise enough. The benefit might be to reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The standout features might be to measure food sugar levels, analyse the user’s eating habits, and integrate with leading smart scales. The business goals, finally, might be to diversify my company and open up a new revenue stream.\nAdditionally, you should be confident that your strategy is correct, and you should have data to support your view. In other words, you should have addressed the key assumptions and risks in the product strategy, and you should have carried out the necessary validation work. A tool like my product vision board helps you capture and validate your product strategy.\nStep 2: Describe the outcome or benefit the product should create in the next few months\nHaving a product strategy in place is great, but it is not enough to effectively prioritise a product backlog. What’s required is a specific product goal that is connected to the strategy and creates the right context to decide which backlog items are more important and which ones are less.\nTo create such a goal, ask yourself which outcome or benefit your product should achieve in the next, say, three to six months. What are the desired user and business benefits you want to create? Make sure that this goal is in line with the product strategy and that it helps create the desired user and business benefits. An example based on the sample strategy above would be “help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” (Note that I have chosen a compound goal that captures the desired user and business benefits.)\nI like to take this idea further, derive several product goals from the product strategy for the next 12 months, and capture them on a product roadmap. This puts the goal chosen in context and communicates how the product is likely to evolve over a longer period. If you have a product roadmap, then ensure that it implements the overall product strategy. Consider reworking it so that it clearly states the desired outcomes your product should achieve.\nStep 3: Remove all items from the product backlog that do not support the desired outcome\nNext, use the product goal you have chosen to delete all items from the product backlog that do not serve it. While this approach might sound radical, it ensures that your backlog becomes concise and focused. It avoids having items on the backlog that are speculative and may not create value, and maybe even more importantly, it facilitates prioritisation.\nIf you believe that removing the product backlog items is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, then this may indicate that you lack the necessary empowerment and/or that the stakeholders do not buy into the overall product strategy and the specific product goal you have chosen. Involving the individuals in the decision-making process can help address both issues. This allows the stakeholders to voice their ideas and concerns, and it makes it more likely that they understand and support important product decisions. \nIf you plan to decide together with the stakeholders, then invite them to a meeting. Carefully prepare the session and choose a decision rule, for instance, consent. Additionally, ask your Scrum Master or another skilled facilitator to help run the meeting so that everyone is heard, and nobody dominates. (I offer more advice on securing stakeholder buy-in and decision-making in my book How to Lead in Product Management.)\nStep 4: Prioritise the remaining product backlog items\nNow prioritise the remaining product backlog items. I recommend that you prioritise a new or significantly changed product backlog initially by risk, taking into account the user, technology, and business-related risks. Assess all backlog items together with the development team and move those to the top that carry the highest risk. This approach accelerates learning and it avoids failing late when there are less options to change course. \nFinally, ensure that the high-priority items are “ready“, that the development team and you have a shared understanding of them, that the team can implement them in the next sprint, and that they are testable.\nThe Moral of the Story\nYou might be wondering what was up with the healthcare product I mentioned earlier. The prioritisation difficulties were indeed rooted in the lack of a clear and agreed product strategy and the absence of a clear, focused goal for the initial version. Consequently, the offering launched was more like a maximum viable product than a minimum one. Unsurprisingly, it pretty much bombed, which resulted in the company losing significant market share and people leaving the enterprise. \nAs this story shows, it is crucial to have an overall product strategy in place before you decide which functionality your product should offer and in which order it should be implemented. In other words, make sure that you create an effective product strategy first before you worry about the product details and that you systematically connect the product backlog to the strategy.\nThe post Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/\" title=\"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrishna-flickr-e1590504925764-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ducks in a row\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>The product backlog is an essential product management tool: It captures detailed product decisions and directs the work of the development team.

Think of the vision as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html\" target=\"_blank\">big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)</a> that inspires people and offers a continuity of purpose for the next five to ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\">8 Tips for Creating A Compelling Product Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Target Group is (too) Big and Heterogenous</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Everyone who owns a smartphone”, “Business users and consumers”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A very big and diverse target group makes it hard to formulate a crisp, compelling value proposition and strong standout features. It can also result in a large product backlog and high development cost: The greater the number of people who should benefit from your product is, the more diverse their needs are likely to be, and the more features are usually required to address them. Trying to offer a product that pleases everybody carries the risk of not doing a good job for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: A lack of understanding of users and their needs, lack of empowerment of the person in charge of the product, inappropriate growth strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Successful products are not built by agreeing on the smallest common denominator or trying to please powerful stakeholders. Instead, they require tough strategic decision and clear focus. Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank suggested</a>, particularly when you manage a new or young product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams</a>: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/market-segmentation-tips-for-product-managers/\">Market Segmentation Tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 59; <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 36.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor. Consequently, it will be hard to achieve the desired business benefits and monetise the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of understanding what problems users really face and what they really need; a target group that is too large and heterogenous, as discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the main reason for people to use the product, the primary benefit that the product should offer to the users or the main problem it should address. Another approach is to identify the main goal users will want to achieve by using the product or to find the primary job the product should do for them. Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order get to know the users, empathise with the individuals, and develop a thorough understanding of their needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 94, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs are Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy to use, calorie counter, works on iOS and Android”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When features—in the sense of product capabilities—are mistaken for needs, it is not clear why people should use the product, and the offering is likely to suffer from having a poor, unconvincing value proposition. Additionally, there is too much focus on the solution (“solutionising”), which is likely to limit the development team’s ability to come up with the best possible design and architecture options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Confusion about what a need is; a lack of understanding of the user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the <em>why</em>: Ask why people would want to use the product. What specific benefit will it offer, or which problem will it help solve? Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews.

Iterate over the product vision board and refine its contents, similar to how you would refine the product backlog and break bigger items into more specific ones. For instance, if getting fit is the desired benefit, then a refined and more specific needs statement might be “be able to run 10k”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 66.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>No Convincing Standout Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy-to-use user interface, calorie intake, barcode scanner”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Standout features ensure that your product is effectively differentiated: As their name suggests, they make your product stand out from the crowd, they give people a reason to choose it over competing offerings. If the features are weak, it will not be clear to prospective users why they should favour your product over alternatives, and it will be hard to market and sell the offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of market insight, lack of empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: To address the first cause, perform competitor research and apply a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">Strategy Canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>.

What are the specific benefits that the product will generate for the business? And which one is the most important one? Then take the next step: Consider how the product will be monetised and explore its underlying business model. Iterate over the business goals until they become clear and specific. For instance, make the goal &#8220;be the number one weight loss app&#8221; precise by describing the desired business impact, the specific benefit the company will experience, such as increase in brand equity.

Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as Steve Blank suggested, particularly when you manage a new or young product. \nAfter your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.\nAdditionally, strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.\nMore Information: Market Segmentation Tips and Strategize, pp. 59; Boost Your Product Leadership Power and How to Lead in Product Management, pp. 36.\nMany Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product\nExamples: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”\nProblem: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor. Consequently, it will be hard to achieve the desired business benefits and monetise the product.\nCauses: Lack of understanding what problems users really face and what they really need; a target group that is too large and heterogenous, as discussed above.\nSolution: Focus on the main reason for people to use the product, the primary benefit that the product should offer to the users or the main problem it should address. Another approach is to identify the main goal users will want to achieve by using the product or to find the primary job the product should do for them. Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order get to know the users, empathise with the individuals, and develop a thorough understanding of their needs. \nMore Information: Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users, Strategize, pp. 94, How to Lead in Product Management, pp. 9.\nNeeds are Features\nExamples: “Easy to use, calorie counter, works on iOS and Android”\nProblem: When features—in the sense of product capabilities—are mistaken for needs, it is not clear why people should use the product, and the offering is likely to suffer from having a poor, unconvincing value proposition. Additionally, there is too much focus on the solution (“solutionising”), which is likely to limit the development team’s ability to come up with the best possible design and architecture options.\nCauses: Confusion about what a need is; a lack of understanding of the user needs.\nSolution: Focus on the why: Ask why people would want to use the product. What specific benefit will it offer, or which problem will it help solve? Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews. Additionally, describe the needs from the users’ perspective, for example, “help me achieve a healthy target weight” or “help me significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes”.\nMore Information: Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users, What is a Digital Product: Section “Features and Components”.\nNeeds Statement is not Specific Enough\nExamples: “Get fit”, “Feel better”, “Improve eating habits”\nProblem: It’s perfectly fine to start out with a broad needs statement. But if you don’t refine it, it will be hard to effectively address any assumptions and risks it may contain and to choose the right validation techniques. Additionally, it will be difficult to select the right customer key performance indicators (KPIs), collect the relevant data, and understand if the product is creating enough value for the users, and if the strategy is working.\nCauses: Lack of understanding of the users and their needs; needs section has not been sufficiently refined.\nSolution: Carry out (additional) qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order to discover the specific reason for people to use your product. Iterate over the product vision board and refine its contents, similar to how you would refine the product backlog and break bigger items into more specific ones. For instance, if getting fit is the desired benefit, then a refined and more specific needs statement might be “be able to run 10k”.\nMore Information: Strategize, pp. 66.\nNo Convincing Standout Features\nExamples: “Easy-to-use user interface, calorie intake, barcode scanner”\nProblem: Standout features ensure that your product is effectively differentiated: As their name suggests, they make your product stand out from the crowd, they give people a reason to choose it over competing offerings. If the features are weak, it will not be clear to prospective users why they should favour your product over alternatives, and it will be hard to market and sell the offering.\nCauses: Lack of market insight, lack of empowerment.\nSolution: To address the first cause, perform competitor research and apply a tool like the Strategy Canvas or E-R-R-C grid. To resolve the second cause and mitigate the risk of making compromises and possibly creating a feature soup, a loose collection of features that tries to please the powerful stakeholders, explore how you can increase your authority and align the stakeholders. \nWork on your referent power and expertise, and lobby for management support. Additionally, involve the stakeholders in creating the product vision board but do not allow individuals to dominate and force their ideas onto the group. Ask your Scrum Master to help you select the right decision rule and to facilitate joint meetings.\nMore Information: Make Your Product Stand Out with the Strategy Canvas, Eliminate Features to Differentiate your Product, and Strategize, pp. 68; Boost Your Product Leadership Power and How to Lead in Product Management, pp. 36.\nNo Clear Business Goals\nExamples: “Make money, help the company grow, be the number one weight loss app”\nProblem: When your product strategy lacks clear, specific business goals, it will be difficult to tell if the product creates enough value for the business, and it will be difficult to select the right financial KPIs and understand if the product strategy is working.\nCauses: Business needs are not clear or understood; business goal section on the product vision board has not been sufficiently refined.\nSolution: Explore why it is worthwhile for your company to invest in the product. What are the specific benefits that the product will generate for the business? And which one is the most important one? Then take the next step: Consider how the product will be monetised and explore its underlying business model. Iterate over the business goals until they become clear and specific. For instance, make the goal “be the number one weight loss app” precise by describing the desired business impact, the specific benefit the company will experience, such as increase in brand equity. Finally, make the business goals measurable. For example, state how much money you believe the product will make or by how much brand equity will increase over a specific timeframe, using a ratio or range.\nMore Information: Why Product People Should Care About Business Strategy, Strategize, pp. 39.\nProduct Vision Board is Not Testable\nExamples: See the examples of the pitfalls above.\nProblem: As long as the bottom sections of your product vision board contain statements that are unclear or unspecific, it will be hard to spot all leap-of-faith assumptions and key risks. Consequently, it will be difficult to test the board and mitigate the risk that the product strategy is wrong. In the worst case, you end up pursuing a clever sounding but poorly validated strategy that results in painful product failure.\nCause: The product vision board is not sufficiently refined and requires more work\nSolution: Iterate over the product vision board contents until each strategy-related statement can be tested and shown to be valid or invalid. If that’s not possible, stop and carry out just enough market and user research to be able to create a testable board. Then start the validation work by choosing the biggest risk and address it, for example, by observing users or building a prototype.\nMore Information: Product Discovery Tips, Working with the Product Vision Board, Strategize, pp. 86.\nThe post Common Product Vision Board Mistakes appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/#respond","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" title=\"Common Product Vision Board Mistakes\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a-man-in-red-shirt-covering-his-face-3760043-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Mistake\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>The product vision board is a simple yet powerful tool to capture the product vision and the product strategy.

And what ticks you off?</h4><p>👋 <em>Hi! I’m Julie Zhuo. I </em><a href=\"http://inspirit.work/\"><em>help companies scale and build</em></a><em> people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567\"><em>popular management book</em></a><em>. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. </em><strong><em>The Looking Glass</em></strong><em> is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5_Xv5q_WfIXdhkIN.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Once upon a time, I received an important email in my inbox that alerted me to some distressing news.</p><p>Every six months, our company ran a wide-scale anonymous satisfaction survey that pretty much every single employee answered. If your team was big enough, you’d get your own breakout of the results for how your immediate team was feeling. I always looked forward to diving in and seeing what was going well and what wasn’t.</p><p>As my eyes scanned the various questions, graphs, and answers, one result in particular stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>Under the question “How often does your manager show care for you?” the chart that displayed the responses from my team was a mass of red. I had to read it a few times to ensure I wasn’t misunderstanding: <em>the majority of my team thought I didn’t show care for them?!</em></p><p>This was hard to process because of course I cared. I cared a lot! I took pride in helping my reports grow and thrive. I gave them challenging projects and frequent feedback because I wanted to see them succeed. And if there were ways in which I could help them — by hiring for their team, advocating for issues on their behalf, or pitching in on a tough project — I always showed up. How could they possibly think that I didn’t care?!</p><p>That night, I met a manager friend for dinner and poured my heart out to him. He listened and then gave me a diagnosis. “Julie,” he said, “Have you ever told your reports that you care about them? Or asked them how they’d like to be cared for?”</p><p>I searched my memories and came up short. He had a point. “Everyone’s wired differently,” he said. “So sometimes we struggle to understand each other. Maybe the way you show care and the way your reports perceive care are different. Everyone has their own preferences for how they like to operate and be treated.”</p><p>He was absolutely right. I took the feedback to better understand what “being cared for” meant to my reports. And I would learn this lesson time and time again — that even if you’re a good, experienced manager, even if you show up to work every day with confidence, you’re still going to fail to connect with others from time to time. You’ll still have misunderstandings or talk past each other.</p><p>Some of this will be due to cultural differences, or contrasting personalities, or because we simply have different perspectives and life experiences. Whatever the source, the more I understood about what mattered to my the people I worked with, the better of a colleague and manager I’d be. Similarly, the more my colleagues understood about how <em>I</em> worked, the fewer misunderstandings we’d have.</p><p>That’s where the exercise of creating a user manual comes in.</p><h4>A User Guide for You</h4><p>I started writing a “How to work with Julie” guide for my team about three or four years ago, and heard the phrase <em>User Guide</em> some time later. Instantly it stuck with me. When you buy a new camera, it comes with a little booklet that teaches you about the specifics of the gadget — what each button means, how to select the appropriate lighting, how to review the images.</p><p>A User Guide for a Person works in a similar way. It creates clarity on how you work — what you value, how you look at problems, what your blind spots or areas of growth are, and how to build trust with you.</p><p>It’s something you can give to your manager, the folks you work the closest with, or — if you are a manager — every new report who joins your team.</p><p>The key to a good User Guide is to make it as <em>specific to you as possible</em> (<a href=\"https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-candidates-companies\">check out this post on why that matters</a>). Leave out the generic fluff that everyone would agree with, like “<em>I get motivated when my work has impact.</em>” That doesn’t tell us anything, except that you’re not a cat. Can you be more specific and tell us what <em>kind</em> of impact is motivating to you (and what kind isn’t?)</p><p>The most effective User Guides contain snippets that might make you feel vulnerable, like you’re letting the team see you unplugged, in your PJs with rumpled hair. But vulnerability is the secret ingredient to trust. When you acknowledge your imperfections, you will receive far more rewards in the form of support, mentorship, and empathy. And you invite others to be more open with you as well.</p><p>I’ve included a User Guide template and my personal example as a starting point — feel free to modify to best suit your needs. Mine has been a living document over the years, honed through continual feedback that has shined new light on how I understand myself and my relationships. I hope yours gives you a similar gift.</p><p>Happy team-working!</p><h4><strong>Template: A User Guide To Working With &lt;Your Name&gt;</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://coda.io/@joulee/meet-julie\"><em>Use this template on Coda.io</em></a></p><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p><em>Why are you writing this user guide?

What can others expect in receiving feedback from you? How would you prefer to receive feedback from others?</p><h4><strong>Sample: A User Guide To Working With Julie Zhuo</strong></h4><p>I’m delighted to be working with you! And I’m excited for all we’ll learn from each other! I already have high expectations that our collaboration together will yield some wonderful things :) That said, we are unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences and styles for how we like to work.</p><p>I’m writing this user guide to give you a better handle on me and my values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible. I encourage you to do the same and share your user guide with me as well!</p><h4><strong>How I view success</strong></h4><ul><li>A manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for her team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are people — hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; purpose — clarity on what success looks like; and process — clarity on how to best work. Of these three levers, I believe people is the most important.</li><li>Success is constantly learning and getting better. We can’t always control the results, and if we aim high we will sometimes fail. But no matter the outcome, there are always lessons to be mined. Those learnings are ours to keep forever.</li><li>The path to success matters as much as the outcome. Everyone gets lucky and unlucky sometimes. But if we’re good, our success will be sustainable because it’s our process that works.</li><li>It’s better to set ambitious goals that we don’t always meet, than to sell ourselves short.</li><li>We can always do and be better.</li><li>Success without integrity is like a car without an engine.</li></ul><h4><strong>How I communicate</strong></h4><ul><li>I am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk my thoughts out loud which can feel rambling. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or to be precise with action items.</li><li>Because a lot of my job is nurturing creativity, my preference is for others to come to the right solution with their own conviction, not to tell others what I think the right solution is. However, I recognize that sometimes the most pragmatic and efficient thing is to be clear with my opinion early on so we can resolve major misalignments. If I am not being clear and you worry we may not be seeing eye to eye, please let me know.</li><li>I like to be engaged in conversations and presentations and show respect to the speaker. I will often smile and nod along to encourage the speaker. It doesn’t mean I agree with everything that is being said.</li><li>I am continually working on being more direct, especially about concerns or things I don’t think are going well. I commit to giving you frequent feedback or suggestions that I think may help you. If it doesn’t feel like I am being direct enough, or if my feedback is not helpful, please let me know.</li><li>I place a lot of value on having a clear big-picture narrative and being able to to speak to the meaning behind the work, as well as what’s exciting about it. If you aren’t sure why we are working on something, please let me know.</li><li>I prefer email for asynchronous team communication. Please use email if you’re describing an issue with a good deal with context. I respond to most things within 2 work days, so if I’ve been slow, re-ping me as I do sometimes miss things. If something is urgent or easy to respond to, feel free to message me over chat, and allow me the rest of the day to respond.</li><li>If you feel something is better discussed with me in person, don’t hesitate to drop a note with what you’d like to talk about. If you are a direct report, I will try my best to move things around so we can meet as soon as possible — it’s extremely important to me that you feel you always have time when you need it. If you are not a direct report but I can be of help to you, then we’ll schedule time during the next available office hours block. Occasionally, I’ll lack the necessary context to be useful, and in those cases I will decline the meeting and suggest another person who would be better able to assist you.</li></ul><h4><strong>Things I do that may annoy you</strong></h4><ul><li>I am that archetype of the “high expectations Asian parent,” so I can seem demanding, critical, and never satisfied rather than supportive, encouraging, or empathetic. Since then, I’ve come to learn that different people respond better to different styles. Please know that I am always in your corner, and I care about you, even as I work on showing that better.</li><li>I am on the hyper-rational end of the emotional spectrum. This can be annoying when you share a problem or feeling with me, and I respond with a bunch of rationalized suggestions, when what the situation called for was listening and empathy. I am working on being better attuned to this.</li><li>I am generally more focused on inputs than outputs. This means that if there is a positive outcome, but the process in getting there didn’t seem sound or intentional to me, I might not see it as cause for celebration. This can be frustrating if you are more focused on outputs than inputs.</li><li>I am frequently late to meetings, like 1–5 minutes late. Sometimes there is a good reason, but 80% of the time, the reason is that I suck at punctuality, and need to get better at it. You should call me out when this happens.</li><li>I can fall into the bias of assuming everyone has the same context as I do, and as a result, not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly or as broadly as I should. Please remind me to provide more context if I do this.</li><li>Being a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics quickly, or who want to commit to plans and not change them.</li><li>Because I have a tendency to think long-term, I might give you impractical or complex suggestions when what you’re looking for is pragmatic, short-term options. Please remind me of the problem context if you feel my feedback is unhelpful or if you observe that I am trying to boil the ocean.</li><li>I’m optimistic and see the best in others, and sometimes that may strike you as naive or unrealistic when I’m convinced a tough situation can be fixed with greater effort versus a structural change.</li></ul><h4><strong>What gains and loses my trust</strong></h4><ul><li>The easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback — whether about a piece of design work, a project proposal, or their own behavior — and use it to improve. Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.</li><li>Another thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.</li><li>I appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.</li><li>I build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.</li><li>If you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.</li><li>If I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.</li><li>It’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.</li></ul><h4><strong>My strengths</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Strong relationships</strong>. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.</li><li><strong>Staying calm, collected, and optimistic</strong>. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong>. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.</li><li><strong>Thoughtful intentionality</strong>: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.</li></ul><h4><strong>My growth areas</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Directness and simplicity in communication</strong>: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.</li><li><strong>Execution/follow-through</strong>: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.</li><li><strong>Meta-prioritization</strong>: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.</li><li><strong>Expanding domains of knowledge</strong>: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.</li><li><strong>Storytelling</strong>: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.</li></ul><p><em>Image by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/miemo/\"><em>Miemo Penttinen</em></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b8ee547a79e9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","content:encodedSnippet":"What makes you tick?

It creates clarity on how you work — what you value, how you look at problems, what your blind spots or areas of growth are, and how to build trust with you.\nIt’s something you can give to your manager, the folks you work the closest with, or — if you are a manager — every new report who joins your team.\nThe key to a good User Guide is to make it as specific to you as possible (check out this post on why that matters). Leave out the generic fluff that everyone would agree with, like “I get motivated when my work has impact.” That doesn’t tell us anything, except that you’re not a cat. Can you be more specific and tell us what kind of impact is motivating to you (and what kind isn’t?)\nThe most effective User Guides contain snippets that might make you feel vulnerable, like you’re letting the team see you unplugged, in your PJs with rumpled hair. But vulnerability is the secret ingredient to trust. When you acknowledge your imperfections, you will receive far more rewards in the form of support, mentorship, and empathy. And you invite others to be more open with you as well.\nI’ve included a User Guide template and my personal example as a starting point — feel free to modify to best suit your needs. Mine has been a living document over the years, honed through continual feedback that has shined new light on how I understand myself and my relationships. I hope yours gives you a similar gift.\nHappy team-working!\nTemplate: A User Guide To Working With <Your Name>\nUse this template on Coda.io\nIntroduction\nWhy are you writing this user guide?

And I’m excited for all we’ll learn from each other! I already have high expectations that our collaboration together will yield some wonderful things :) That said, we are unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences and styles for how we like to work.\nI’m writing this user guide to give you a better handle on me and my values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible. I encourage you to do the same and share your user guide with me as well!\nHow I view success\n\nA manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for her team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are people — hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; purpose — clarity on what success looks like; and process — clarity on how to best work. Of these three levers, I believe people is the most important.\nSuccess is constantly learning and getting better. We can’t always control the results, and if we aim high we will sometimes fail. But no matter the outcome, there are always lessons to be mined. Those learnings are ours to keep forever.\nThe path to success matters as much as the outcome. Everyone gets lucky and unlucky sometimes. But if we’re good, our success will be sustainable because it’s our process that works.\nIt’s better to set ambitious goals that we don’t always meet, than to sell ourselves short.\nWe can always do and be better.\nSuccess without integrity is like a car without an engine.\n\nHow I communicate\n\nI am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk my thoughts out loud which can feel rambling. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or to be precise with action items.\nBecause a lot of my job is nurturing creativity, my preference is for others to come to the right solution with their own conviction, not to tell others what I think the right solution is. However, I recognize that sometimes the most pragmatic and efficient thing is to be clear with my opinion early on so we can resolve major misalignments. If I am not being clear and you worry we may not be seeing eye to eye, please let me know.\nI like to be engaged in conversations and presentations and show respect to the speaker. I will often smile and nod along to encourage the speaker. It doesn’t mean I agree with everything that is being said.\nI am continually working on being more direct, especially about concerns or things I don’t think are going well. I commit to giving you frequent feedback or suggestions that I think may help you. If it doesn’t feel like I am being direct enough, or if my feedback is not helpful, please let me know.\nI place a lot of value on having a clear big-picture narrative and being able to to speak to the meaning behind the work, as well as what’s exciting about it. If you aren’t sure why we are working on something, please let me know.\nI prefer email for asynchronous team communication. Please use email if you’re describing an issue with a good deal with context. I respond to most things within 2 work days, so if I’ve been slow, re-ping me as I do sometimes miss things. If something is urgent or easy to respond to, feel free to message me over chat, and allow me the rest of the day to respond.\nIf you feel something is better discussed with me in person, don’t hesitate to drop a note with what you’d like to talk about. If you are a direct report, I will try my best to move things around so we can meet as soon as possible — it’s extremely important to me that you feel you always have time when you need it. If you are not a direct report but I can be of help to you, then we’ll schedule time during the next available office hours block. Occasionally, I’ll lack the necessary context to be useful, and in those cases I will decline the meeting and suggest another person who would be better able to assist you.\n\nThings I do that may annoy you\n\nI am that archetype of the “high expectations Asian parent,” so I can seem demanding, critical, and never satisfied rather than supportive, encouraging, or empathetic. Since then, I’ve come to learn that different people respond better to different styles. Please know that I am always in your corner, and I care about you, even as I work on showing that better.\nI am on the hyper-rational end of the emotional spectrum. This can be annoying when you share a problem or feeling with me, and I respond with a bunch of rationalized suggestions, when what the situation called for was listening and empathy. I am working on being better attuned to this.\nI am generally more focused on inputs than outputs. This means that if there is a positive outcome, but the process in getting there didn’t seem sound or intentional to me, I might not see it as cause for celebration. This can be frustrating if you are more focused on outputs than inputs.\nI am frequently late to meetings, like 1–5 minutes late. Sometimes there is a good reason, but 80% of the time, the reason is that I suck at punctuality, and need to get better at it. You should call me out when this happens.\nI can fall into the bias of assuming everyone has the same context as I do, and as a result, not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly or as broadly as I should. Please remind me to provide more context if I do this.\nBeing a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics quickly, or who want to commit to plans and not change them.\nBecause I have a tendency to think long-term, I might give you impractical or complex suggestions when what you’re looking for is pragmatic, short-term options. Please remind me of the problem context if you feel my feedback is unhelpful or if you observe that I am trying to boil the ocean.\nI’m optimistic and see the best in others, and sometimes that may strike you as naive or unrealistic when I’m convinced a tough situation can be fixed with greater effort versus a structural change.\n\nWhat gains and loses my trust\n\nThe easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback — whether about a piece of design work, a project proposal, or their own behavior — and use it to improve. Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.\nAnother thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.\nI appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.\nI build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.\nIf you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.\nIf I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.\nIt’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.\n\nMy strengths\n\nStrong relationships. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.\nStaying calm, collected, and optimistic. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.\nLong-term focus. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.\nThoughtful intentionality: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.\n\nMy growth areas\n\nDirectness and simplicity in communication: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.\nExecution/follow-through: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.\nMeta-prioritization: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.\nExpanding domains of knowledge: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.\nStorytelling: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.\n\nImage by Miemo Penttinen","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/b8ee547a79e9","isoDate":"2020-08-07T14:30:36.000Z"},{"creator":"Julie Zhuo","title":"Seven Reminders about Racism","link":"https://joulee.medium.com/seven-reminders-about-racism-b1b3e20d018?source=rss-b8a4e5ae7490------2","pubDate":"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 14:30:43 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person.

But this cost is astronomically high: we’ve been living under a veil of ignorance that whispers: <em>“Good” people (such as ourselves!) are not racists</em>. Therefore, we don’t talk about racism. We don’t talk about racism <em>so much</em> that it feels uncomfortable to bring up race up at all. But you can’t fix a problem if you don’t talk about it.</li><li>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person. It means you’ve said or done things that perpetuate systems benefitting certain races — <em>your race</em> — at the expense of others.

If you are Person C seeking to be a neutral mediator, you may think that both sides make reasonable points and could stand to improve by listening to the other. That seems fair, right? Well, only if Person B and Person A are in relatively equal positions of power. However, if they are not, <em>the person with greater power in the scenario holds greater responsibility to resolve (rather than escalate) the conflict.</em> If tensions escalate between a manager and her report, who would you expect to stay calm and collected?

We tend to think of ourselves as “normal people,” “human, just like everyone else.” This is not wrong. None of us are exempt from joy, suffering, pain, fear, self-loathing, and the entire spectrum of the human condition. We all have moments when we feel trapped or suffocated by those who hold power over us. At the same time, <em>all</em> of us will be in contexts where we have more power than someone else. Some folks are in that position far more often due to the color of their skin (whiter), their gender (male), or their economic status (wealthier).

Black and Brown people have felt this lack for a long, long time. It started 400 years ago when they were enslaved, killed and treated as “less than” human. This lack continues today. Compared to a White or Asian person, it’s harder for them to be trusted, to be hired, to borrow money, to be believed, to be celebrated, to be in positions of power, or to be seen.

Thank them because feedback is a gift that will make your future self better. Apologize because you choose to believe people when they tell you they are hurt. Apologize even if your intentions were good, because good intentions don’t negate the negative impact of your actions.

A strong network can help you access unique opportunities, and offer advice to help you grow and handle challenging situations. Yet, many people — especially introverts — struggle with networking because they feel they lack the mental energy, time, or know-how. They sometimes have the perception that networking requires meeting more people than they can handle, or that the people they want to connect with are inaccessible.\nOver time, I’ve learned to overcome those challenges and grow my own network in a way that is effective and feels authentic to me. Many friends and coworkers have asked me to share my approach, which relies on the principles below. These four principles will increase the likelihood that you create fruitful, long-term relationships with new people, and require a relatively low amount of effort.\n1.

Once a new contact interacts with you, even with a short email, you have a foot in the door and can build a relationship from there.\n2. Be consistent and gradual\nPick a cadence to regularly reach out to a new contact based on the person’s availability — e.g. monthly or quarterly. After two or three interactions, new contacts will expect you to continue reaching out and will start seeing the interactions as the start of a relationship.

Within the first two weeks of our course, nine students dropped out or were asked to leave the program because they did not demonstrate the level of commitment required for the course.
