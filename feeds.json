It’s getting inside your interviewer’s mind, and understanding <em>why</em> they’re asking you these questions, and <em>what</em> they want to know.</p><h3>The Most Common Product Management Interview Questions</h3><ol><li><strong>What do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?</strong></li><li><strong>How do you stay user-focused?</strong></li><li><strong>What main changes would you make to [our product]?</strong></li><li><strong>How do you see your career developing in the next 5 years?</strong></li><li><strong>Tell us about a time you used data to influence an important stakeholder.</strong></li><li><strong>Tell us about a time you faced failure and how you bounced back.</strong></li><li><strong>What are your main strengths and weaknesses?</strong></li><li><strong>What’s your approach to prioritizing tasks?</strong></li><li><strong>Why do you want to work at [our company]?</strong></li><li><strong>Why do you want to be/what do you love about being a Product Manager?</strong></li></ol><h3>Behind the Questions…</h3><h3>1. What do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Product Management is not a well-defined role across company lines. Each organization has a slightly different approach to development, and so they have a different view of Product Management and its role.</p><p>On top of that, each individual Product Manager builds their craft in a slightly different way. You might start out doing PM one way at the start of your career, and then have developed a completely different set of frameworks and techniques by the end.</p><p>An interviewer will ask you your approaches to PM, and how you see the role’s place within development, to make sure that you’re on the same wavelength.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>Every interview takes place on the basis that there is a need to be filled within a company, and the interviewee has the potential to fill that need. When you’re asked ‘what do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?’, the interviewer wants to know that you both see that need in the same way.</p><p>They want to know what you see as a PMs main responsibilities, the level of authority they have, and how far the buck stops with the PM in your opinion. If in doubt, quote the old PM adage… “with great responsibility, comes no power.”</p><h3>2. How do you stay user-focused?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Most companies, especially product-led companies, pride themselves on being customer-obsessed. As a Product Manager, you’re expected to be the voice of the customer, and to hold the most customer knowledge. No pressure, but how user-focused development is sort of depends on how user-focused <em>you</em> are.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>The most important thing they want to know is that you <em>are</em> user-focused, so you need to make that absolutely clear, without a shadow of a doubt. You can talk about methods you’ve used in the past, and how you’ve revisited user feedback throughout development to make important iterations.</p><p>If you’ve ever had to say ‘no’ to stakeholders in order to be a better advocate for your users, this is the time to make that known. Think about times you’ve had to make tough choices in order to build a better product for your users, or talk about the methods you’ve used (they could be <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/agile-product-management-study-guide/\"><strong>agile user-first frameworks</strong></a> like story mapping) or how you embed the voice of the customer into development.</p><h3>3.What main changes would you make to [our product]?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking</strong>: Pointing out flaws in someone else’s work (especially when you’re trying hard to impress them) isn’t the most comfortable conversation to have. This is a mini-test on how you deliver feedback, whilst also testing your awareness of the product.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>This (usually) isn’t a trick question. They really want to know how you would improve their product. Try to use your PM thinking skills to unpack this question. While you don’t have access to the data to back up your suggestions, you should be in a position to come up with a hypothesis.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/get-product-management-job-spotify/\"><strong>if you’re interviewing at Spotify</strong></a>, you might suggest adding a chat feature in order to easily share songs between friends, because you have personal experience of having to send links to friends via WhatsApp, which doesn’t make for the smoothest experience. Talk about how you’d find out if others had the same problem, and how you’d approach solving the problem in a user-focused way.</p><h3>4.How do you see your career developing in the next 5 years?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking: </strong>Most companies won’t want to invest the time in hiring and helping to shape a Product Manager, only to have them leave because their growth trajectory is not currently the same as what’s on offer. They want to know that you’ll be able to grow <em>with</em> them. There are a few different paths that a PM can take as they progress. They could go more into people-management and lead a team of Product Managers, or they could go more technical.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>They want to know that your career goals are a match for their company. If your goal is to get a couple of years experience with them before moving over to a different industry…that’s probably information that’s best kept to yourself if you want to get hired! Saying that, try to be as honest as possible. If there’s no room to grow within a company, and you’re ambitious with your career goals, you might be better off somewhere else.</p><p>Product Management is a fast growing career, and if you’re interviewing for a big company, they’ll want people who are hungry for that growth and who will work towards making a bigger impact and having more responsibilities.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*wE2UJ0_S8tUgXfag\" /></figure><h3>5. Tell us about a time you used data to influence an important stakeholder.</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Really, this question could have been about any situation a Product Manager is likely to face. They could just as easily ask about how you used data to validate a new idea, or how you managed the change from office-based to <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/jobs-cat/remote-product-manager/\"><strong>remote working</strong></a>. They’re asking because they need to know how you handle yourself in the day-to-day situations that PMs find themselves in. It’s a way of making sure that you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk.</p><p>It’s also about gauging the kind of experiences you’ve had in the past, and whether you’re able to solve problems, resolve conflicts, and lead their teams.</p><p><strong>What they want to know:</strong> They don’t need to know all of the details (they don’t have time to hear your life story), they want to know whether or not you’ve faced typical PM challenges and that you are adept at overcoming them. If they ask you about a situation you’ve never faced before, you can do one of two things. You can say “that’s not something that’s happened to me specifically, but in a similar vein…” and go on to talk about the next closest situation. Or if you’re <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/transition-product-management-background/\"><strong>transitioning to PM from another discipline</strong></a>, and have yet to face any real PM situations, you can talk about how you would hypothetically face that situation.</p><p>It’s mostly a thought exercise, so don’t worry about not having the right experience. Most product leaders will tell you that it’s more important to hire someone with the right instincts than to hire someone who’s been through a situation before.</p><h3>6. Tell us about a time you faced failure and how you bounced back.</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Everybody fails now and again, and more and more we’re learning that failure is nothing to be ashamed of. Any tech leader will tell you that failure is an essential hurdle on the road to success. Self-awareness is a very important trait for Product Managers, and so is being able to learn from failure. They’re asking you about your failures to see how self-aware you are, and to also understand how you process and learn from failures.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>They want to know how you respond to negative experiences, but it’s important to select an experience that ended positively for you. Put yourself in the shoes of an interviewer and look at these two answers:</p><ol><li>“In my previous role, I was told off by my manager for always being on my phone and taking personal calls. She gave me a disciplinary warning, because I didn’t realize that the company had such a strict policy on taking personal calls at work. So I learned to save my phone-time for my lunch breaks.”</li><li>“Last summer, I launched a side-project that didn’t take off the way I expected it to. It turns out that it’s going to take more resources to properly promote and market than I expected. So I’ve learned that resource-planning ahead of launch is incredibly important. I’ve put my project on the back burner for now to give me more time to strategize and up my marketing skills.”</li></ol><p>Which person would you hire? Person 1 was objectively doing something wrong. Person 2 was trying something new with the best intentions, that ended up not working. Both learned from their mistakes, but Person 2 was learning from a commonplace and justifiable mistake.</p><p>So choose your scenario carefully!</p><h3>7. What are your main strengths and weaknesses?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> This is another question that’s all about self-awareness. Recognising areas you need to improve on, or gaps in your skill set is the first step to growth and development. It’s also important for them to know if there are any areas you’re particularly weak in. For example, if they have an AI product and you don’t have strong AI skills, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but they’ll want to factor in the extra training you’ll need.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>They want to know that you’re genuinely aware of your weaknesses. None of this “I’m just <em>too </em>obsessed with work.” They want your real and raw flaws.</p><p>Think about a genuine weakness of yours, and tell them how it affects you/your work, but back it up with a plan on how you’re working on it. For example, if you find yourself trying and failing to multitask effectively, you might tell them that you’ve started implementing <a href=\"https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\"><strong>the pomodoro technique</strong></a>.</p><p>But the other part of the question is just as important. They also want to know what your strengths are. Think about the things you pride yourself on, and try to tactically identify what would be most valuable to the role.</p><h3>8. What’s your approach to prioritizing tasks?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking: </strong>Prioritization is the name of the game in Product Management, so you can probably expect this question to come up at some point in the interview process.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>You might be tempted to throw around the names of some popular prioritization techniques, and that’s fine. But it’s probably more important to talk about the soft skills around prioritization. How to say no, how to make sure you’ve listened to all of the right opinions and asked the right questions, and how to get everyone aligned on your prioritization decisions.</p><h3>9. Why do you want to work at [our company]?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Bigger companies know that their name carries a certain amount of clout. So if you’re interviewing at the Googles and Apples of the world, they want to know that you <em>really</em> want to work at Google or Apple, not just that you want to say you do.</p><p>Even for smaller companies, they want to know that they’re hiring people who have the same goals and values that they do. There’s no shame in applying for jobs because you need the bills to be paid, but it’s in a company’s interest to find the people who are going to be passionate about the work they’re doing.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>Here they’ll be looking to learn more about your goals and values, as well as what your understanding of the company’s mission is. A great position to be in, is to be able to see the future potential of a company or product, and to be able to express your eagerness to help fulfil it.</p><p>Think about where the company is going, and talk about how you’d love to fit into it.</p><h3>10. Why do you want to be/what do you love about being a Product Manager?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking</strong>: Product Management isn’t just about getting through your days work, and letting the days add up until eventually you have a product. Product Management is about hunger, and drive, and passion. You’ve got to wake up every morning excited to be doing what you’re doing, otherwise how are you going to motivate your team to feel the same?</p><p><strong>What they want to know:</strong> You should have this question answered already. And no blog, no matter how great (if we do say so ourselves) can answer it for you. Be honest, and talk about what got you started on this journey and why you’re excited to be in Product Management.</p><p>The hard part won’t be picking one. It’ll be picking <em>only</em> one.</p><h3>Summary: What Do Interviewers Want to Know?</h3><p>No matter which questions you get asked in a Product Management interview, the two best strategies for acing it is to be honest whilst thinking about what’s going on in an interviewer’s head. Cut through all of the things you <em>could</em> talk about, spend your precious time talking about the things they really need to know.</p><p>It’s very easy to say a lot without saying anything — everyone who’s ever sat through a useless team meeting will tell you that! Getting into an interviewer’s head isn’t about telling them what they want to hear, it’s about making the most of your time with them and making each second count. You want them to walk away from your interview full of reasons to hire you.</p><p>Want to learn more about acing the Product Management interview?

Tell us about a time you used data to influence an important stakeholder.\nWhy they’re asking: Really, this question could have been about any situation a Product Manager is likely to face. They could just as easily ask about how you used data to validate a new idea, or how you managed the change from office-based to remote working. They’re asking because they need to know how you handle yourself in the day-to-day situations that PMs find themselves in. It’s a way of making sure that you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk.\nIt’s also about gauging the kind of experiences you’ve had in the past, and whether you’re able to solve problems, resolve conflicts, and lead their teams.\nWhat they want to know: They don’t need to know all of the details (they don’t have time to hear your life story), they want to know whether or not you’ve faced typical PM challenges and that you are adept at overcoming them. If they ask you about a situation you’ve never faced before, you can do one of two things. You can say “that’s not something that’s happened to me specifically, but in a similar vein…” and go on to talk about the next closest situation. Or if you’re transitioning to PM from another discipline, and have yet to face any real PM situations, you can talk about how you would hypothetically face that situation.\nIt’s mostly a thought exercise, so don’t worry about not having the right experience. Most product leaders will tell you that it’s more important to hire someone with the right instincts than to hire someone who’s been through a situation before.\n6. Tell us about a time you faced failure and how you bounced back.\nWhy they’re asking: Everybody fails now and again, and more and more we’re learning that failure is nothing to be ashamed of. Any tech leader will tell you that failure is an essential hurdle on the road to success. Self-awareness is a very important trait for Product Managers, and so is being able to learn from failure. They’re asking you about your failures to see how self-aware you are, and to also understand how you process and learn from failures.\nWhat they want to know: They want to know how you respond to negative experiences, but it’s important to select an experience that ended positively for you. Put yourself in the shoes of an interviewer and look at these two answers:\n\n“In my previous role, I was told off by my manager for always being on my phone and taking personal calls. She gave me a disciplinary warning, because I didn’t realize that the company had such a strict policy on taking personal calls at work. So I learned to save my phone-time for my lunch breaks.”\n“Last summer, I launched a side-project that didn’t take off the way I expected it to. It turns out that it’s going to take more resources to properly promote and market than I expected. So I’ve learned that resource-planning ahead of launch is incredibly important. I’ve put my project on the back burner for now to give me more time to strategize and up my marketing skills.”\n\nWhich person would you hire? Person 1 was objectively doing something wrong. Person 2 was trying something new with the best intentions, that ended up not working. Both learned from their mistakes, but Person 2 was learning from a commonplace and justifiable mistake.\nSo choose your scenario carefully!\n7. What are your main strengths and weaknesses?\nWhy they’re asking: This is another question that’s all about self-awareness. Recognising areas you need to improve on, or gaps in your skill set is the first step to growth and development. It’s also important for them to know if there are any areas you’re particularly weak in. For example, if they have an AI product and you don’t have strong AI skills, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but they’ll want to factor in the extra training you’ll need.\nWhat they want to know: They want to know that you’re genuinely aware of your weaknesses. None of this “I’m just too obsessed with work.” They want your real and raw flaws.\nThink about a genuine weakness of yours, and tell them how it affects you/your work, but back it up with a plan on how you’re working on it. For example, if you find yourself trying and failing to multitask effectively, you might tell them that you’ve started implementing the pomodoro technique.\nBut the other part of the question is just as important. They also want to know what your strengths are. Think about the things you pride yourself on, and try to tactically identify what would be most valuable to the role.\n8. What’s your approach to prioritizing tasks?\nWhy they’re asking: Prioritization is the name of the game in Product Management, so you can probably expect this question to come up at some point in the interview process.\nWhat they want to know: You might be tempted to throw around the names of some popular prioritization techniques, and that’s fine. But it’s probably more important to talk about the soft skills around prioritization. How to say no, how to make sure you’ve listened to all of the right opinions and asked the right questions, and how to get everyone aligned on your prioritization decisions.\n9. Why do you want to work at [our company]?\nWhy they’re asking: Bigger companies know that their name carries a certain amount of clout. So if you’re interviewing at the Googles and Apples of the world, they want to know that you really want to work at Google or Apple, not just that you want to say you do.\nEven for smaller companies, they want to know that they’re hiring people who have the same goals and values that they do. There’s no shame in applying for jobs because you need the bills to be paid, but it’s in a company’s interest to find the people who are going to be passionate about the work they’re doing.\nWhat they want to know: Here they’ll be looking to learn more about your goals and values, as well as what your understanding of the company’s mission is. A great position to be in, is to be able to see the future potential of a company or product, and to be able to express your eagerness to help fulfil it.\nThink about where the company is going, and talk about how you’d love to fit into it.\n10. Why do you want to be/what do you love about being a Product Manager?\nWhy they’re asking: Product Management isn’t just about getting through your days work, and letting the days add up until eventually you have a product. Product Management is about hunger, and drive, and passion. You’ve got to wake up every morning excited to be doing what you’re doing, otherwise how are you going to motivate your team to feel the same?\nWhat they want to know: You should have this question answered already. And no blog, no matter how great (if we do say so ourselves) can answer it for you. Be honest, and talk about what got you started on this journey and why you’re excited to be in Product Management.\nThe hard part won’t be picking one. It’ll be picking only one.\nSummary: What Do Interviewers Want to Know?\nNo matter which questions you get asked in a Product Management interview, the two best strategies for acing it is to be honest whilst thinking about what’s going on in an interviewer’s head. Cut through all of the things you could talk about, spend your precious time talking about the things they really need to know.\nIt’s very easy to say a lot without saying anything — everyone who’s ever sat through a useless team meeting will tell you that! Getting into an interviewer’s head isn’t about telling them what they want to hear, it’s about making the most of your time with them and making each second count. You want them to walk away from your interview full of reasons to hire you.\nWant to learn more about acing the Product Management interview?

Although both are essential, not all firms have the funds to do both or the skill sets to develop capabilities in data management or analysis algorithms, or the partner ecosystem to leverage, collaborate, co-create, and share risk. Furthermore, these firms may not have experience in setting up governance and compliance structures to use clinical data in compliance with regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specific internal capabilities, as well as planning and resources are required to develop and maintain a digital ecosystem to realize the multiple benefits of data, analytics, and collaboration with appropriate partners. Platforms offer a cloud-based ecosystem for secure access and data sharing among multiple stakeholders, enabled by digital tools and applications while providing an avenue for like-minded firms to collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way, platform as a service (PaaS) allows users to leverage a subscription-based data and cloud computing service without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. It allows users to access, develop, and run applications, and unify digital transformation using a single platform, reducing the use of resources needed to drive transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Data is in silos, and to optimize clinical pathways, all stakeholders need to work together by co-creating and co-opeting,” says Max Milz, senior partner and senior vice president at Siemens Advanta Consulting. “In other words, data needs to be accessed, processed, stored, analyzed, and shared in a secure and compliant manner for it to be useful to different stakeholders. PaaS is one of the enablers for driving this integration. Medical technology companies can accelerate their digital transformation efforts by leveraging first-mile connectivity to a hospital ecosystem and last-mile access to data offered by the teamplay digital health platform.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Medical technology needs a specific platform</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most health-care data management use cases are industry-specific with requirements to access imaging, pathology, and clinical data. Stakeholders considering a platform would benefit from collaborating with one that has domain specificity and is incubated and managed by another experienced medical technology organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A platform specific to medical technology offers vertical domain expertise from a market access and connectivity perspective, access to relevant data, specific applications for that sector, and experience of the security and regulatory compliance requirements, allowing partners to focus on the development of their core solutions and value propositions. Using a medical technology PaaS offers medical equipment and device companies the flexibility to adapt continuously to evolving market needs, optimizing investment in time and resources while being guided by a valued partner with experience of developing a platform fit for purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a competitive market, medical technology companies must focus on accelerated product development while partnering with the best PaaS provider to help realize their overall digital transformation goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The majority of medical technology companies have a strong product presence,” explains Thomas Friese, senior vice president for digital platforms at Siemens Healthineers. “However, what they also need is to transform to a sustainable service model.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s no need to go it alone. “Co-opetition is gathering prominence in medical technology and pharma, and all stakeholders stand to only benefit from integration. PaaS will become very relevant in this context, thus positioning teamplay digital health platform uniquely, with its domain-specific expertise and digital transformation capabilities,” Friese says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A</strong><strong> proven and compliant PaaS platform: teamplay</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A company with extensive experience in imaging and diagnostics can build a platform that brings together a strong diagnostic and therapeutic core and specialized digital offerings, and systematically expand it across multiple functionalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several use cases can be used as templates for technology advancement, enabling partners to achieve their objectives. teamplay acts as a technology accelerator for medical technology companies, providing first-mile connectivity and last-mile access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a medical technology-specific platform provider, Siemens Healthineers offers vertical domain expertise and industry expertise, differentiating it from horizontal platform capabilities offered by leading IT companies. The subscription model also allows users to spread the investment over time and generate higher returns by giving partners a head start. Overall, Siemens Healthineers has a clear vision of where it fits with partners by increasing fidelity and ease of use while decreasing time and effort for its partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Partnering offers advantages for digital transformation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of partnering in creating a PaaS are evident: it is a more strategic and long-term option with the opportunity to collaborate, co-create, and share risk. Compared with building a platform, partnering provides scalability by optimizing time, resources, and investment. While building a platform with a public cloud services provider, medical technology companies are still required to network with hospitals for data access and arrange integration with devices and the health-care IT ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partnering with a medical technology PaaS, however, offers scalability in terms of access and connectivity and the ability for the platform to evolve by onboarding new products, applications, and vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical technology companies must choose a partner whose vision, breadth, and service align with overall digital transformation efforts.

POET generates the obstacle courses, assesses the bots’ abilities, and assigns their next challenge, all without human involvement. Step by faltering step, the bots improve&nbsp;via trial and error. “At some point it might jump over a cliff like a kung fu master,” says Wang.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may seem basic at the moment, but for Wang and a handful of other researchers, POET hints at a revolutionary new way to create supersmart machines: by getting AI to make itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wang’s former colleague Jeff Clune is among the biggest boosters of this idea. Clune has been working on it for years, first at the University of Wyoming and then at Uber AI Labs, where he worked with Wang and others. Now dividing his time between the University of British Columbia and OpenAI, he has the backing of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/\">one of the world’s top artificial-intelligence labs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune calls the attempt to build truly intelligent AI the most ambitious scientific quest in human history. Today, seven decades after serious efforts to make AI began, we’re still a long way from creating machines that are anywhere near as smart as humans, let alone smarter. Clune thinks POET might point to a shortcut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We need to take the shackles off and get out of our own way,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Clune is right, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10985.pdf\">using AI to make AI</a> could be an important step on the road that one day leads to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/15/1010461/artificial-general-intelligence-robots-ai-agi-deepmind-google-openai/\">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI)—machines that can outthink humans. In the nearer term, the technique might also help us discover different kinds of intelligence: non-human smarts that can find solutions in unexpected ways and perhaps complement our own intelligence rather than replace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mimicking evolution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I first spoke to Clune about the idea early last year, just a few weeks after his move to OpenAI. He was happy to discuss past work but remained tight-lipped on what he was doing with his new team. Instead of taking the call inside, he preferred to walk up and down the streets outside the offices as we talked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Clune would say was that OpenAI was a good fit. “My idea is very much in line with many of the things that they believe,” he says. “It was kind of a marriage made in heaven. They liked the vision and wanted me to come here and pursue it.” A few months after Clune joined, OpenAI hired most of his old Uber team as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune’s ambitious vision is grounded by more than OpenAI’s investment. The history of AI is filled with examples in which human-designed solutions gave way to machine-learned ones. Take computer vision: a decade ago, the big breakthrough in image recognition came when existing hand-crafted systems were replaced by ones that taught themselves from scratch. It’s the same for many AI successes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the fascinating things about AI, and machine learning in particular, is its ability to find <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/12/08/147199/alpha-zeros-alien-chess-shows-the-power-and-the-peculiarity-of-ai/\">solutions that humans haven’t found</a>—to surprise us. An oft-cited example is AlphaGo (and its successor AlphaZero), which beat the best humanity has to offer at the ancient, beguiling game of Go by employing seemingly alien strategies. After hundreds of years of study by human masters, AI found solutions no one had ever thought of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune is now working with a team at OpenAI that developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/17/75427/open-ai-algorithms-learned-tool-use-and-cooperation-after-hide-and-seek-games/\">bots that learned to play hide and seek</a>&nbsp;in a virtual environment in 2018. These AIs started off with simple goals and simple tools to achieve them: one pair had to find the other, which could hide behind movable obstacles. Yet when these bots were let loose to learn, they soon found ways to take advantage of their environment in ways the researchers had not foreseen. They exploited glitches in the simulated physics of their virtual world to jump over and even pass through walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those kinds of unexpected emergent behaviors offer tantalizing hints that AI might arrive at technical solutions humans would not think of by themselves,&nbsp;inventing new and more efficient types of algorithms or neural networks—or even ditching neural networks, a cornerstone of modern AI, entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune likes to remind people that intelligence has already emerged from simple beginnings. “What’s interesting about this approach is that we know it can work,” he says. “The very simple algorithm of Darwinian evolution produced your brain, and your brain is the most intelligent learning algorithm in the universe that we know so far.” His point is that if intelligence as we know it resulted from the mindless mutation of genes over countless generations, why not seek to replicate the intelligence-producing process—which is arguably simpler—rather than intelligence itself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s another crucial observation here. Intelligence was never an endpoint for evolution, something to aim for. Instead, it emerged in many different forms from countless tiny solutions to challenges that allowed living things to survive and take on future challenges. Intelligence is the current high point in an ongoing and open-ended process. In this sense, evolution is quite different from algorithms the way people typically think of them—as means to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s this open-endedness, glimpsed in the apparently aimless sequence of challenges generated by POET, that Clune and others believe could lead to new kinds of AI. For decades AI researchers have tried to build algorithms to mimic human intelligence, but the real breakthrough may come from building algorithms that try to mimic the open-ended problem-solving of evolution—and sitting back to watch what emerges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers are already using machine learning on itself, training it to find solutions to some of the field’s hardest problems, such as how to make machines that can learn more than one task at a time or cope with situations they have not encountered before. Some now think that taking this approach and running with it might be the best path to artificial general intelligence.&nbsp;“We could start an algorithm that initially does not have much intelligence inside it, and watch it bootstrap itself all the way up potentially to AGI,” Clune says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that for now, AGI remains a fantasy. But that’s largely because nobody knows how to make&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Advances in AI are piecemeal and carried out by humans, with progress typically involving tweaks to existing techniques or algorithms, yielding incremental leaps in performance or accuracy. Clune characterizes these efforts as attempts to discover the building blocks for artificial intelligence without knowing what you’re looking for or how many blocks you’ll need. And that’s just the start. “At some point, we have to take on the Herculean task of putting them all together,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking AI to find and&nbsp;assemble those building blocks for us&nbsp;is a paradigm shift. It’s saying we want to create an intelligent machine, but we don’t care what it might look like—just give us whatever works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if AGI is never achieved, the self-teaching approach may still change what sorts of AI are created. The world needs&nbsp;more than a very good Go player, says Clune. For him, creating a supersmart machine means building a system that invents its own challenges, solves them, and then invents new ones. POET is a tiny glimpse of this in action. Clune imagines a machine that teaches a bot to walk, then to play hopscotch, then maybe to play Go. “Then maybe it learns math puzzles and starts inventing its own challenges,” he says. “The system continuously innovates, and the sky’s the limit in terms of where it might go.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s wild speculation, perhaps, but one hope is that machines like this might be able to evade our conceptual dead ends, helping us unpick vastly complex crises such as climate change or global health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first we have to make one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to create a brain</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different ways to wire up an artificial brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neural networks are made from multiple layers of artificial neurons encoded in software. Each neuron can be connected to others in the layers above. The way a neural network is wired makes a big difference, and new architectures often lead to new breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The neural networks coded by human scientists are often the result of trial and error. There is little theory to what does and doesn’t work, and no guarantee that the best designs have been found. That’s why automating the hunt for better neural-network designs has been one of the hottest topics in AI since at least the 1980s. The most common way to automate the process is to let an AI generate many possible network designs, and let the network automatically try each of them and choose the best ones. This is commonly known as neuro-evolution or neural architecture search (NAS).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, these machine designs have started to outstrip human ones. In 2018, Esteban Real and his colleagues at Google used NAS to generate a neural network for image recognition that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01548.pdf\">beat the best human-designed networks</a> at the time. That was an eye-opener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2018 system is part of an ongoing Google project called AutoML, which has also used NAS to produce EfficientNets, a family of deep-learning models that are<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">more efficient than human-designed ones</a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">, achieving high levels of accuracy on image-recognition tasks with smaller, faster models.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years on, Real is pushing the boundaries of what can be generated from scratch. The earlier systems just rearranged tried and tested neural-network pieces, such as existing types of layers or components. “We could expect a good answer,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year Real and his team took the training wheels off. The new system, called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03384\">AutoML Zero</a>, tries to build an AI from the ground up using nothing but the most basic mathematical concepts that govern machine learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazingly, not only did AutoML Zero spontaneously build a neural network, but it came up with gradient descent, the most common mathematical technique that human designers use to train a network. “I was quite surprised,” says Real. “It’s a very simple algorithm—it takes like six lines of code—but it wrote the exact six lines.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AutoML Zero is not yet generating architectures that rival the performance of human-designed systems—or indeed doing much that a human designer would not have done. But Real believes it could one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Time to train a new kind of teacher</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First you make a brain; then you have to teach it. But machine brains don’t learn the way ours do. Our brains are fantastic at adapting to new environments and new tasks. Today’s AIs can solve challenges under certain conditions but fail when those conditions change even a little. This inflexibility is hampering the quest to create more generalizable AI that can be useful across a wide range of scenarios, which would be a big step toward making them truly intelligent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Jane Wang, a researcher at DeepMind in London, the best way to make AI more flexible is to get it to learn that trait itself. In other words, she wants to build an AI that not only learns specific tasks but learns to learn those tasks in ways that can be adapted to fresh situations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers have been trying to make AI more adaptable for years. Wang thinks that getting AI to work through this problem for itself avoids some of the trial and error of a hand-designed approach: “We can’t possibly expect to stumble upon the right answer right away.” In the process, she hopes, we will also learn more about how brains work. “There’s still so much we don’t understand about the way that humans and animals learn,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main approaches to generating learning algorithms automatically, but both start with an existing neural network and use AI to teach it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first approach, invented separately by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05763\">Wang and her colleagues at DeepMind</a>&nbsp;and by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02779.pdf\">a team at OpenAI</a>&nbsp;at around the same time, uses recurrent neural networks. This type of network can be trained in such a way that the activations of their neurons—roughly akin to the firing of neurons in biological brains—encode any type of algorithm. DeepMind and OpenAI took advantage of this to train a recurrent neural network to generate reinforcement-learning algorithms, which tell an AI how to behave to achieve given goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upshot is that the DeepMind and OpenAI systems do not learn an algorithm that solve a specific challenge, such as recognizing images, but learn a&nbsp;<em>learning&nbsp;</em>algorithm that can be applied to multiple tasks and adapt as it goes. It’s like the old adage about teaching someone to fish: whereas a hand-designed algorithm can learn a particular task, these AIs are being made to learn how to learn by themselves. And some of them are performing better than human-designed ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second approach comes from Chelsea Finn at the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues. Called <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/07/18/learning-to-learn/\">model-agnostic meta-learning</a>, or MAML, it trains a model using two machine-learning processes, one nested inside the other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roughly, here’s how it works. The inner process in MAML is trained on data and then tested—as usual. But then the outer model takes the performance of the inner model—how well it identifies images, say—and uses it to learn how to adjust that model’s learning algorithm to boost performance. It’s as if you had an school inspector watching over a bunch of teachers, each offering different learning techniques. The inspector checks which techniques help the students get the best scores and tweaks them accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these approaches, researchers are building AI that is more robust, more generalized, and able to learn faster with less data. For example, Finn wants a robot that has learned to walk on flat ground to be able to transition, with minimal extra training, to walking on a slope or on grass or while carrying a load.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Clune and his colleagues extended Finn’s technique to design an algorithm that learns using fewer neurons so that it does not overwrite everything it has learned previously, a big unsolved problem in machine learning known as catastrophic forgetting. A trained model that uses fewer neurons, known as a “sparse” model, will have more unused neurons left over to dedicate to new tasks when retrained, which means that fewer of the “used” neurons will get overwritten. Clune found that setting his AI the challenge of learning more than one task led it to come up with its own version of a sparse model that outperformed human-designed ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we’re going all in on letting AI create and teach itself, then AIs should generate their own training environments, too—the schools and textbooks, as well as the lesson plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the past year has seen a raft of projects in which AI has been trained on automatically generated data. Face-recognition systems are being trained with AI-generated faces, for example. AIs are also learning how to train each other. In one recent example, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/22/1016633/robot-arms-smarter-self-play-reinforcement-learning-training-openai/\">two robot arms</a> worked together, with one arm learning to set tougher and tougher block-stacking challenges that trained the other to grip and grasp objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Clune wonders if human intuition about what kind of data an AI needs in order to learn may be off. For example, he and his colleagues have developed what he calls <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07768.pdf\">generative teaching networks</a>, which learn what data they should generate to get the best results when training a model. In one experiment, he used one of these networks to adapt a data set of handwritten numbers that’s often used to train image-recognition algorithms. What it came up with looked very different from the original human-curated data set: hundreds of not-quite digits, such as the top half of the figure seven or what looked like two digits merged together. Some AI-generated examples were hard to decipher at all. Despite this, the AI-generated data still did a great job at training the handwriting recognition system to identify actual digits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Don’t try to succeed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-generated data is still just a part of the puzzle. The long-term vision is to take all these techniques—and others not yet invented—and hand them over to an AI trainer that controls how artificial brains are wired, how they are trained, and what they are trained on. Even Clune is not clear on what such a future system would look like. Sometimes he talks about a kind of hyper-realistic simulated sandbox, where AIs can cut their teeth and skin their virtual knees. Something that complex is still years away. The closest thing yet is POET, the system Clune created with Uber’s Rui Wang and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET was motivated by a paradox, says Wang. If you try to solve a problem you’ll fail; if you don’t try to solve it you’re more likely to succeed. This is one of the insights Clune takes from his analogy with evolution—amazing results that emerge from an apparently random process often cannot be re-created by taking deliberate steps toward the same end. There’s no doubt that butterflies exist, but rewind to their single-celled precursors and try to create them from scratch by choosing each step from bacterium to bug, and you’d likely fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET starts its two-legged agent off in a simple environment, such as a flat path without obstacles. At first the agent doesn’t know what to do with its legs and cannot walk. But through trial and error, the reinforcement-learning algorithm controlling it learns how to move along flat ground. POET then generates a new random environment that’s different, but not necessarily harder to move in. The agent tries walking there. If there are obstacles in this new environment, the agent learns how to get over or across those. Every time an agent succeeds or gets stuck, it is moved to a new environment. Over time, the agents learn a range of walking and jumping actions that let them navigate harder and harder obstacle courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team found that random switching of environments was essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, agents sometimes learned to walk on flat ground with a weird, half-kneeling shuffle, because that was good enough. “They never learn to stand up because they never need to,” says Wang. But after they had been forced to learn alternative strategies on obstacle-strewn ground, they could return to the early stage with a better way of walking—using both legs instead of dragging one behind, say—and then take that improved version of itself forward to harder challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET trains its bots in a way that no human would—it takes erratic, unintuitive paths to success. At each stage, the bots try to figure out a solution to whatever challenge they are presented with. By coping with a random selection of obstacles thrown their way, they get better overall. But there is no end point to this process, no ultimate test to pass or high score to beat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune, Wang, and a number of their colleagues believe this is a profound insight. They are now exploring what it might mean for the development of supersmart machines. Could trying&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to chart a specific path actually be a key breakthrough on the way to artificial general intelligence?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET is already inspiring other researchers, such as Natasha Jaques and Michael Dennis at the University of California, Berkeley. They’ve developed a system called <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/03/paired-new-multi-agent-approach-for.html\">PAIRED</a> that uses AI to generate a series of mazes to train another AI to navigate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rui Wang thinks human-designed challenges are going to be a bottleneck and that real progress in AI will require AI to come up with its own. “No matter how good algorithms are today, they are always tested on some hand-designed benchmark,” he says. “It’s very hard to imagine artificial general intelligence coming from this, because it is bound by fixed goals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A new kind of intelligence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rapid development of AI that can train itself also raises questions about how well we can control its growth. The idea of AI that builds better AI is a crucial part of the myth-making behind the “Singularity,” the imagined point in the future when AIs start to improve at an exponential rate and move beyond our control. Eventually, certain doomsayers warn, AI might decide it doesn’t need humans at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not what any of these researchers have in mind: their work is very much focused on making today’s AI better. Machines that run amok remain a far-off anti-fantasy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, DeepMind’s Jane Wang has reservations. A big part of the attraction of using AI to make AI is that it can come up with designs and techniques that people hadn’t thought of. Yet Wang notes that not all surprises are good surprises: “Open-endedness is, by definition, something that’s unexpected.” If the whole idea is to get AI to do something you didn’t anticipate, it becomes harder to control. “That’s both exciting and scary,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune also stresses the importance of thinking about the ethics of the new technology from the start. There is a good chance that AI-designed neural networks and algorithms will be even harder to understand than today’s already opaque black-box systems. Are AIs generated by algorithms harder to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/11/1017955/auditors-testing-ai-hiring-algorithms-bias-big-questions-remain/\">audit for bias</a>? Is it harder to guarantee that they will not behave in undesirable ways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune hopes such questions will be asked and answered as more people realize the potential of self-generating AIs. “Most people in the machine-learning community don’t ever really talk about our overall path to extremely powerful AI,” he says—instead, they tend to focus on small, incremental improvements. Clune wants to start a conversation about the field’s biggest ambitions again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His own ambitions tie back into his early interests in human intelligence and how it evolved. His grand vision is to set things up so that machines might one day see their own intelligence—or intelligences—emerge and improve through countless generations of trial and error, guided by algorithms with no ultimate blueprint in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If AI starts to generate intelligence by itself, there’s no guarantee that it will be human-like. Rather than humans teaching machines to think like humans, machines might teach humans new ways of thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s probably a vast number of different ways to be very intelligent,” says Clune. “One of the things that excite me about AI is that we might come to understand intelligence more generally, by seeing what variation is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that’s fascinating. I mean, it’s almost like inventing interstellar travel and being able to go visit alien cultures. There would be no greater moment in the history of humankind than encountering an alien race and learning about its culture, its science, everything. Interstellar travel is exceedingly difficult, but we have the ability to potentially create alien intelligences digitally.”</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"A little stick figure with a wedge-shaped head shuffles across the screen.

It’s the same for many AI successes. \nOne of the fascinating things about AI, and machine learning in particular, is its ability to find solutions that humans haven’t found—to surprise us. An oft-cited example is AlphaGo (and its successor AlphaZero), which beat the best humanity has to offer at the ancient, beguiling game of Go by employing seemingly alien strategies. After hundreds of years of study by human masters, AI found solutions no one had ever thought of. \nClune is now working with a team at OpenAI that developed bots that learned to play hide and seek in a virtual environment in 2018. These AIs started off with simple goals and simple tools to achieve them: one pair had to find the other, which could hide behind movable obstacles. Yet when these bots were let loose to learn, they soon found ways to take advantage of their environment in ways the researchers had not foreseen. They exploited glitches in the simulated physics of their virtual world to jump over and even pass through walls.\nThose kinds of unexpected emergent behaviors offer tantalizing hints that AI might arrive at technical solutions humans would not think of by themselves, inventing new and more efficient types of algorithms or neural networks—or even ditching neural networks, a cornerstone of modern AI, entirely.\nClune likes to remind people that intelligence has already emerged from simple beginnings. “What’s interesting about this approach is that we know it can work,” he says. “The very simple algorithm of Darwinian evolution produced your brain, and your brain is the most intelligent learning algorithm in the universe that we know so far.” His point is that if intelligence as we know it resulted from the mindless mutation of genes over countless generations, why not seek to replicate the intelligence-producing process—which is arguably simpler—rather than intelligence itself? \nBut there’s another crucial observation here. Intelligence was never an endpoint for evolution, something to aim for. Instead, it emerged in many different forms from countless tiny solutions to challenges that allowed living things to survive and take on future challenges. Intelligence is the current high point in an ongoing and open-ended process. In this sense, evolution is quite different from algorithms the way people typically think of them—as means to an end. \nIt’s this open-endedness, glimpsed in the apparently aimless sequence of challenges generated by POET, that Clune and others believe could lead to new kinds of AI. For decades AI researchers have tried to build algorithms to mimic human intelligence, but the real breakthrough may come from building algorithms that try to mimic the open-ended problem-solving of evolution—and sitting back to watch what emerges. \nResearchers are already using machine learning on itself, training it to find solutions to some of the field’s hardest problems, such as how to make machines that can learn more than one task at a time or cope with situations they have not encountered before. Some now think that taking this approach and running with it might be the best path to artificial general intelligence. “We could start an algorithm that initially does not have much intelligence inside it, and watch it bootstrap itself all the way up potentially to AGI,” Clune says.\nThe truth is that for now, AGI remains a fantasy. But that’s largely because nobody knows how to make it. Advances in AI are piecemeal and carried out by humans, with progress typically involving tweaks to existing techniques or algorithms, yielding incremental leaps in performance or accuracy. Clune characterizes these efforts as attempts to discover the building blocks for artificial intelligence without knowing what you’re looking for or how many blocks you’ll need. And that’s just the start. “At some point, we have to take on the Herculean task of putting them all together,” he says.\nAsking AI to find and assemble those building blocks for us is a paradigm shift. It’s saying we want to create an intelligent machine, but we don’t care what it might look like—just give us whatever works. \nEven if AGI is never achieved, the self-teaching approach may still change what sorts of AI are created. The world needs more than a very good Go player, says Clune. For him, creating a supersmart machine means building a system that invents its own challenges, solves them, and then invents new ones. POET is a tiny glimpse of this in action. Clune imagines a machine that teaches a bot to walk, then to play hopscotch, then maybe to play Go. “Then maybe it learns math puzzles and starts inventing its own challenges,” he says. “The system continuously innovates, and the sky’s the limit in terms of where it might go.”\nIt’s wild speculation, perhaps, but one hope is that machines like this might be able to evade our conceptual dead ends, helping us unpick vastly complex crises such as climate change or global health. \nBut first we have to make one. \nHow to create a brain\nThere are many different ways to wire up an artificial brain.\nNeural networks are made from multiple layers of artificial neurons encoded in software. Each neuron can be connected to others in the layers above. The way a neural network is wired makes a big difference, and new architectures often lead to new breakthroughs. \nThe neural networks coded by human scientists are often the result of trial and error. There is little theory to what does and doesn’t work, and no guarantee that the best designs have been found. That’s why automating the hunt for better neural-network designs has been one of the hottest topics in AI since at least the 1980s. The most common way to automate the process is to let an AI generate many possible network designs, and let the network automatically try each of them and choose the best ones. This is commonly known as neuro-evolution or neural architecture search (NAS).\nIn the last few years, these machine designs have started to outstrip human ones. In 2018, Esteban Real and his colleagues at Google used NAS to generate a neural network for image recognition that beat the best human-designed networks at the time. That was an eye-opener.\nThe 2018 system is part of an ongoing Google project called AutoML, which has also used NAS to produce EfficientNets, a family of deep-learning models that are more efficient than human-designed ones, achieving high levels of accuracy on image-recognition tasks with smaller, faster models.\nThree years on, Real is pushing the boundaries of what can be generated from scratch. The earlier systems just rearranged tried and tested neural-network pieces, such as existing types of layers or components. “We could expect a good answer,” he says.\nLast year Real and his team took the training wheels off. The new system, called AutoML Zero, tries to build an AI from the ground up using nothing but the most basic mathematical concepts that govern machine learning.\nAmazingly, not only did AutoML Zero spontaneously build a neural network, but it came up with gradient descent, the most common mathematical technique that human designers use to train a network. “I was quite surprised,” says Real. “It’s a very simple algorithm—it takes like six lines of code—but it wrote the exact six lines.”\nAutoML Zero is not yet generating architectures that rival the performance of human-designed systems—or indeed doing much that a human designer would not have done. But Real believes it could one day.\nTime to train a new kind of teacher\nFirst you make a brain; then you have to teach it. But machine brains don’t learn the way ours do. Our brains are fantastic at adapting to new environments and new tasks. Today’s AIs can solve challenges under certain conditions but fail when those conditions change even a little. This inflexibility is hampering the quest to create more generalizable AI that can be useful across a wide range of scenarios, which would be a big step toward making them truly intelligent.\nFor Jane Wang, a researcher at DeepMind in London, the best way to make AI more flexible is to get it to learn that trait itself. In other words, she wants to build an AI that not only learns specific tasks but learns to learn those tasks in ways that can be adapted to fresh situations. \nResearchers have been trying to make AI more adaptable for years. Wang thinks that getting AI to work through this problem for itself avoids some of the trial and error of a hand-designed approach: “We can’t possibly expect to stumble upon the right answer right away.” In the process, she hopes, we will also learn more about how brains work. “There’s still so much we don’t understand about the way that humans and animals learn,” she says.\nThere are two main approaches to generating learning algorithms automatically, but both start with an existing neural network and use AI to teach it.\nThe first approach, invented separately by Wang and her colleagues at DeepMind and by a team at OpenAI at around the same time, uses recurrent neural networks. This type of network can be trained in such a way that the activations of their neurons—roughly akin to the firing of neurons in biological brains—encode any type of algorithm. DeepMind and OpenAI took advantage of this to train a recurrent neural network to generate reinforcement-learning algorithms, which tell an AI how to behave to achieve given goals. \nThe upshot is that the DeepMind and OpenAI systems do not learn an algorithm that solve a specific challenge, such as recognizing images, but learn a learning algorithm that can be applied to multiple tasks and adapt as it goes. It’s like the old adage about teaching someone to fish: whereas a hand-designed algorithm can learn a particular task, these AIs are being made to learn how to learn by themselves. And some of them are performing better than human-designed ones.\nThe second approach comes from Chelsea Finn at the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues. Called model-agnostic meta-learning, or MAML, it trains a model using two machine-learning processes, one nested inside the other. \nRoughly, here’s how it works. The inner process in MAML is trained on data and then tested—as usual. But then the outer model takes the performance of the inner model—how well it identifies images, say—and uses it to learn how to adjust that model’s learning algorithm to boost performance. It’s as if you had an school inspector watching over a bunch of teachers, each offering different learning techniques. The inspector checks which techniques help the students get the best scores and tweaks them accordingly. \nThrough these approaches, researchers are building AI that is more robust, more generalized, and able to learn faster with less data. For example, Finn wants a robot that has learned to walk on flat ground to be able to transition, with minimal extra training, to walking on a slope or on grass or while carrying a load. \nLast year, Clune and his colleagues extended Finn’s technique to design an algorithm that learns using fewer neurons so that it does not overwrite everything it has learned previously, a big unsolved problem in machine learning known as catastrophic forgetting. A trained model that uses fewer neurons, known as a “sparse” model, will have more unused neurons left over to dedicate to new tasks when retrained, which means that fewer of the “used” neurons will get overwritten. Clune found that setting his AI the challenge of learning more than one task led it to come up with its own version of a sparse model that outperformed human-designed ones. \nIf we’re going all in on letting AI create and teach itself, then AIs should generate their own training environments, too—the schools and textbooks, as well as the lesson plans.\nAnd the past year has seen a raft of projects in which AI has been trained on automatically generated data. Face-recognition systems are being trained with AI-generated faces, for example. AIs are also learning how to train each other. In one recent example, two robot arms worked together, with one arm learning to set tougher and tougher block-stacking challenges that trained the other to grip and grasp objects.\nIn fact, Clune wonders if human intuition about what kind of data an AI needs in order to learn may be off. For example, he and his colleagues have developed what he calls generative teaching networks, which learn what data they should generate to get the best results when training a model. In one experiment, he used one of these networks to adapt a data set of handwritten numbers that’s often used to train image-recognition algorithms. What it came up with looked very different from the original human-curated data set: hundreds of not-quite digits, such as the top half of the figure seven or what looked like two digits merged together. Some AI-generated examples were hard to decipher at all. Despite this, the AI-generated data still did a great job at training the handwriting recognition system to identify actual digits. \nDon’t try to succeed\nAI-generated data is still just a part of the puzzle. The long-term vision is to take all these techniques—and others not yet invented—and hand them over to an AI trainer that controls how artificial brains are wired, how they are trained, and what they are trained on. Even Clune is not clear on what such a future system would look like. Sometimes he talks about a kind of hyper-realistic simulated sandbox, where AIs can cut their teeth and skin their virtual knees. Something that complex is still years away. The closest thing yet is POET, the system Clune created with Uber’s Rui Wang and others.\nPOET was motivated by a paradox, says Wang. If you try to solve a problem you’ll fail; if you don’t try to solve it you’re more likely to succeed. This is one of the insights Clune takes from his analogy with evolution—amazing results that emerge from an apparently random process often cannot be re-created by taking deliberate steps toward the same end. There’s no doubt that butterflies exist, but rewind to their single-celled precursors and try to create them from scratch by choosing each step from bacterium to bug, and you’d likely fail.\nPOET starts its two-legged agent off in a simple environment, such as a flat path without obstacles. At first the agent doesn’t know what to do with its legs and cannot walk. But through trial and error, the reinforcement-learning algorithm controlling it learns how to move along flat ground. POET then generates a new random environment that’s different, but not necessarily harder to move in. The agent tries walking there. If there are obstacles in this new environment, the agent learns how to get over or across those. Every time an agent succeeds or gets stuck, it is moved to a new environment. Over time, the agents learn a range of walking and jumping actions that let them navigate harder and harder obstacle courses.\nThe team found that random switching of environments was essential.\nFor example, agents sometimes learned to walk on flat ground with a weird, half-kneeling shuffle, because that was good enough. “They never learn to stand up because they never need to,” says Wang. But after they had been forced to learn alternative strategies on obstacle-strewn ground, they could return to the early stage with a better way of walking—using both legs instead of dragging one behind, say—and then take that improved version of itself forward to harder challenges.\nPOET trains its bots in a way that no human would—it takes erratic, unintuitive paths to success. At each stage, the bots try to figure out a solution to whatever challenge they are presented with. By coping with a random selection of obstacles thrown their way, they get better overall. But there is no end point to this process, no ultimate test to pass or high score to beat. \nClune, Wang, and a number of their colleagues believe this is a profound insight. They are now exploring what it might mean for the development of supersmart machines. Could trying not to chart a specific path actually be a key breakthrough on the way to artificial general intelligence? \nPOET is already inspiring other researchers, such as Natasha Jaques and Michael Dennis at the University of California, Berkeley. They’ve developed a system called PAIRED that uses AI to generate a series of mazes to train another AI to navigate them.\nRui Wang thinks human-designed challenges are going to be a bottleneck and that real progress in AI will require AI to come up with its own. “No matter how good algorithms are today, they are always tested on some hand-designed benchmark,” he says. “It’s very hard to imagine artificial general intelligence coming from this, because it is bound by fixed goals.”\nA new kind of intelligence\nThe rapid development of AI that can train itself also raises questions about how well we can control its growth. The idea of AI that builds better AI is a crucial part of the myth-making behind the “Singularity,” the imagined point in the future when AIs start to improve at an exponential rate and move beyond our control. Eventually, certain doomsayers warn, AI might decide it doesn’t need humans at all.\nThat’s not what any of these researchers have in mind: their work is very much focused on making today’s AI better. Machines that run amok remain a far-off anti-fantasy. \nEven so, DeepMind’s Jane Wang has reservations. A big part of the attraction of using AI to make AI is that it can come up with designs and techniques that people hadn’t thought of. Yet Wang notes that not all surprises are good surprises: “Open-endedness is, by definition, something that’s unexpected.” If the whole idea is to get AI to do something you didn’t anticipate, it becomes harder to control. “That’s both exciting and scary,” she says. \nClune also stresses the importance of thinking about the ethics of the new technology from the start. There is a good chance that AI-designed neural networks and algorithms will be even harder to understand than today’s already opaque black-box systems. Are AIs generated by algorithms harder to audit for bias? Is it harder to guarantee that they will not behave in undesirable ways?\nClune hopes such questions will be asked and answered as more people realize the potential of self-generating AIs. “Most people in the machine-learning community don’t ever really talk about our overall path to extremely powerful AI,” he says—instead, they tend to focus on small, incremental improvements. Clune wants to start a conversation about the field’s biggest ambitions again.\nHis own ambitions tie back into his early interests in human intelligence and how it evolved. His grand vision is to set things up so that machines might one day see their own intelligence—or intelligences—emerge and improve through countless generations of trial and error, guided by algorithms with no ultimate blueprint in mind. \nIf AI starts to generate intelligence by itself, there’s no guarantee that it will be human-like. Rather than humans teaching machines to think like humans, machines might teach humans new ways of thinking.\n“There’s probably a vast number of different ways to be very intelligent,” says Clune. “One of the things that excite me about AI is that we might come to understand intelligence more generally, by seeing what variation is possible.\n“I think that’s fascinating. I mean, it’s almost like inventing interstellar travel and being able to go visit alien cultures. There would be no greater moment in the history of humankind than encountering an alien race and learning about its culture, its science, everything. Interstellar travel is exceedingly difficult, but we have the ability to potentially create alien intelligences digitally.”","dc:creator":"Will Douglas Heaven","content":"A little stick figure with a wedge-shaped head&#160;shuffles across the screen.

My mother is a Japanese woman who was born and raised in a rural town in Japan. Because of their significant cultural and language differences, I grew up watching my parents find extremely creative ways to converse with one another on complicated subjects. When they were discussing the history of race relations in America, my father would use creative metaphors and illustrations to demonstrate concepts.

I asked her why.</p><p>She explained, “Because tigers are strong and alligators can breathe underwater and owls can fly and…” you get the idea.</p><p>As a 31-year-old data scientist working in corporate finance, I had grown entirely out of touch with what children find intriguing.

When I considered it even further, I realized that it speaks to a desire that many people have: the ability to have limitless abilities.</p><p>Companies like Udemy and other MOOCs were a game-changer, because they were addressing this exact desire — the desire to have no limits to self improvement. Self help books and productivity apps are also very popular, perhaps for similar reasons.</p><p>Sometimes children provide powerful messages on innovation through their playful delivery. When you get the opportunity, pay attention! You never know whether an offhanded remark from a child could spark your next great idea.</p><p>Throughout my life, I’ve volunteered at a number of nursing homes and befriended several elders. I’d meet with them at a cafe or just chat on the phone. We’d talk about everything, from our personal lives to current events on the news. The elders I befriended were so excited to have these conversations. One woman told me that hearing me talk about my career and dating life brought excitement to her “otherwise boring life.” An elder man once told me that he enjoyed giving me life lessons, because it made him feel like he was “vicariously living life through me.” What I learned from my elder friends is the importance of having a sense of purpose as you get older. In an era where loneliness is a growing epidemic, many elders struggle with feeling ignored and unneeded by society. Had I not befriended elders, I would have never known how prevalent this was.</p><p>Speaking with children can help us see the endless possibilities in our world, while conversing with elders gives a glimpse into how we can live our lives to the fullest. Listening to these two demographics can help spark innovation about what is possible, as well as provide focus on what is ultimately important in the future.</p><h3>Turn your pain into purpose</h3><p>Perspective is the difference between those who see opportunity in moments of darkness versus those who only see the obstacles. Some people are able to come up with their most creative ideas after a painful experience. Many others turn their pain into purpose.</p><p>Here’s one example: who better than someone who has experienced rejection but persevered in the long-term to start a website called “From Rejection to Redirection” where people share their own success stories that happened as a result of rejection? In a world where social media often serves only to showcase people’s highlight reels, this may be a great source of motivation for many people.</p><p>Turning pain into purpose requires a change in perspective. Once you’ve mastered the ability to see opportunity in the darkness, you may be surprised at how many creative thoughts begin to flow through your mind!</p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Inspiration can come from the most unassuming or unlikely places.

Place them in another bowl. I’m sure you see where this is going!\nShake both bowls and pick out one note from each bowl. Read them together to get an idea for an innovative business model:\nUber for grandmas.\nOpentable for hospitals.\nTinder for introverts.\nNot all of them will make sense, but you might be surprised! And even if these phrases alone may not make complete sense, the game will get your creative juices flowing and can help you to come up with some brilliant ideas!\nExplain complicated ideas to foreigners\nMy father is an African American man who was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. My mother is a Japanese woman who was born and raised in a rural town in Japan. Because of their significant cultural and language differences, I grew up watching my parents find extremely creative ways to converse with one another on complicated subjects. When they were discussing the history of race relations in America, my father would use creative metaphors and illustrations to demonstrate concepts. He once even used the salt & pepper shakers at the dining room table to illustrate his point. Similarly, when explaining cultural norms within Japanese society, my mother would often use phonetics and inside jokes to help my father remember certain Japanese phrases.\nWhenever you’re in a situation where you must explain complicated subjects to foreigners (or anyone unfamiliar in your area of expertise), you will be surprised at how creative you can become. Applying this to your business model can help foster some incredibly innovative methods to communicate thoughts and ideas.\nCreative communication happens in all kinds of ways: a teacher using rap songs to teach math concepts, a dancer using her choreography to bring awareness to a social causes, and a black tech founder using virtual reality to bring awareness to workplace discrimination are just a few examples.\nHow would you explain the complex workings of your business to someone with no experience in the field? Get creative, and you may just find some new ideas you can utilize in your business!\nTalk to children and senior citizens\nI once asked an 8-year-old child what superpower she wished she had. She responded, “I wish I could turn into every animal at the zoo.”\nThat seemed pretty random. I asked her why.\nShe explained, “Because tigers are strong and alligators can breathe underwater and owls can fly and…” you get the idea.\nAs a 31-year-old data scientist working in corporate finance, I had grown entirely out of touch with what children find intriguing. But when I later dissected her response, I was inspired. The girl wanted to be all those animals so that she could have the unique abilities that each animal possesses. When I considered it even further, I realized that it speaks to a desire that many people have: the ability to have limitless abilities.\nCompanies like Udemy and other MOOCs were a game-changer, because they were addressing this exact desire — the desire to have no limits to self improvement. Self help books and productivity apps are also very popular, perhaps for similar reasons.\nSometimes children provide powerful messages on innovation through their playful delivery. When you get the opportunity, pay attention! You never know whether an offhanded remark from a child could spark your next great idea.\nThroughout my life, I’ve volunteered at a number of nursing homes and befriended several elders. I’d meet with them at a cafe or just chat on the phone. We’d talk about everything, from our personal lives to current events on the news. The elders I befriended were so excited to have these conversations. One woman told me that hearing me talk about my career and dating life brought excitement to her “otherwise boring life.” An elder man once told me that he enjoyed giving me life lessons, because it made him feel like he was “vicariously living life through me.” What I learned from my elder friends is the importance of having a sense of purpose as you get older. In an era where loneliness is a growing epidemic, many elders struggle with feeling ignored and unneeded by society. Had I not befriended elders, I would have never known how prevalent this was.\nSpeaking with children can help us see the endless possibilities in our world, while conversing with elders gives a glimpse into how we can live our lives to the fullest. Listening to these two demographics can help spark innovation about what is possible, as well as provide focus on what is ultimately important in the future.\nTurn your pain into purpose\nPerspective is the difference between those who see opportunity in moments of darkness versus those who only see the obstacles. Some people are able to come up with their most creative ideas after a painful experience. Many others turn their pain into purpose.\nHere’s one example: who better than someone who has experienced rejection but persevered in the long-term to start a website called “From Rejection to Redirection” where people share their own success stories that happened as a result of rejection? In a world where social media often serves only to showcase people’s highlight reels, this may be a great source of motivation for many people.\nTurning pain into purpose requires a change in perspective. Once you’ve mastered the ability to see opportunity in the darkness, you may be surprised at how many creative thoughts begin to flow through your mind!\nTakeaway\nInspiration can come from the most unassuming or unlikely places. As long as you maintain a sense of curiosity and the initiative to take action, you can generate innovative ideas for your business!\nYou can reach me at www.ayaspencer.com for more startup advice.

Threat actors have attacked critical zero-day flaws in the email software: an unrelenting cyber campaign that the US government has described as “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/06/microsoft-ioc-detection-tool-exchange-server-vulnerabilities\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/06/microsoft-ioc-detection-tool-exchange-server-vulnerabilities\" target=\"_blank\">widespread domestic and international exploitation</a>” that could affect hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Gaining visibility into an issue like this requires a full understanding of all assets connected to a company’s network. This type of continuous tracking of inventory doesn’t scale with how humans work, but machines can handle it easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For business executives with multiple, post-pandemic priorities, the time is now to start prioritizing security. “It’s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run,” observes Matt Kraning, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cortex Xpanse, an attack surface management software vendor recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might ask why companies don’t simply patch their systems and make these problems disappear. If only it were that simple. Unless businesses have implemented a way to find and keep track of their assets, that supposedly simple question is a head-scratcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But businesses have a tough time answering what seems like a straightforward question: namely, how many routers, servers, or assets do they have? If cybersecurity executives don’t know the answer, it’s impossible to then convey an accurate level of vulnerability to the board of directors. And if the board doesn’t understand the risk—and is blindsided by something even worse than the Exchange Server and 2020 SolarWinds attacks—well, the story almost writes itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why Kraning thinks it’s so important to create a minimum set of standards. And, he says, “Boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics.” Because without that level of understanding, boards aren’t asking the right questions—and cybersecurity executives aren’t having the right conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraning believes attack service management is a better way to secure companies with a continuous process of asset discovery, including the discovery of all assets exposed to the public internet—what he calls “unknown unknowns.” New assets can appear from anywhere at any time. “This is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that&#8217;s being developed,” Kraning says. “Once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward.” And that’s better for not just companies, but for the entire corporate ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Show notes and links:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceosurvey/2021.html?\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceosurvey/2021.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A leadership agenda to take on tomorrow</a>,” Global CEO Survey survey, PwC</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Full transcript</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel Ruma</em>: From MIT Technology Review, I&#8217;m Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our topic today is attack surface management. Where will your next cybersecurity breach come from? Enterprises have more and more things attached to their internet, including ever-expanding networks and aging infrastructure. And as attackers become more creative, executives will have to as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two words for you: unknown unknowns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guest is Matt Kraning, who is the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, which was recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks. Matt is an expert in large-scale optimization, distributed sensing, and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. Prior to co-founding Expanse, Matt worked for DARPA, including a deployment to Afghanistan. Matt holds PhD and master&#8217;s degrees from Stanford University. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks. Welcome, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt Kraning</em>: Thank you so much. Very happy to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: From the very beginning, you’ve been an expert in large-scale distributed sensing and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. How did that expertise lead you to co-found a company in the field of attack surface management?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Well, I&#8217;ll say a few things. Attack surface management is what we wound up calling it, but it was actually a very long journey to that and we didn&#8217;t really set out knowing that that&#8217;s exactly what it would be called or what precisely we would be doing. So there&#8217;s not even a Gartner category, which is a certain way of validating the existence for a market segment. That is actually still coming out. So the field of attack surface management, we actually invented ourselves. And a lot of invention means that there&#8217;s a lot of discovery going into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike a lot of enterprise security and IT companies where, in a lot of cases, most companies founded are usually going into an existing market—they&#8217;re doing usually an incremental or evolutionary advancement on top of what has already been invented—we actually took another approach and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really, with fresh eyes, asking, ‘What is not being served in the market today?’&#8221; And came up with the idea of, &#8220;Is the internet, with all of its promise, actually going to be a strategic liability for organizations, no longer just a strategic asset?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We developed a lot of techniques and technologies to basically look at all of the internet as a dataset: to gather, continuously, information about the internet, which is really where our backgrounds came in both from academia and then also from our work in the defense and intelligence communities, in places like DARPA, and at various places in the US intelligence agencies. And we said, actually, there seems to be a whole bunch of stuff broken on the internet, and surprisingly, a lot of it is actually associated with very large, very important companies. It was scratching on that question that actually led us to both founding Expanse and then also creating what would be the first and is the leading product in what is now known as attack surface management, which is really understanding all of the assets that you have, understanding the risks that they might pose and then also fixing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when we founded Expanse back in 2012, we didn&#8217;t know that it was going to be attack surface management. We didn&#8217;t even have the name attack surface management. Instead it was very problem-focused on, &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a lot of weird and dangerous things on the internet and a lot of security vulnerabilities. Let&#8217;s double-click on that a lot and actually see if there&#8217;s a way to build a business around that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: And how much the internet has changed in these nine short years, right? When you talk about that data set and in trying to find information of where the biggest security risks are, how hard was it to find? Did you look around and see, &#8220;Oh, look, there are entire datasets, you could track back easily to these companies. They&#8217;re leaking.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Things aren&#8217;t secure.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I love the phrase, &#8220;Everything is obvious once you know the answer.&#8221; I think initially one of the main challenges is that in order to even show how large this problem is, you actually need to gather the data. And gathering the data is not easy, especially on a continuous or regular basis, you actually have to have a lot of systems engineering background, a lot of distributed systems background to actually gather data on everything. I think what made our approach unique is that we actually said, &#8220;What if we gather data on every single system on the internet?&#8221; Which is actually enabled by a lot of both cost advantages enabled by things like cloud computing, but also software advantages both in open source and things that we would write ourselves. And then, rather than starting from things that you know about a company and trying to assess their risks, we said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we start with everything on the internet and then try to whittle it down to what is interesting?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of very good insights came out of that where again, almost by accident, we started discovering that we would actually find many, many more security problems than organizations actually knew about themselves. When I&#8217;m talking to organizations, I&#8217;m not talking to small businesses. I&#8217;m talking military services. I am talking Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 100 companies, Fortune 10 companies. Even the largest, most complex, but also the best finance, most elite customers had problems for security. And what really our discovery and our journey in creating the category, in creating attack surface management as an idea was that we find all of these security vulnerabilities and all of these assets in far-flung places anywhere on the internet, and they will occur for a multitude of reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was actually interesting because while the security challenges and security risks were very real, the real symptoms that we found, that we discovered, were actually that organizations did not have an effective means to track all of the assets that they had online and to simultaneously assess the security posture of those assets and to simultaneously fix and remediate and mitigate the risks of those opposed to the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that was one of the very interesting things was that looking back, we can now say, &#8220;Obviously, you want to do all of these activities.&#8221; But because we were actually doing something new that had never been done before, it was a new category, we had to discover all of that starting from the point of really, &#8220;There seems to be a lot of stuff broken on the internet. We don&#8217;t exactly know why, but let&#8217;s go investigate.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: That&#8217;s a good way of thinking of it, starting with a different place and then working your way backwards. So Matt, according to a recent PwC survey of more than 5,000 CEOs around the world, 47% are extremely concerned about cybersecurity. Now, 47% doesn&#8217;t sound like a large number to me, shouldn&#8217;t it be closer to 100%?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I would say that every CEO I’ve talked to is concerned about it on some level. And I think a lot depends on where they are. Overall, what we&#8217;ve noticed is a very large uptick, especially in the last five years, of the attentiveness of the CEOs and boards of directors to cybersecurity issues. Where I think we&#8217;ve seen a lag, though I think there are a few exceptions in this area, is that a lot of both tools and presentations that go, especially for executive audiences, for cybersecurity risks do not effectively convey everything that those people need to make effective decisions. And I think this is challenging for a variety of reasons, especially that a lot of CEOs and boards do not necessarily have the full technical background in order to do so. But I think it&#8217;s also been a failure to date in industry to be able to provide those tools. And I think we&#8217;re going to see more and more changes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I equate it to really the state of finance before Sarbanes-Oxley that basically started to require CEOs to get training, and boards as well, to start to understand certain financial metrics, to actually have certain controls in place. I think at the high level, we are going to have to see something like that in the coming years be implemented in some way to say that there are a minimum set of standards and that boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics. Right now, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people say, &#8220;I am concerned about this, but then I also don&#8217;t really know where to go next&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;m conversant. We got a report. We hired some firm. They had this presentation that had a whole bunch of PowerPoint slides with a lot of charts that would have Christmas tree lights that made my brain melt. And I could not really understand the concepts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think people get it, but we&#8217;re still in the early days of, How do you have effective controls over this? And then how do you actually have programs that are robust around it? Again, we need to move in that direction because more and more boards need to see this as a foundational aspect of their company, especially as pretty much all companies today, I don&#8217;t care what industry you&#8217;re in, what size, your company actually runs on IT. It&#8217;s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run. And as a result of the understanding of cybersecurity at those levels, with attack surface being now a part of that, is very important for organizations to be able to understand, because otherwise you will put your organization at a very large amount of risk by not being able to properly assess things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Yeah. And that gets back to the old adage, every company is a technology company. But maybe this is a more specific example of how it is. Could you briefly describe what attack surface management is, maybe perhaps for that executive audience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: The way that we describe attack surface management is it&#8217;s effectively a three-step process where all steps are done continuously in the form of cycle, but it is a process and procedure by which you, or really a vendor, in this case Expanse or Palo Alto Networks, continuously discover all assets that an organization has. In our case, from external attack surface, all assets that you have on the public internet. And that is a continuous process because at any given time, and I can go into this later, but at any given time, new assets could appear from anywhere on the internet. So you need to have a continuous discovery process that says, &#8220;At any given time, I might not know everything about my assets so I should have mechanisms to gather information about anywhere that they could be and try to associate them to my organization.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time as soon as an asset is discovered, you have to have means to evaluate it across a variety of different characteristics. In many cases, if I&#8217;ve discovered a new asset, is this asset actually truly new? And if it is not, then matching, normalizing, deduplicating that with other things. If it is a new asset, then in most cases, it&#8217;s actually going to be unmanaged. So how do I actually start a slew of activities to say, &#8220;This is an asset that exists with mine, but it usually exists outside of an intended set of security controls. So how do I start a process to both assess what controls need to be put in place and then bring it under management.&#8221; And the third part of evaluation is also understanding what is the risk that this poses immediately to my organization to help me prioritize activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final step is what we call mitigation. Once you&#8217;ve evaluated everything that you&#8217;ve discovered, what do you actually do about it? What actions do you take and how do you do so in highly automated and effective ways. And for us, there are two primary steps that mitigation involves. I mentioned prioritization, but it&#8217;s one, bringing systems under management. In a lot of cases, what that also means is that for most systems associated with our large customers, it actually means taking them either off the internet directly, so we&#8217;re putting them behind a VPN or other sort of corporate device, or making sure that they are then known and then up-to-date because in a lot of cases, the real symptom of security problems that we find happens to be around the fact that an asset was just unmanaged for a very long time and may contain security vulnerabilities that were later discovered simply because you would have security patches that exist for known security issues that had not been applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain cases, such as zero-day attacks, it&#8217;s actually just much more important to know where all the assets are so you can patch them as soon as possible. But for the larger majority of assets that we discover for our customers and help manage their attack surface, the real problem is that the assets are just not known. And for executives, the real key is that the existing processes and tools that a lot of companies use can be very good from this certain side of security, but they assume that networks are effectively a lot more static.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So what are the ramifications of an enterprise not knowing their actual attack surface?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: The large, most obvious one is an increased risk of breach. I think it was an adage throughout a lot of the 2000s, helped on in no small part by vendors, that everything started from email phishing. And there&#8217;s very, very large email security vendors that still pumped this message that it&#8217;s every single security incident is effectively a phishing email and that humans are the weakest link when they&#8217;re clicking on things, and therefore buy more email security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s wrong. I think it&#8217;s actually correct that security is a big thing, you can buy it. But it&#8217;s also much easier to mitigate especially now with a lot of good tools, like you actually have full visibility over all emails being sent to employees because they have to go through a central mail server. It&#8217;s actually a question of just being able to detect bad things but not actually needing to find out that there were, say, emails being sent that you didn&#8217;t have visibility into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in contrast, what we&#8217;ve seen, especially more recently over the last decade and really even the last five years, is some of the absolute worst breaches, the ones that cause hundreds of millions to billions of dollars damage, are not coming from phishing. They are actually coming from usually unknown and unmonitored assets and that in many cases, were actually on the public internet. So I think some of the largest examples of this are actually things like the WannaCry attack, which caused, it&#8217;s estimated over $10 billion worldwide in damage, shut down entire companies, putting most of the health-care system of the United Kingdom back on pen and paper for actual days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the real ramifications are, you have all these extra avenues to get in because there are so many more assets that are online that are not being tracked by organizations, and that is actually how attackers are getting in because it turns out that there are very efficient, automated ways for attackers to understand and probe for and exploit these attacks surfaces. And the ramifications are quite bold. You see most of the healthcare of a first-world country reduced to pen and paper for days. Very, very serious because it&#8217;s not just hacking someone&#8217;s email, it&#8217;s actually hacking the critical infrastructure of the network itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Speaking of critical infrastructure, another recent attack is the water treatment plant in Florida, where an attacker was able to remotely change the chemical makeup of the water to add lye to it, which could have poisoned an entire community. So then, infrastructure is an enormous issue for very large companies, like water treatment plants or oil and gas companies, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Absolutely. In that case, to the best of my understanding, the attack vector there was actually a remote access server that someone at that plant left open, was on the internet, and allowed someone to go in. What our tech services are about is we&#8217;re finding ways in that are effectively tools of IT convenience but that are able to be subverted by attackers because the tools of IT convenience are not hardened to the same degree as other things that are meant to be on the internet and are left out as a matter of course. We have this line that we like to view the internet in most ways as what most of us experienced through our web browsers or on our phone. It&#8217;s this really nice setup consumer experience and all of the webpages we view looks very nice and pleasing and we go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a good analogy to the physical world like I guess, soon after we&#8217;re all vaccinated from covid-19, we&#8217;ll be back shopping outside. You might go to a Starbucks and the store is really nice, you have this great experience, you get your latte, you go out, but then if you look beneath all of the glitz on the streets, you actually have much older infrastructure. You have things like no sewer pipes and other things that are greasy and cracking. And that&#8217;s the infrastructure that supports the more beautiful world on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of what we see as part of attack surface is an IT analogy that most people view the internet really as just, &#8220;What&#8217;s in their web browser? What&#8217;s on the phone, these nice consumer websites?&#8221; But there&#8217;s entire backend IT infrastructure that supports that. And it&#8217;s somewhat creaky and it&#8217;s not always well-configured. Without something like ASM, you have problems that you don&#8217;t actually know the state of your network because it&#8217;s so large, distributed, and complex. And as in the case with Florida, which by the way was a smaller organization, it goes to the heart of how do you know that something is not going on? Under any IT security policy, having a remote access service on the internet should not be allowed. But it&#8217;s very hard even for smaller organizations to get that continuous visibility of, what do I actually look like from the outside? What do I look like to an attacker with legacy tools?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: And that&#8217;s a good example of an attack that&#8217;s not a phishing attack. It has nothing to do with the email. While we&#8217;re on the discussion of attacks, most memorably this year again, SolarWinds and Exchange, how would implementing ASM have changed those outcomes for organizations? Or how about those lucky organizations that actually understood their attack surface management options and were able to find this and thwart the attack?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I&#8217;ll speak to both because a number of our customers had both of those kinds of systems and we helped them respond. I think the Microsoft Exchange hacks, and for your listeners, a bit of background: there was actually a set of zero-days announced for the sets of versions of the Microsoft Exchange email services earlier in February and March of this year. Very, very dangerous because in effect, these are the mail servers of an organization and if you followed this XY chain, what it basically allowed you to do was send a message to a mail server to grant you effectively unfettered administrative access to the entire mail server. And there were actually hundreds of thousands of these that we detected online. And effectively, if you think about it, having an attacker being able to download all or most of the corporate mail server and with all of these sensitive information that&#8217;s stored there, is a very serious attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we noticed were actually two things, which was, for large organizations, they were very aware of this and they were patching very, very rapidly. But there were a number of customers that we were able to help where they&#8217;re so large that they actually don&#8217;t even have one central set of mail servers. So without Expanse, they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to find even all of their mail servers and be able to patch them in time because they are so distributed, they actually needed an inventory of even their mail servers. And it&#8217;s very hard to aggregate that in one central way unless you&#8217;re using an ASM tool like Expanse. Because instead, in a lot of cases, you&#8217;re usually using Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Excel. You&#8217;re going to be sending emails to different business units. You&#8217;re going to be asking IT leaders in those different business units. If they&#8217;re patched, they will be sending emails and spreadsheets back. It&#8217;s a very, very manual process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So able to actually identify that and really help them in a very short order of, like, a day, find and be able to fix every single server they had on their estate, which we think really, really changed the outcome, because they could have been vulnerable for weeks in certain cases. For SolarWinds as well, I think the details are a bit different because not all SolarWinds assets are necessarily exposed to the internet. And also in a lot of cases, they&#8217;d been there for months. As part of broader Palo Alto, we had other products that were able to stop SolarWinds: the SolarWinds attack in particular, our endpoint framework called XDR. But even there for SolarWinds, once the attack was known, customers still have the problem of, they didn&#8217;t even know where all of their SolarWinds servers were, which again goes back to this inventory problem and choosing capabilities, both like Expanse and other capabilities we now have as part of Palo Alto, we were able to actually help customers very rapidly understand everywhere they had a SolarWinds exposure so that they could mitigate that very quickly. So there was effectively a two-step process. At Palo Alto, we were able to prevent the attack on our customers even without knowing that the supply chain had been breached. And then once it was more public, we were actually able to then also help everyone identify all of the servers that they had and make sure that they were all up to date and not infected with the supply-chain Trojan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: That&#8217;s really interesting because some companies may be thinking, &#8220;Oh, well, we don&#8217;t have water plants and aging infrastructure to worry about.&#8221; But do you actually know where all your mail is stored and how many different servers it may be on and different cloud instances or wherever? And when you do only have a matter of hours to make this critical patch, how quickly can you do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Exactly. And a lot of the questions that I asked our customers are just, &#8220;How do you have confidence that, effectively, your systems are up to date?&#8221; Answering even seemingly basic sounding questions with existing IT, if you don&#8217;t have Expanse or ASM, is actually surprisingly hard. I&#8217;ll give another fun example. I ask chief information security officers this all the time: &#8220;How many routers does your organization have?&#8221; It seems like a pretty basic question, seems like they’d know, at least to a very good approximation, the IT team should probably know exactly how many routers they have. They&#8217;re very important pieces of networking equipment, especially at the enterprise level, they&#8217;re more expensive. So it&#8217;s not just like that home Wi-Fi hotspot that we&#8217;re used to. These things can cost tens, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars to handle enterprise-grade workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we find is that when you ask that question, there&#8217;s actually usually not one central place where all that&#8217;s tracked. Instead, it will be tracked by local development and IT teams in different ways. It will be tracked in multiple spreadsheets. There may be certain local IT management systems that know that, but at the end of it, if you said like, &#8220;How many routers do you have right now?&#8221; The process that they would use to answer that is not going into a system or logging in, it&#8217;s actually starting an email chain. That&#8217;s actually the one of the main problems that attack surface management attempts to solve, is, How do you have an accurate and up-to-date inventory of everything so that you can then build a variety of processes on top of that, including security? But if you don&#8217;t have an up-to-date inventory or you think you do, but you don&#8217;t, then when you start to pull on that thread, a lot of business processes, a lot of IT processes, a lot of security processes that you want to have apply across your entire enterprise, all of a sudden you&#8217;re realizing, &#8220;Wait, this actually is only being partially implemented because if I don&#8217;t have a full inventory, how do I actually know what&#8217;s going over all of my assets as opposed to just the assets I know about?&#8221; And that&#8217;s what we talk about when we say “unknown unknowns.” As you mentioned at the top, it&#8217;s, &#8220;I know some degree of my systems, but do I know all of them?&#8221; That delta can be everything for organizations because most of their risk is in the parts of their network they did not even know to investigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: What other data-driven decisions can be made from this sort of focus on actually knowing where all your assets are. How else can this help the business?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Two areas that this really helps organizations with is actually cloud governance and M&amp;A. Particularly, these are very sprawling enterprises. So for a lot of our customers, they might actually have hundreds of different cloud accounts in the public cloud providers, so AWS, Azure, Oracle, Google, Alibaba in a lot of cases, and they had no way to actually rationalize this because they would have a whole bunch of different development teams and they couldn&#8217;t get something. And so, when they say that they are moving to the cloud, a typical refrain from our customers will be like, &#8220;Yes, we are. We have deals with Amazon and we&#8217;re hedging our bets a little bit. We&#8217;re also exploring Azure so we&#8217;re not solely locked into one cloud.&#8221; What we find is that the average customer for Expanse is in 11 different infrastructure providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not talking SaaS, I&#8217;m talking in places that you actually get like renting a server, putting data on yourself. It&#8217;s amazing and astronomical and we could say, &#8220;Well, yeah, you are on Azure. You&#8217;re also on AWS. Did you know that you&#8217;re also in DigitalOcean? You&#8217;re also in Linode. Your general manager in Europe probably put you in OVH or Orange hosting. You have something else in the Malaysian data center. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what that is.” And that&#8217;s typical. One customer for us was actually in over a hundred different providers because they&#8217;re a very large multinational. I think that&#8217;s when we see that people&#8217;s cloud governance plans versus cloud reality are dramatically different. And helping them with that will enable them to move both securely and quickly to the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second one is mergers and acquisitions. I think this is something that is increasingly happening. As a lot of industries are consolidating, there&#8217;s a lot of M&amp;A activity more recently. But when you think about it, an M&amp;A is one of the largest IT change events an organization can have, especially if it&#8217;s a large acquisition. So I know a little bit about this, having recently gone through this process with Palo Alto Networks on ourselves on the other side of the table, but the number of things you have to integrate is quite large. And in the case of Expanse, we&#8217;re integrated with a top security company in the world and also we are relatively small. So the integration headaches have been almost nonexistent, and it&#8217;s been a really great process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for larger organizations where you might, an organization with 50,000 people is acquiring an organization with 10,000 people, the number of different steps you have to go through, the amount of IT that you have to transfer, the amount of legacy that you have to understand is gigantic. And in a lot of ways, these are in many cases only partially implemented because as an acquirer, you might not even know where all the assets you&#8217;re acquiring are. As an example, for an airline, there was a series of mergers and we&#8217;re actually able to find assets of the merged airline that no longer exists, but were still on the internet more than a decade after the merger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which gives you an idea of just how long some of these things take. That&#8217;s the other side of, how we really help with our customers, is actually understanding, &#8220;When you actually acquire an asset, how do you actually complete that process? How do you measure it? How do you monitor it and how do you do that at the scale of the internet rather than with a lot of consultants, Excel spreadsheets, pieces of paper and emails?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So from our conversation today, I feel like this is the, “If you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, you should really figure it out” warning, if you haven&#8217;t heard it before. But there are glimmers of hope in this, right? Because if the asset exists, you can at least find it, track it and assess what you&#8217;re going to do with it, mediate any changes you need to make or assess it to bring it back to full cybersecurity compliance. What gives you hope about what&#8217;s possible after seeing the first three months of this year and what&#8217;s happened with attacks, the ongoing issues that we&#8217;re going to have? But there is opportunity there, right? There is hope. What are you seeing that makes you optimistic about cybersecurity and what we&#8217;re looking forward to in the next five years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m actually quite optimistic in not even the long-term but even in the medium term I think, even three, four years out. Near-term, definitely there&#8217;s going to be some rough seas ahead, but here&#8217;s what makes me most optimistic. One, I think that this is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that&#8217;s being developed. And by that, it is clear that once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward. There&#8217;s a lot of mechanistic steps to get better at that. There&#8217;s a lot of automations that can be put on that. And there&#8217;s a lot of things coming to bear. But in many cases, the actual hard part is seeing what you actually need to fix and knowing all of the set of problems and then being able to prioritize them effectively and then start working on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think in particular, the things that I&#8217;ve seen are within the industry, I think there are a lot of technologies in the few years that are going to meet the marketing hype that has been around for years. I talk a lot with industry partners. We use substantial amounts of data. With my background where I have a PhD from Stanford in operations research and machine learning, we actually do use some real actual machine learning in our products. We also use a lot of heuristics as well. I joke that we sometimes have machine learning classifiers to solve a problem. Other times we have SQL queries that solve the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have some really well-written SQL queries. I&#8217;m very proud of those. But I think that the industry itself, especially in marketing material, you would think that everything in cybersecurity is this automated AI, ML-enabled everything. In most cases, but not all, but in a lot across the industry, and this is especially true in startups, it’s just a line to pitch. And what companies really call AI are just standard software rules and there&#8217;s really nothing special going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or there&#8217;s an old joke that, &#8220;Oh, I have this great AI thing. What is it? Well, we have a bunch of analysts that are former intelligence officers, usually in Maryland or outside of Tel Aviv and they&#8217;re the ones doing everything. But we have a system that efficiently routes work to them and that&#8217;s our AI.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, that&#8217;s people.&#8221; I think what I&#8217;ve seen is that one, automation broadly defined is a real thing. But automation actually means on the ground, is you take something that previously took hours and days and 10 people. And then with software right now, it&#8217;s more so how do you take that down to 15 minutes and two or three people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that we&#8217;re going to see even larger gains or even start to take humans out of the loop entirely in certain business processes. And I think what we&#8217;re seeing and this is a lot of what we&#8217;re working on and I&#8217;m working on now is that over the next months and years, actual large-scale machine learning capability is actually being deployed in production. I think there are some that are out there in piecemeal. There&#8217;s a lot more rules than anyone wants to talk about, but we are now seeing there&#8217;s enough assemblage of data, there&#8217;s enough normalization of data in that, especially at the larger companies, and that enterprises are more willing to share information with vendors if it demonstrably improves the security service that they are getting, that we are actually going to be able to deploy increasingly sophisticated capabilities along those lines and have the product/reality match. I think that’s what at least the broader industry marketing zeitgeist had been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of them, they are very, very real and they&#8217;re very much coming. And they&#8217;re coming at an industrial scale for defenders. And I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most excited about because despite the fact that there&#8217;s the old adage of, attackers need to be right once, defenders need to be right all the time, increasingly, it is now more scalable for defenders to be right much of the time and to actually set up very vast monitoring networks so that if the attackers slip up once, the defenders can completely wipe them out in that attack. And that both asymmetrically affects cost and also I think will help tilt the field back to defense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I think when you had partial AI solutions and ML solutions and partial automation, it helped attackers much more because they could duct-tape together a few different parts, scale up certain things very highly and then just see what came back to them in a great way. I think defenders are going to be able to have similar capabilities that are effective because they actually cover everything going on in an enterprise. And that&#8217;s going to allow us to turn the tide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>:Matt, thank you so much for joining us today in what has been a fantastic conversation on the Business Lab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was Matt Kraning, the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, who I spoke with from Cambridge, Massachusetts, the home of MIT and MIT Technology Review, overlooking the Charles River.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it for this episode of Business Lab.

Threat actors have attacked critical zero-day flaws in the email software: an unrelenting cyber campaign that the US government has described as “widespread domestic and international exploitation” that could affect hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Gaining visibility into an issue like this requires a full understanding of all assets connected to a company’s network. This type of continuous tracking of inventory doesn’t scale with how humans work, but machines can handle it easily.\nFor business executives with multiple, post-pandemic priorities, the time is now to start prioritizing security. “It’s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run,” observes Matt Kraning, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cortex Xpanse, an attack surface management software vendor recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks.\nYou might ask why companies don’t simply patch their systems and make these problems disappear. If only it were that simple. Unless businesses have implemented a way to find and keep track of their assets, that supposedly simple question is a head-scratcher.\nBut businesses have a tough time answering what seems like a straightforward question: namely, how many routers, servers, or assets do they have? If cybersecurity executives don’t know the answer, it’s impossible to then convey an accurate level of vulnerability to the board of directors. And if the board doesn’t understand the risk—and is blindsided by something even worse than the Exchange Server and 2020 SolarWinds attacks—well, the story almost writes itself.\nThat’s why Kraning thinks it’s so important to create a minimum set of standards. And, he says, “Boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics.” Because without that level of understanding, boards aren’t asking the right questions—and cybersecurity executives aren’t having the right conversations.\nKraning believes attack service management is a better way to secure companies with a continuous process of asset discovery, including the discovery of all assets exposed to the public internet—what he calls “unknown unknowns.” New assets can appear from anywhere at any time. “This is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that’s being developed,” Kraning says. “Once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward.” And that’s better for not just companies, but for the entire corporate ecosystem.\nShow notes and links:\n“A leadership agenda to take on tomorrow,” Global CEO Survey survey, PwC\nFull transcript\nLaurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I’m Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.\nOur topic today is attack surface management. Where will your next cybersecurity breach come from? Enterprises have more and more things attached to their internet, including ever-expanding networks and aging infrastructure. And as attackers become more creative, executives will have to as well.\nTwo words for you: unknown unknowns.\nMy guest is Matt Kraning, who is the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, which was recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks. Matt is an expert in large-scale optimization, distributed sensing, and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. Prior to co-founding Expanse, Matt worked for DARPA, including a deployment to Afghanistan. Matt holds PhD and master’s degrees from Stanford University. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks. Welcome, Matt.\nMatt Kraning: Thank you so much. Very happy to be here.\nLaurel: From the very beginning, you’ve been an expert in large-scale distributed sensing and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. How did that expertise lead you to co-found a company in the field of attack surface management?\nMatt: Well, I’ll say a few things. Attack surface management is what we wound up calling it, but it was actually a very long journey to that and we didn’t really set out knowing that that’s exactly what it would be called or what precisely we would be doing. So there’s not even a Gartner category, which is a certain way of validating the existence for a market segment. That is actually still coming out. So the field of attack surface management, we actually invented ourselves. And a lot of invention means that there’s a lot of discovery going into that.\nUnlike a lot of enterprise security and IT companies where, in a lot of cases, most companies founded are usually going into an existing market—they’re doing usually an incremental or evolutionary advancement on top of what has already been invented—we actually took another approach and said, “We’re really, with fresh eyes, asking, ‘What is not being served in the market today?’” And came up with the idea of, “Is the internet, with all of its promise, actually going to be a strategic liability for organizations, no longer just a strategic asset?”\nWe developed a lot of techniques and technologies to basically look at all of the internet as a dataset: to gather, continuously, information about the internet, which is really where our backgrounds came in both from academia and then also from our work in the defense and intelligence communities, in places like DARPA, and at various places in the US intelligence agencies. And we said, actually, there seems to be a whole bunch of stuff broken on the internet, and surprisingly, a lot of it is actually associated with very large, very important companies. It was scratching on that question that actually led us to both founding Expanse and then also creating what would be the first and is the leading product in what is now known as attack surface management, which is really understanding all of the assets that you have, understanding the risks that they might pose and then also fixing problems.\nBut when we founded Expanse back in 2012, we didn’t know that it was going to be attack surface management. We didn’t even have the name attack surface management. Instead it was very problem-focused on, “We’re seeing a lot of weird and dangerous things on the internet and a lot of security vulnerabilities. Let’s double-click on that a lot and actually see if there’s a way to build a business around that.”\nLaurel: And how much the internet has changed in these nine short years, right? When you talk about that data set and in trying to find information of where the biggest security risks are, how hard was it to find? Did you look around and see, “Oh, look, there are entire datasets, you could track back easily to these companies. They’re leaking.” Or, “Things aren’t secure.”\nMatt: I love the phrase, “Everything is obvious once you know the answer.” I think initially one of the main challenges is that in order to even show how large this problem is, you actually need to gather the data. And gathering the data is not easy, especially on a continuous or regular basis, you actually have to have a lot of systems engineering background, a lot of distributed systems background to actually gather data on everything. I think what made our approach unique is that we actually said, “What if we gather data on every single system on the internet?” Which is actually enabled by a lot of both cost advantages enabled by things like cloud computing, but also software advantages both in open source and things that we would write ourselves. And then, rather than starting from things that you know about a company and trying to assess their risks, we said, “Why don’t we start with everything on the internet and then try to whittle it down to what is interesting?”\nAnd a lot of very good insights came out of that where again, almost by accident, we started discovering that we would actually find many, many more security problems than organizations actually knew about themselves. When I’m talking to organizations, I’m not talking to small businesses. I’m talking military services. I am talking Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 100 companies, Fortune 10 companies. Even the largest, most complex, but also the best finance, most elite customers had problems for security. And what really our discovery and our journey in creating the category, in creating attack surface management as an idea was that we find all of these security vulnerabilities and all of these assets in far-flung places anywhere on the internet, and they will occur for a multitude of reasons.\nBut it was actually interesting because while the security challenges and security risks were very real, the real symptoms that we found, that we discovered, were actually that organizations did not have an effective means to track all of the assets that they had online and to simultaneously assess the security posture of those assets and to simultaneously fix and remediate and mitigate the risks of those opposed to the organization.\nAnd I think that was one of the very interesting things was that looking back, we can now say, “Obviously, you want to do all of these activities.” But because we were actually doing something new that had never been done before, it was a new category, we had to discover all of that starting from the point of really, “There seems to be a lot of stuff broken on the internet. We don’t exactly know why, but let’s go investigate.”\nLaurel: That’s a good way of thinking of it, starting with a different place and then working your way backwards. So Matt, according to a recent PwC survey of more than 5,000 CEOs around the world, 47% are extremely concerned about cybersecurity. Now, 47% doesn’t sound like a large number to me, shouldn’t it be closer to 100%?\nMatt: I would say that every CEO I’ve talked to is concerned about it on some level. And I think a lot depends on where they are. Overall, what we’ve noticed is a very large uptick, especially in the last five years, of the attentiveness of the CEOs and boards of directors to cybersecurity issues. Where I think we’ve seen a lag, though I think there are a few exceptions in this area, is that a lot of both tools and presentations that go, especially for executive audiences, for cybersecurity risks do not effectively convey everything that those people need to make effective decisions. And I think this is challenging for a variety of reasons, especially that a lot of CEOs and boards do not necessarily have the full technical background in order to do so. But I think it’s also been a failure to date in industry to be able to provide those tools. And I think we’re going to see more and more changes there.\nI equate it to really the state of finance before Sarbanes-Oxley that basically started to require CEOs to get training, and boards as well, to start to understand certain financial metrics, to actually have certain controls in place. I think at the high level, we are going to have to see something like that in the coming years be implemented in some way to say that there are a minimum set of standards and that boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics. Right now, I’ve seen a lot of people say, “I am concerned about this, but then I also don’t really know where to go next” or, “I’m conversant. We got a report. We hired some firm. They had this presentation that had a whole bunch of PowerPoint slides with a lot of charts that would have Christmas tree lights that made my brain melt. And I could not really understand the concepts.”\nI think people get it, but we’re still in the early days of, How do you have effective controls over this? And then how do you actually have programs that are robust around it? Again, we need to move in that direction because more and more boards need to see this as a foundational aspect of their company, especially as pretty much all companies today, I don’t care what industry you’re in, what size, your company actually runs on IT. It’s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run. And as a result of the understanding of cybersecurity at those levels, with attack surface being now a part of that, is very important for organizations to be able to understand, because otherwise you will put your organization at a very large amount of risk by not being able to properly assess things like that.\nLaurel: Yeah. And that gets back to the old adage, every company is a technology company. But maybe this is a more specific example of how it is. Could you briefly describe what attack surface management is, maybe perhaps for that executive audience?\nMatt: The way that we describe attack surface management is it’s effectively a three-step process where all steps are done continuously in the form of cycle, but it is a process and procedure by which you, or really a vendor, in this case Expanse or Palo Alto Networks, continuously discover all assets that an organization has. In our case, from external attack surface, all assets that you have on the public internet. And that is a continuous process because at any given time, and I can go into this later, but at any given time, new assets could appear from anywhere on the internet. So you need to have a continuous discovery process that says, “At any given time, I might not know everything about my assets so I should have mechanisms to gather information about anywhere that they could be and try to associate them to my organization.”\nAt the same time as soon as an asset is discovered, you have to have means to evaluate it across a variety of different characteristics. In many cases, if I’ve discovered a new asset, is this asset actually truly new? And if it is not, then matching, normalizing, deduplicating that with other things. If it is a new asset, then in most cases, it’s actually going to be unmanaged. So how do I actually start a slew of activities to say, “This is an asset that exists with mine, but it usually exists outside of an intended set of security controls. So how do I start a process to both assess what controls need to be put in place and then bring it under management.” And the third part of evaluation is also understanding what is the risk that this poses immediately to my organization to help me prioritize activities.\nThe final step is what we call mitigation. Once you’ve evaluated everything that you’ve discovered, what do you actually do about it? What actions do you take and how do you do so in highly automated and effective ways. And for us, there are two primary steps that mitigation involves. I mentioned prioritization, but it’s one, bringing systems under management. In a lot of cases, what that also means is that for most systems associated with our large customers, it actually means taking them either off the internet directly, so we’re putting them behind a VPN or other sort of corporate device, or making sure that they are then known and then up-to-date because in a lot of cases, the real symptom of security problems that we find happens to be around the fact that an asset was just unmanaged for a very long time and may contain security vulnerabilities that were later discovered simply because you would have security patches that exist for known security issues that had not been applied.\nIn certain cases, such as zero-day attacks, it’s actually just much more important to know where all the assets are so you can patch them as soon as possible. But for the larger majority of assets that we discover for our customers and help manage their attack surface, the real problem is that the assets are just not known. And for executives, the real key is that the existing processes and tools that a lot of companies use can be very good from this certain side of security, but they assume that networks are effectively a lot more static.\nLaurel: So what are the ramifications of an enterprise not knowing their actual attack surface?\nMatt: The large, most obvious one is an increased risk of breach. I think it was an adage throughout a lot of the 2000s, helped on in no small part by vendors, that everything started from email phishing. And there’s very, very large email security vendors that still pumped this message that it’s every single security incident is effectively a phishing email and that humans are the weakest link when they’re clicking on things, and therefore buy more email security.\nI don’t think that’s wrong. I think it’s actually correct that security is a big thing, you can buy it. But it’s also much easier to mitigate especially now with a lot of good tools, like you actually have full visibility over all emails being sent to employees because they have to go through a central mail server. It’s actually a question of just being able to detect bad things but not actually needing to find out that there were, say, emails being sent that you didn’t have visibility into.\nI think in contrast, what we’ve seen, especially more recently over the last decade and really even the last five years, is some of the absolute worst breaches, the ones that cause hundreds of millions to billions of dollars damage, are not coming from phishing. They are actually coming from usually unknown and unmonitored assets and that in many cases, were actually on the public internet. So I think some of the largest examples of this are actually things like the WannaCry attack, which caused, it’s estimated over $10 billion worldwide in damage, shut down entire companies, putting most of the health-care system of the United Kingdom back on pen and paper for actual days.\nAnd the real ramifications are, you have all these extra avenues to get in because there are so many more assets that are online that are not being tracked by organizations, and that is actually how attackers are getting in because it turns out that there are very efficient, automated ways for attackers to understand and probe for and exploit these attacks surfaces. And the ramifications are quite bold. You see most of the healthcare of a first-world country reduced to pen and paper for days. Very, very serious because it’s not just hacking someone’s email, it’s actually hacking the critical infrastructure of the network itself.\nLaurel: Speaking of critical infrastructure, another recent attack is the water treatment plant in Florida, where an attacker was able to remotely change the chemical makeup of the water to add lye to it, which could have poisoned an entire community. So then, infrastructure is an enormous issue for very large companies, like water treatment plants or oil and gas companies, etc.?\nMatt: Absolutely. In that case, to the best of my understanding, the attack vector there was actually a remote access server that someone at that plant left open, was on the internet, and allowed someone to go in. What our tech services are about is we’re finding ways in that are effectively tools of IT convenience but that are able to be subverted by attackers because the tools of IT convenience are not hardened to the same degree as other things that are meant to be on the internet and are left out as a matter of course. We have this line that we like to view the internet in most ways as what most of us experienced through our web browsers or on our phone. It’s this really nice setup consumer experience and all of the webpages we view looks very nice and pleasing and we go there.\nAnd it’s a good analogy to the physical world like I guess, soon after we’re all vaccinated from covid-19, we’ll be back shopping outside. You might go to a Starbucks and the store is really nice, you have this great experience, you get your latte, you go out, but then if you look beneath all of the glitz on the streets, you actually have much older infrastructure. You have things like no sewer pipes and other things that are greasy and cracking. And that’s the infrastructure that supports the more beautiful world on top.\nA lot of what we see as part of attack surface is an IT analogy that most people view the internet really as just, “What’s in their web browser? What’s on the phone, these nice consumer websites?” But there’s entire backend IT infrastructure that supports that. And it’s somewhat creaky and it’s not always well-configured. Without something like ASM, you have problems that you don’t actually know the state of your network because it’s so large, distributed, and complex. And as in the case with Florida, which by the way was a smaller organization, it goes to the heart of how do you know that something is not going on? Under any IT security policy, having a remote access service on the internet should not be allowed. But it’s very hard even for smaller organizations to get that continuous visibility of, what do I actually look like from the outside? What do I look like to an attacker with legacy tools?\nLaurel: And that’s a good example of an attack that’s not a phishing attack. It has nothing to do with the email. While we’re on the discussion of attacks, most memorably this year again, SolarWinds and Exchange, how would implementing ASM have changed those outcomes for organizations? Or how about those lucky organizations that actually understood their attack surface management options and were able to find this and thwart the attack?\nMatt: I’ll speak to both because a number of our customers had both of those kinds of systems and we helped them respond. I think the Microsoft Exchange hacks, and for your listeners, a bit of background: there was actually a set of zero-days announced for the sets of versions of the Microsoft Exchange email services earlier in February and March of this year. Very, very dangerous because in effect, these are the mail servers of an organization and if you followed this XY chain, what it basically allowed you to do was send a message to a mail server to grant you effectively unfettered administrative access to the entire mail server. And there were actually hundreds of thousands of these that we detected online. And effectively, if you think about it, having an attacker being able to download all or most of the corporate mail server and with all of these sensitive information that’s stored there, is a very serious attack.\nSo what we noticed were actually two things, which was, for large organizations, they were very aware of this and they were patching very, very rapidly. But there were a number of customers that we were able to help where they’re so large that they actually don’t even have one central set of mail servers. So without Expanse, they wouldn’t have been able to find even all of their mail servers and be able to patch them in time because they are so distributed, they actually needed an inventory of even their mail servers. And it’s very hard to aggregate that in one central way unless you’re using an ASM tool like Expanse. Because instead, in a lot of cases, you’re usually using Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Excel. You’re going to be sending emails to different business units. You’re going to be asking IT leaders in those different business units. If they’re patched, they will be sending emails and spreadsheets back. It’s a very, very manual process.\nSo able to actually identify that and really help them in a very short order of, like, a day, find and be able to fix every single server they had on their estate, which we think really, really changed the outcome, because they could have been vulnerable for weeks in certain cases. For SolarWinds as well, I think the details are a bit different because not all SolarWinds assets are necessarily exposed to the internet. And also in a lot of cases, they’d been there for months. As part of broader Palo Alto, we had other products that were able to stop SolarWinds: the SolarWinds attack in particular, our endpoint framework called XDR. But even there for SolarWinds, once the attack was known, customers still have the problem of, they didn’t even know where all of their SolarWinds servers were, which again goes back to this inventory problem and choosing capabilities, both like Expanse and other capabilities we now have as part of Palo Alto, we were able to actually help customers very rapidly understand everywhere they had a SolarWinds exposure so that they could mitigate that very quickly. So there was effectively a two-step process. At Palo Alto, we were able to prevent the attack on our customers even without knowing that the supply chain had been breached. And then once it was more public, we were actually able to then also help everyone identify all of the servers that they had and make sure that they were all up to date and not infected with the supply-chain Trojan.\nLaurel: That’s really interesting because some companies may be thinking, “Oh, well, we don’t have water plants and aging infrastructure to worry about.” But do you actually know where all your mail is stored and how many different servers it may be on and different cloud instances or wherever? And when you do only have a matter of hours to make this critical patch, how quickly can you do it?\nMatt: Exactly. And a lot of the questions that I asked our customers are just, “How do you have confidence that, effectively, your systems are up to date?” Answering even seemingly basic sounding questions with existing IT, if you don’t have Expanse or ASM, is actually surprisingly hard. I’ll give another fun example. I ask chief information security officers this all the time: “How many routers does your organization have?” It seems like a pretty basic question, seems like they’d know, at least to a very good approximation, the IT team should probably know exactly how many routers they have. They’re very important pieces of networking equipment, especially at the enterprise level, they’re more expensive. So it’s not just like that home Wi-Fi hotspot that we’re used to. These things can cost tens, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars to handle enterprise-grade workloads.\nAnd what we find is that when you ask that question, there’s actually usually not one central place where all that’s tracked. Instead, it will be tracked by local development and IT teams in different ways. It will be tracked in multiple spreadsheets. There may be certain local IT management systems that know that, but at the end of it, if you said like, “How many routers do you have right now?” The process that they would use to answer that is not going into a system or logging in, it’s actually starting an email chain. That’s actually the one of the main problems that attack surface management attempts to solve, is, How do you have an accurate and up-to-date inventory of everything so that you can then build a variety of processes on top of that, including security? But if you don’t have an up-to-date inventory or you think you do, but you don’t, then when you start to pull on that thread, a lot of business processes, a lot of IT processes, a lot of security processes that you want to have apply across your entire enterprise, all of a sudden you’re realizing, “Wait, this actually is only being partially implemented because if I don’t have a full inventory, how do I actually know what’s going over all of my assets as opposed to just the assets I know about?” And that’s what we talk about when we say “unknown unknowns.” As you mentioned at the top, it’s, “I know some degree of my systems, but do I know all of them?” That delta can be everything for organizations because most of their risk is in the parts of their network they did not even know to investigate.\nLaurel: What other data-driven decisions can be made from this sort of focus on actually knowing where all your assets are. How else can this help the business?\nMatt: Two areas that this really helps organizations with is actually cloud governance and M&A. Particularly, these are very sprawling enterprises. So for a lot of our customers, they might actually have hundreds of different cloud accounts in the public cloud providers, so AWS, Azure, Oracle, Google, Alibaba in a lot of cases, and they had no way to actually rationalize this because they would have a whole bunch of different development teams and they couldn’t get something. And so, when they say that they are moving to the cloud, a typical refrain from our customers will be like, “Yes, we are. We have deals with Amazon and we’re hedging our bets a little bit. We’re also exploring Azure so we’re not solely locked into one cloud.” What we find is that the average customer for Expanse is in 11 different infrastructure providers.\nI’m not talking SaaS, I’m talking in places that you actually get like renting a server, putting data on yourself. It’s amazing and astronomical and we could say, “Well, yeah, you are on Azure. You’re also on AWS. Did you know that you’re also in DigitalOcean? You’re also in Linode. Your general manager in Europe probably put you in OVH or Orange hosting. You have something else in the Malaysian data center. I’m not exactly sure what that is.” And that’s typical. One customer for us was actually in over a hundred different providers because they’re a very large multinational. I think that’s when we see that people’s cloud governance plans versus cloud reality are dramatically different. And helping them with that will enable them to move both securely and quickly to the cloud.\nSecond one is mergers and acquisitions. I think this is something that is increasingly happening. As a lot of industries are consolidating, there’s a lot of M&A activity more recently. But when you think about it, an M&A is one of the largest IT change events an organization can have, especially if it’s a large acquisition. So I know a little bit about this, having recently gone through this process with Palo Alto Networks on ourselves on the other side of the table, but the number of things you have to integrate is quite large. And in the case of Expanse, we’re integrated with a top security company in the world and also we are relatively small. So the integration headaches have been almost nonexistent, and it’s been a really great process.\nBut for larger organizations where you might, an organization with 50,000 people is acquiring an organization with 10,000 people, the number of different steps you have to go through, the amount of IT that you have to transfer, the amount of legacy that you have to understand is gigantic. And in a lot of ways, these are in many cases only partially implemented because as an acquirer, you might not even know where all the assets you’re acquiring are. As an example, for an airline, there was a series of mergers and we’re actually able to find assets of the merged airline that no longer exists, but were still on the internet more than a decade after the merger.\nWhich gives you an idea of just how long some of these things take. That’s the other side of, how we really help with our customers, is actually understanding, “When you actually acquire an asset, how do you actually complete that process? How do you measure it? How do you monitor it and how do you do that at the scale of the internet rather than with a lot of consultants, Excel spreadsheets, pieces of paper and emails?”\nLaurel: So from our conversation today, I feel like this is the, “If you don’t know what you don’t know, you should really figure it out” warning, if you haven’t heard it before. But there are glimmers of hope in this, right? Because if the asset exists, you can at least find it, track it and assess what you’re going to do with it, mediate any changes you need to make or assess it to bring it back to full cybersecurity compliance. What gives you hope about what’s possible after seeing the first three months of this year and what’s happened with attacks, the ongoing issues that we’re going to have? But there is opportunity there, right? There is hope. What are you seeing that makes you optimistic about cybersecurity and what we’re looking forward to in the next five years?\nMatt: Yeah, I’m actually quite optimistic in not even the long-term but even in the medium term I think, even three, four years out. Near-term, definitely there’s going to be some rough seas ahead, but here’s what makes me most optimistic. One, I think that this is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that’s being developed. And by that, it is clear that once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward. There’s a lot of mechanistic steps to get better at that. There’s a lot of automations that can be put on that. And there’s a lot of things coming to bear. But in many cases, the actual hard part is seeing what you actually need to fix and knowing all of the set of problems and then being able to prioritize them effectively and then start working on them.\nAnd I think in particular, the things that I’ve seen are within the industry, I think there are a lot of technologies in the few years that are going to meet the marketing hype that has been around for years. I talk a lot with industry partners. We use substantial amounts of data. With my background where I have a PhD from Stanford in operations research and machine learning, we actually do use some real actual machine learning in our products. We also use a lot of heuristics as well. I joke that we sometimes have machine learning classifiers to solve a problem. Other times we have SQL queries that solve the problem.\nWe have some really well-written SQL queries. I’m very proud of those. But I think that the industry itself, especially in marketing material, you would think that everything in cybersecurity is this automated AI, ML-enabled everything. In most cases, but not all, but in a lot across the industry, and this is especially true in startups, it’s just a line to pitch. And what companies really call AI are just standard software rules and there’s really nothing special going on.\nOr there’s an old joke that, “Oh, I have this great AI thing. What is it? Well, we have a bunch of analysts that are former intelligence officers, usually in Maryland or outside of Tel Aviv and they’re the ones doing everything. But we have a system that efficiently routes work to them and that’s our AI.” And they’re like, “Wait, that’s people.” I think what I’ve seen is that one, automation broadly defined is a real thing. But automation actually means on the ground, is you take something that previously took hours and days and 10 people. And then with software right now, it’s more so how do you take that down to 15 minutes and two or three people?\nI think that we’re going to see even larger gains or even start to take humans out of the loop entirely in certain business processes. And I think what we’re seeing and this is a lot of what we’re working on and I’m working on now is that over the next months and years, actual large-scale machine learning capability is actually being deployed in production. I think there are some that are out there in piecemeal. There’s a lot more rules than anyone wants to talk about, but we are now seeing there’s enough assemblage of data, there’s enough normalization of data in that, especially at the larger companies, and that enterprises are more willing to share information with vendors if it demonstrably improves the security service that they are getting, that we are actually going to be able to deploy increasingly sophisticated capabilities along those lines and have the product/reality match. I think that’s what at least the broader industry marketing zeitgeist had been.\nI’ve seen a lot of them, they are very, very real and they’re very much coming. And they’re coming at an industrial scale for defenders. And I think that’s what I’m most excited about because despite the fact that there’s the old adage of, attackers need to be right once, defenders need to be right all the time, increasingly, it is now more scalable for defenders to be right much of the time and to actually set up very vast monitoring networks so that if the attackers slip up once, the defenders can completely wipe them out in that attack. And that both asymmetrically affects cost and also I think will help tilt the field back to defense.\nMatt: I think when you had partial AI solutions and ML solutions and partial automation, it helped attackers much more because they could duct-tape together a few different parts, scale up certain things very highly and then just see what came back to them in a great way. I think defenders are going to be able to have similar capabilities that are effective because they actually cover everything going on in an enterprise. And that’s going to allow us to turn the tide.\nLaurel:Matt, thank you so much for joining us today in what has been a fantastic conversation on the Business Lab.\nThat was Matt Kraning, the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, who I spoke with from Cambridge, Massachusetts, the home of MIT and MIT Technology Review, overlooking the Charles River.\nThat’s it for this episode of Business Lab.

Its goal is to remove 1 billion tons of the main greenhouse gas fueling climate change by 2035.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The San Francisco–based company will announce on May 26 that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from major investors&nbsp;including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prelude Ventures. (Industry sources say it’s in the millions.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the payment processing company Stripe, which has been funding demonstration projects in this space, will announce that it plans to purchase nearly 250 tons of carbon removal from the company at $2,054 per ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noah Deich, president of Carbon180, a research firm that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon, says the company could help address a core challenge in carbon removal: technical approaches like those offered by direct-air-capture companies such as Climeworks and Carbon Engineering promise permanent results but cost a lot, while natural solutions like soil and forest offsets are cheap but often <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/29/1017811/california-climate-policy-carbon-credits-cause-co2-pollution/\">raise concerns</a> about how reliable and durable the carbon removal is.

(Heirloom’s CEO, Shashank Samala, took part in Carbon180’s entrepreneur-in-residence fellowship program.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the technology is at an early stage and the company will face numerous technical and market challenges along the way, including finding more buyers—like Stripe—willing to pay high prices for carbon removal for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A novel approach to carbon removal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The venture is earning attention in part because the process, described in a paper published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16510-3\">Nature Communications</a> last year, was developed by prominent researchers exploring the use of minerals to capture and store carbon. Those include: Peter Kelemen of Columbia University, Greg Dipple at the University of British Columbia, Phil Renforth of Heriot-Watt University and Jennifer Wilcox, who is now principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy in the Biden administration. The lead author of the paper was Noah McQueen, a graduate student of Wilcox’s and now head of research at Heirloom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preventing the planet from warming by 2 ˚C could require pulling 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050 and 20 billion annually by 2100, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/resource/25259/Negative%20Emissions%20Technologies.pdf\">2018 study</a>. But only a handful of mostly early-stage startups are actively working on this today, exploring a variety of means like <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/02/27/136958/one-mans-two-decade-quest-to-suck-greenhouse-gas-out-of-the-sky/\">creating machines</a> that directly grab carbon dioxide molecules out of the air, <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/lucky-charm/\">converting biowaste into oil</a> that is injected underground, or developing systems to incentivize or validate natural approaches like reforestation or agricultural practices that may take up more carbon in soils.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of scientists and nonprofits have also researched the possibility of accelerating the processes by which various minerals—particularly those rich in silicate, calcium, and magnesium—pull carbon dioxide out of air or rainwater. Some are grinding up and spreading out materials <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/22/1004218/how-green-sand-could-capture-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-dioxide/\">like olivine</a>, while others are putting to use the already pulverized by-products of mining operations, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/06/1009374/asbestos-could-be-a-powerful-weapon-against-climate-change-you-read-that-right/\">even including asbestos</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom is taking a very different route, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The company will cook materials such as ground limestone, which is mostly calcium tied up with carbon dioxide, at temperatures of 400 to 900 ˚C—high enough for it to break down and release the greenhouse gas.

Its goal is to remove 1 billion tons of the main greenhouse gas fueling climate change by 2035.\nThe San Francisco–based company will announce on May 26 that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from major investors including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prelude Ventures. (Industry sources say it’s in the millions.)\nIn addition, the payment processing company Stripe, which has been funding demonstration projects in this space, will announce that it plans to purchase nearly 250 tons of carbon removal from the company at $2,054 per ton.\nNoah Deich, president of Carbon180, a research firm that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon, says the company could help address a core challenge in carbon removal: technical approaches like those offered by direct-air-capture companies such as Climeworks and Carbon Engineering promise permanent results but cost a lot, while natural solutions like soil and forest offsets are cheap but often raise concerns about how reliable and durable the carbon removal is. If Heirloom hits its cost targets, it could offer permanent removal at relatively affordable prices, Deich says. (Heirloom’s CEO, Shashank Samala, took part in Carbon180’s entrepreneur-in-residence fellowship program.)\nBut the technology is at an early stage and the company will face numerous technical and market challenges along the way, including finding more buyers—like Stripe—willing to pay high prices for carbon removal for years to come.\nA novel approach to carbon removal\nThe venture is earning attention in part because the process, described in a paper published in Nature Communications last year, was developed by prominent researchers exploring the use of minerals to capture and store carbon. Those include: Peter Kelemen of Columbia University, Greg Dipple at the University of British Columbia, Phil Renforth of Heriot-Watt University and Jennifer Wilcox, who is now principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy in the Biden administration. The lead author of the paper was Noah McQueen, a graduate student of Wilcox’s and now head of research at Heirloom.\nPreventing the planet from warming by 2 ˚C could require pulling 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050 and 20 billion annually by 2100, according to a 2018 study. But only a handful of mostly early-stage startups are actively working on this today, exploring a variety of means like creating machines that directly grab carbon dioxide molecules out of the air, converting biowaste into oil that is injected underground, or developing systems to incentivize or validate natural approaches like reforestation or agricultural practices that may take up more carbon in soils.\nA number of scientists and nonprofits have also researched the possibility of accelerating the processes by which various minerals—particularly those rich in silicate, calcium, and magnesium—pull carbon dioxide out of air or rainwater. Some are grinding up and spreading out materials like olivine, while others are putting to use the already pulverized by-products of mining operations, even including asbestos.\nHeirloom is taking a very different route, however.\nHow it works\nThe company will cook materials such as ground limestone, which is mostly calcium tied up with carbon dioxide, at temperatures of 400 to 900 ˚C—high enough for it to break down and release the greenhouse gas. This is similar to the first step in producing cement. (It could use other feedstocks as well, such as magnesite, which was the focus of the Nature Communications paper.)\nHeirloom eventually intends to rely on electricity-driven kilns. That means the process can run on clean renewable energy sources and would produce a stream of carbon dioxide free from fossil-fuel impurities. That carbon dioxide can then be relatively easily captured, compressed, and injected underground, storing it away basically forever.\nThe leftover oxide minerals, which would be calcium oxide if the process starts with limestone, can be spread out in thin layers across sheets, stacked vertically, and exposed to the open air. Think lunch trays on cafeteria racks.\nThe minerals are highly reactive, eager to bond with carbon dioxide in the air.

The challenge for data rights advocates, economists, and governments is in developing ways of democratizing the data economy so that societies as a whole can leverage more benefit from the data revolution.\nData is a novel resource requiring new tools to calculate its value and identify its participants.\nThe power of data is relational and cumulative, it is the product of many participants and users who are often unwitting in their contribution to “data labor,” and are often not compensated fairly for it.  We need more sophisticated tools for understanding the unique properties and dynamics of data.\nRedressing the balance of the data economy is a mammoth task that falls to society as a whole.\nInnovations to redress the imbalance of the data economy range from top-down government interventions, such as targeted regulatory reforms, to bottom-up civil society-led actions, where “data stewardship” can be fostered through institutions like trusts, cooperatives, and unions, which give people more control. Overall, a broad community of perspectives should be included in any efforts to rebalance the digital economy.\nDownload the full report.\nThis content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday, May 21, with the intention of staying just a few days—more than enough time, he hoped, to get a dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex had been thinking about how to get vaccinated for weeks. Kenya has <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/kenya/\">received only enough donated doses to vaccinate roughly 1% of its population, and while he would be eligible in the United Kingdom, getting shots there would be</a> very complicated: a 14-day quarantine in a designated hotel upon arrival, registration with a local doctor, another 14-day quarantine upon his return to Kenya, and then likely a repeat of the whole process three or four months later for a second shot, since the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine has not yet been approved in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US, on the other hand, has no quarantine requirements and its <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/22/1021079/united-states-covid19-vaccine-surplus-not-enough-people/\">vaccine supply has outstripped demand since April</a>. After hearing first that a British couple he was friends with had successfully gotten their shot in Colorado, and then that New York City had plans to vaccinate travelers at popular tourist sites, Alex applied for his visa and booked his flight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He doesn’t feel great about it, though. The past few years of US politics have left the country low on his list of places to visit, and it doesn’t make sense to him that he has to travel for a vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a bit of a joke, really,” he told me before his trip. “Is it really better to fly loads of people to New York to do this than to just fly some vaccines from New York to places where vaccines are needed?”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Opportunity for some</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost as soon as the world’s first covid-19 vaccine became available, there were reports of people working the system to get the shot ahead of their turn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, some paid upwards of £40,000 ($56,000) to fly to the United Arab Emirates on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/03/chinas-sinopharm-vaccine-offered-to-elite-few-in-uae-tourist-deal\">luxury vaccine vacations</a>. In the US, some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/us/covid-vaccines-crossing-states.html\">traveled across state lines</a> to take advantage of more permissive eligibility criteria in neighboring states. Others just drove from wealthier neighborhoods to poorer ones, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-22/vaccine-access-codes-for-hard-hit-communities-of-color-circulate-widely-in-affluent-l-a\">armed with access codes</a> meant to help immunize more people from marginalized communities heavily affected by the disease. This wasn’t always called vaccine tourism, but it drew outrage, and no small amount of envy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the vaccines have become more widely available in wealthy nations, the profile of vaccine tourists has also begun to shift—and so have government responses. A small but increasing number of places even see this travel as a way to help restart local economies stalled by the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case with New York City.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early-May, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a proposal to <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-should-offer-covid-shots-tourists-popular-sites-de-blasio-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">offer visitors the J&amp;J vaccine at popular tourist sites </a>such as Central Park and Times Square. “Come here; it’s safe,” he said in a press conference. New York is “a great place to be,” he added, “and we’re going to take care of you. We’re going to make sure you get vaccinated while you’re here with us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That plan is currently pending approval from the state health department, but if Alex is any indication, de Blasio’s message to tourists is already working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just New York. Twenty-four states currently <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/populations-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">do not require residency for vaccines</a>; 25 more offer the shot to both residents and nonresident workers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have become destinations for foreign vaccine tourists. There are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-tv-host-juan-jose-origel-got-coronavirus-vaccine-miami-2021-1\">reports of Mexican celebrities flying into Miami</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/04/21/wealthy-latin-americans-flock-to-us-in-search-of-vaccines/\">Peruvian presidential candidate</a> getting vaccinated in Texas, and <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/7822715/covid-canadians-vaccinated-us/\">Canadians seeking vaccines in American pharmacies</a> just south of the border. At one point, the state of Florida became so concerned about foreign visitors taking advantage of its vaccine availability that it began requiring <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article248671090.html\">proof of residency</a> at vaccination sites. (Florida <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/04/30/florida-eases-vaccine-residency-requirement-paving-way-for-migrants/\">ended the residency requirement  in late April</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other states and territories have been more direct in tying vaccine tourism to their own economic recovery efforts. Alaska will begin offering the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to visitors upon arrival at four airports on June 1, and the US Virgin Islands, while not explicitly marketing themselves as a vaccine tourism destination, have seen the benefits nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This checks a lot of boxes for us,” tourism commissioner Joseph Boschulte told <a href=\"https://www.travelweekly.com/Caribbean-Travel/Insights/USVI-rolls-out-the-welcome-mat-for-vaccine-tourism\">Travel Weekly</a> in April. “Our economy benefits from those who stay several weeks, eat in our restaurants, stay at hotels, charter boats for day trips, and shop while waiting for the second shot. The airlines get the passengers who return a second time, and our visitor numbers increase. Our airlift right now is ahead of both the pre-pandemic lift and the pre-2017 hurricane flight operations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>“A huge disconnect”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the positive vaccine outlook in the United States, global vaccine distribution remains highly inequitable. According to one estimate by the Economist Intelligence Unit, <a href=\"https://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/\">85 low-income countries will not have enough access to vaccines to cover 60% to 70% of the population until 2023</a>. In the US, meanwhile, the Biden administration has set the arbitrary but symbolic deadline of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-government-and-politics-d6ee06383f123a4ef0941847200757df\">reaching 70% of the population with at least one shot </a>by July 4.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s a huge disconnect growing where in some countries with the highest vaccination rates, there appears to be a mindset that the pandemic is over, while others are experiencing huge waves of infection,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a mid-May briefing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that vaccine gap is growing. COVAX, an international initiative to distribute covid-19 vaccines equitably, had<a href=\"https://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/\"> secured commitments from manufacturers and wealthier donor nations for 2 billion doses to deliver to low-income countries by 2021</a>. But the situation on the ground lags far behind those commitments: by the end of May, COVAX will have <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covax-facility-will-deliver-its-65-millionth-vaccine-dose-week-it-shouldve-been\">distributed only 65 million doses</a>, far fewer even than its intended May goal of 170 million, and Unicef predicts that the initiative will have a shortfall of 190 million doses by the end of June. This is due primarily to production and distribution delays in India, a global vaccine production hub in the midst of a devastating second covid wave that has left at least 23 million infected and 250,000 dead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A few days after Tedros’s press conference, in response to mounting international pressure, the Biden administration pledged 20 million doses from its stash of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines to COVAX. This represented a significant shift in policy: it was the first time the US was donating doses that could have been used domestically. (The administration has also committed to donate 60 million doses of AstraZeneca to COVAX but has yet to do so.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glenn Cohen, a law professor who directs Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, says that the pledge of 20 million doses is “a good first step” for a country that cannot get enough of its own people to use up its vaccine supply quickly enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, he adds, it does not negate the ethical murkiness<em> </em>of having American cities and states offer, or consider offering, vaccines to visitors as official policy. Cohen, who has written a book on medical tourism, says vaccines were meant to go first to “those who are most in need” and not to “people who are able to travel, who have visas, who are able-bodied.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it another way, he says: it’s as if “someone loans you their car to take your mother to the hospital, and then you decide to take that car and instead of giving it back to the person—or taking other people to the hospital—you run it as an Uber.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Outsourcing ethical quandaries&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Amler, the dean of New York Medical College’s school of health science and practice, says that encouraging travelers to fly to the United States from places with low vaccination rates—and potentially higher levels of infection—may itself be bad for public health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any risk of ‘importing’ covid infections will depend on the volume of incoming travelers and the percent of travelers arriving who already have covid infection,” says Amler, a former chief medical officer at the CDC. “We also can’t predict with certitude the city’s ability to manage their numbers if they become excessive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To combat this danger, some people who are traveling to get vaccinated are taking their own precautions to avoid becoming unwitting vectors for the virus—or causing other kinds of harm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Michael” (also a pseudonym) and his wife flew from Quito, Ecuador, to New Orleans for a five-day trip in mid-May, during which he received the J&amp;J shot and she got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael’s family in Canada have yet to meet the couple’s twin boys, who were born in January 2020. By going to Louisiana for their shots, he estimates that they’ve sped up their vaccination status—and therefore their family reunion—by six to nine months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the couple wanted to make sure they were not taking vaccines that could have gone to someone else. “Our first thought was to go to a red state, because we knew supply outstripped demand,” he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They took extra precautions before and during their trip, too. Having both contracted covid much earlier in the pandemic, they got antibody tests before flying. Then they kept to themselves to limit their exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;The question is really about what states are doing with their resources and which countries are continuing to use them [vaccines] for their own advantage. Globally, that’s really wrong.&#8221;</p><cite>Nicole Hassoun, Binghamton University</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking the initiative, they may have dampened the potential negative impact from their trip, but this highlights another problem of vaccine tourism as policy—and of much of the world’s covid-19 response in general. Difficult ethical decisions that could have—or, some argue, should have—been matters of policy are instead being pushed onto individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The city is the one who sets the queue,” says Pamela Hieronymi, a philosopher at the University of California, Los Angeles. So if you have an issue with vaccine tourists in, say, New York, “it seems your complaint should be made to the city, not to the person using the line offered to them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicole Hassoun, a philosophy professor at Binghamton University and the head of its Global Health Impact Project, also argues that while vaccine tourists may grapple with their choice, the real ethical issue is not at the individual level. “I think the question is really about what states are doing with their resources and which countries are continuing to use them [vaccines] for their own advantage,” she says. “Globally, that’s really wrong.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may also be second-order effects like exacerbating local inequality, says Yadurshini Raveendran, a graduate of the Duke Global Health Institute, who points out that richer individuals in low-income countries—those who travel internationally and are thus more likely to take advantage of vaccine tourism—already have better access to health care than poorer people in those countries. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/22/1016471/israel-covid-vaccine-rollout-hadas-ziv/\">Israel has the highest vaccination rates in the world</a>, she notes, but Palestine has administered one dose to just 5% of the population.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Michael, who runs a marketing business in Quito, wants his employees to have the same options he did. “I’ve been thinking about giving my employees a mid-year bonus to fly to the States to get vaccinated if they want,” he says. For those who do not already have US travel documents, however, waiting for a visa appointment may take longer than waiting for a vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really, it should come back to public health, says Amler, of New York Medical College. Traveling for the vaccine “may well be effective for the individuals who get jabbed,” he says. “However, the much more efficient approach is to ship vaccine to other countries, where their people can be vaccinated in greater numbers and without the inconvenience, expense, and inequitable impact of personal international travel.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>“Vaccine buffet”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, Alex made his way to the Javits Center, the gleaming glass conference center on Manhattan’s west side that has been converted first into a covid field hospital and then into a mass vaccination site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, presented with the choice of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer vaccines, he stuck to his plan of the single J&amp;J shot—though he briefly considered whether to supplement either of the shots at Javits with a Pfizer dose later, in the UK. “Vaccine buffet,” he joked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was the most impressive health-care experience I have known,” he told me before catching his flight out. It was efficient—he was vaccinated in less than five minutes—and seemed genuinely committed to serving people equitably.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you see something that fancy&#8230; run extremely well, courteously, not with any of the bleakness or contempt sometimes at play with&#8230; free public services,” he said, it is “amazing to see.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His goal accomplished, Alex spent the rest of his weekend biking around the city and enjoying its famous cuisine, eating outdoors. He avoided bars and clubs, “despite how much fun it looked,” he said. “Maybe if I come back once the vaccine has activated.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite his expressed dislike of the United States before his vaccine vacation, he’s now thinking about coming back. “This vaccine thing has shown me that America does have a side to it that cares about basic public health,” he said. “More than that, once it mobilizes its resources, what it can actually achieve is astounding.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/covid-pandemic-tech\">Pandemic Technology Project</a>, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.</em></p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Like many vaccine tourists, “Alex” doesn’t want you to know his real name. \nThe British expat arrived on a red-eye flight from his home in Nairobi, Kenya, at New York’s John F.

So if you have an issue with vaccine tourists in, say, New York, “it seems your complaint should be made to the city, not to the person using the line offered to them.”\nNicole Hassoun, a philosophy professor at Binghamton University and the head of its Global Health Impact Project, also argues that while vaccine tourists may grapple with their choice, the real ethical issue is not at the individual level. “I think the question is really about what states are doing with their resources and which countries are continuing to use them [vaccines] for their own advantage,” she says. “Globally, that’s really wrong.”\nThere may also be second-order effects like exacerbating local inequality, says Yadurshini Raveendran, a graduate of the Duke Global Health Institute, who points out that richer individuals in low-income countries—those who travel internationally and are thus more likely to take advantage of vaccine tourism—already have better access to health care than poorer people in those countries. Israel has the highest vaccination rates in the world, she notes, but Palestine has administered one dose to just 5% of the population. \nMichael, who runs a marketing business in Quito, wants his employees to have the same options he did. “I’ve been thinking about giving my employees a mid-year bonus to fly to the States to get vaccinated if they want,” he says. For those who do not already have US travel documents, however, waiting for a visa appointment may take longer than waiting for a vaccine.\nReally, it should come back to public health, says Amler, of New York Medical College. Traveling for the vaccine “may well be effective for the individuals who get jabbed,” he says. “However, the much more efficient approach is to ship vaccine to other countries, where their people can be vaccinated in greater numbers and without the inconvenience, expense, and inequitable impact of personal international travel.”\n“Vaccine buffet”\nOn Saturday, Alex made his way to the Javits Center, the gleaming glass conference center on Manhattan’s west side that has been converted first into a covid field hospital and then into a mass vaccination site. \nThere, presented with the choice of Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines, he stuck to his plan of the single J&J shot—though he briefly considered whether to supplement either of the shots at Javits with a Pfizer dose later, in the UK. “Vaccine buffet,” he joked. \n“It was the most impressive health-care experience I have known,” he told me before catching his flight out. It was efficient—he was vaccinated in less than five minutes—and seemed genuinely committed to serving people equitably. \n“When you see something that fancy… run extremely well, courteously, not with any of the bleakness or contempt sometimes at play with… free public services,” he said, it is “amazing to see.”\nHis goal accomplished, Alex spent the rest of his weekend biking around the city and enjoying its famous cuisine, eating outdoors. He avoided bars and clubs, “despite how much fun it looked,” he said. “Maybe if I come back once the vaccine has activated.” \nAnd despite his expressed dislike of the United States before his vaccine vacation, he’s now thinking about coming back. “This vaccine thing has shown me that America does have a side to it that cares about basic public health,” he said. “More than that, once it mobilizes its resources, what it can actually achieve is astounding.”\nThis story is part of the Pandemic Technology Project, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.","dc:creator":"Eileen Guo","content":"Like many vaccine tourists, “Alex” doesn’t want you to know his real name.&#160; The British expat arrived on a red-eye flight from his home in Nairobi, Kenya, at New York’s John F.

Are we just as frequently stopping to celebrate things that are going well? We all love receiving gratitude, why aren’t we expressing it often enough?</p><p>The recognition culture is precisely about avoiding the pitfall of:</p><blockquote>“No matter how hard you work you never hear a good word from anybody. But make one mistake and there’s always somebody jumping all over you!”</blockquote><p>I first learned about Kudos in Jurgen Appelo’s book on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=asc_df_0321712471/?tag=googshopes-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=54563705115&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9690774498925737917&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1005424&amp;hvtargid=pla-79018669046&amp;psc=1\">Management 3.0</a>. I have the version with pictures called “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/-/pt/dp/1119268680/ref=pd_sbs_1/258-8280429-5165733?pd_rd_w=Q3kSE&amp;pf_rd_p=c289ec33-e7ac-4087-b63e-bf352f1cf145&amp;pf_rd_r=2AB3B9BDHT74BAMWMVW3&amp;pd_rd_r=0ac6a8ea-0630-47e1-b23e-d532b2b7a8ce&amp;pd_rd_wg=vglyT&amp;pd_rd_i=1119268680&amp;psc=1\">Managing for Happiness</a>”. If you haven’t heard about it, I highly recommend getting yourself a copy. If you ever thought about becoming a manager, it is a must-read. It gamifies the experience and is fun to read and practice. I explain more about Management 3.0 and leadership best practices in my article “<a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum/leadership-is-not-a-role-it-is-a-relationship-4d581b07dc68\">Leadership Is Not A Role, It Is A Relationship</a>”.</p><h3><strong>Extrinsic and Intrinsic motivation</strong></h3><p>Kudos are described in the first chapter of the book. The subtitle goes “Motivate people with better rewards”. First, let’s explain the two different kinds of motivation to understand why it is important.</p><p><strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong> is fuelled by external rewards like money, grades, or praise, e.g. the employee of the month. The common pitfall here is that the incentives make people stop doing their tasks just for the joy of well-done work and start looking for rewards. And rewards based on outcomes increase the risk of cheating. People will find any shortcut to get the bonus and in the process, they may lose the enjoyment of work.</p><p>Just think about all those bankers in the US in 2008 who gave out mortgages to their customers like candies just to get their cut. Here’s how a badly thought bonus scheme can drown not only a company but whole countries! <br>Of course, we are talking about knowledge work, in environments based on highly repetitive work, the rewards help keep you going. However, they need to be adjusted from time to time because after some time they may stop working.</p><p><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> is different, here the behavior is triggered from within a person according to their values and judgments. It is where longevity and true engagement will come from.</p><h3><strong>What are Kudos and what do they have to do with intrinsic motivation?</strong></h3><p>Kudo cards are small tokens employees give each other when they want to express gratitude. I am used to using the template Jurgen Appelo has on his <a href=\"https://management30.com/practice/kudo-cards/\">management 3.0 website</a> but you can use anything, even send a short message on Slack.</p><figure><img alt=\"Kudos cards template\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m7zVHjjoAJBEqpWQXgzz1A.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Kudos template as per Management 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>In the old-normality, we would install a Kudo box in the cafeteria of our office. We would ask the employees to recognize each other’s behavior by leaving Kudos Cards in the box. Then on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, during informal company gatherings like breakfasts, we would read the cards aloud. After each readout, the person who received a Kudo would come and pick up their card. As per public recognition, remember? This way we were able to create our Kudos collections on our desk.</p><p>In the remote reality, where many of us will stay for a little longer or forever, you can create a Kudos channel on Slack or Teams. And you can use the online tool I like to use <a href=\"https://kudobox.co/\">kudobox.co</a> to write digital kudos. Once the card is written you can download it or take a screenshot and post it on the channel tagging the person you wish to express gratitude to. In my company the Kudos come on a daily basis.</p><p>When we receive thanks from another colleague in the form of Kudos it usually is unexpected and a sincere way to give thanks. Recognition and public praise elevate our social status. And this stimulates serotonin in the brain. That’s why we feel so good when we are praised. Giving Kudos is a way of recognizing each other. Not just top to bottom but between peers. It is harder to cheat the system when rewards are not scheduled, anticipated, or promised in advance. Plus, having a community that enjoys their interactions helps to keep their engagement and loyalty.</p><p>Elevating social status may seem like an external motivation and to a certain extent, it is. However, status can be a very personal treat. Feeling that others value your input, experience, and willingness to help can go hand in hand with our internal values.</p><h3><strong>Six traits for positive rewards</strong></h3><p>Appelo lists six traits of positive rewards, which also explains why giving Kudos is a great way to stimulate intrinsic motivation:</p><ol><li><strong>Don’t promise rewards in advance</strong> — yearly bonus, an employee of the month, those are anticipated rewards, research shows however that when acknowledgment of work comes as a surprise, intrinsic motivation will not be undermined — Kudos are unexpected.</li><li><strong>Keep anticipated rewards small</strong> — there are a lot of stories about Hackathons at work going awry because a big prize was set. When people focus on the reward instead of a great idea to work on, then their creativity can be hindered and instead of being innovative they will focus on “what the CTO will love most”. So keeping anticipated rewards small is a good idea to keep the creativity.</li><li><strong>Reward continuously not once</strong> — celebrate daily wins and key accomplishments, don’t wait for big events. You can give kudos in digital form on a daily basis by creating a Kudos Slack channel.</li><li><strong>Reward publicly, not privately</strong> — as mentioned previously, the key is to recognize in public and make clear what is being rewarded and why. It gives everyone an idea about the desired behavior according to our company culture.</li><li><strong>Reward behavior not outcome</strong> — outcomes can often be achieved through shortcuts and behavior is about hard work and effort.</li><li><strong>Reward peers, not subordinates </strong>— peers may know better than managers which colleague deserves a reward.</li></ol><h3><strong>Define recognition</strong></h3><p>A good practice I noticed in some companies is to tie the company values to recognition. Let’s imagine one of our company values is to be “Collaborative”. Then on a Kudos template, you would have those values instead of a generic “Good job!”. Typically, you’d have a little description of what “collaborative” means for your company. This can serve as a guide for people to look for certain desirable behavior in their colleagues. This way people are much better fitted to address those qualities in other people’s behavior.</p><h3><strong>What do we write?</strong></h3><p>This is the most important part for me. And for this part, I recommend you watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l7TONauJGfc\">Marshall Rosenberg’s training in Nonviolent Communication</a>. He explains like no one else why saying “Great job!” or “You’re brilliant!” really means nothing. What was the behavior we would like to keep and have more of? We need to name it.</p><p>When expressing gratitude we want to let the other person know specifically what they did that made life more wonderful for us. Not just give some vague generality like “Nice work!”</p><p>Marshall’s proposition is to explain how someone’s behavior has helped us or had a positive effect on us, the product, or the company.</p><ol><li><strong>Describe a concrete action</strong> — bring to other people’s attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. Avoid vague generalizations. E.g. “You offered to help me with the presentation.”</li><li><strong>How did it make you feel </strong>— “I felt relieved when you offered to help”; “I felt energized after the warm-up before the training.”</li><li><strong>What need of yours has been met</strong> —” I felt relieved when you offered to help because I felt very lost. I didn’t know how to start this presentation and needed some direction.”</li></ol><h3><strong>Receiving gratitude</strong></h3><p>The truth is we are somewhat uncomfortable with giving and receiving. Marshall Rosenberg says we are used to receiving gratitude in two polar ways. Both coming from egotism:</p><ol><li><strong>Feeling superior</strong> because we<em> deserved</em> this gratitude.</li><li><strong>Shrugging it off</strong> — saying “That’s nothing”; “De nada”; “Nie ma za co” — we have that expression in many languages. Rosenberg calls it “false humility” as it denies the importance of appreciation.</li></ol><p>Why not receive gratitude joyfully? Why not say, “I’m happy to have helped!” or even “Anytime!”. To do that we need to stop fearing getting thanks.</p><p>I really like the following lines from a book by Marianne Williamson:</p><blockquote>“Playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.”</blockquote><blockquote>“When we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.</blockquote><p>A culture of recognition can be trained. And we can do it in our own way, so it best fits us and our company culture, this way it doesn’t feel fake or forced. As Scrum Masters, it is part of our role to foster a feedback culture, where inspection and adaptation don’t just happen on a special occasion but become a part of our everyday work.

Choose Scrum for the Right Purpose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Strive for High Product Quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/technical-debt-scrum/\" title=\"Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible? Age-of-Product.com \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Garbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/28-product-backlog-anti-patterns/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns - Age-of-Product.com\" target=\"_blank\">28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns</a>.) </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Embrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Restrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In none of these four areas, a Scrum Master can advance the cause without the deliberate and voluntary support of other people. This is a great challenge many successful Scrum Masters love to address. Unfortunately, however, not all of us are so fortunate to work under these conditions. The frustrated Scrum Master symptom is real; not every Scrum Master who performs below expectations does so because of a lack of competence. Sometimes, former missionaries turn into mercenaries when they see no use to continue fighting inertia, politics, or conflicting agendas. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Possible Reasons Why Missionaries Become a Frustrated Scrum Master</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reasons why able and willing Scrum Masters abandon the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. Probably, the Scrum Master has been working his or her butt off for months, but neither the Scrum Team nor the organization is responding to the effort. There are many potential reasons for a failure at this level, to name a few:</p> \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The lack of sponsoring from the C-level of the organization</li> \r\n\t<li>A widespread belief that &#8216;Agile&#8217; is just the latest management fad, and thus ignorable </li>\r\n\t<li>The company culture values neither transparency nor radical candor</li>\r\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-failure-culture-making-your-scrum-work-10\" title=\"Why Scrum Requires a Failure Culture — Making Your Scrum Work #10\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">company has no failure culture</a>; consequently, everyone plays safe, resulting in short-term orientation as not-failing is more important than innovation </li>\r\n\t<li>The Scrum Team composition is wrong</li>\r\n\t<li>Members of the Scrum Team object self-management</li>\r\n\t<li>There is no psychological safety to address the Scrum Team&#8217;s problems </li>\r\n\t<li>Individual team members harbor personal agendas unaligned with the team&#8217;s objective. </li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These examples can lead an able and willing Scrum Master off the path, resulting in a frustrated Scrum Master either considering leaving for a more supportive environment or turning into a mercenary, trading time for a paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/frustrated-scrum-master/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnwKgNCs7G9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Frustrated Scrum Master — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous reasons why a Scrum Master may leave the path and become a frustrated Scrum Master or even a mercenary. However, before you jump to conclusions, try and understand the context of the development. Probably, it does not have anything to do with competence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is your organization failing to support its Scrum Masters, thus advancing the problem of the frustrated Scrum Master?

Choose Scrum for the Right Purpose\n\r\n\r\nChoosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n2. Strive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n3. Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n4. Embrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\nIn none of these four areas, a Scrum Master can advance the cause without the deliberate and voluntary support of other people. This is a great challenge many successful Scrum Masters love to address. Unfortunately, however, not all of us are so fortunate to work under these conditions. The frustrated Scrum Master symptom is real; not every Scrum Master who performs below expectations does so because of a lack of competence. Sometimes, former missionaries turn into mercenaries when they see no use to continue fighting inertia, politics, or conflicting agendas. \n\r\n\r\nPossible Reasons Why Missionaries Become a Frustrated Scrum Master\n\r\n\r\nThe reasons why able and willing Scrum Masters abandon the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. Probably, the Scrum Master has been working his or her butt off for months, but neither the Scrum Team nor the organization is responding to the effort. There are many potential reasons for a failure at this level, to name a few:\n \r\n\r\n\t\nThe lack of sponsoring from the C-level of the organization\n \r\n\t\nA widespread belief that ‘Agile’ is just the latest management fad, and thus ignorable \n\r\n\t\nThe company culture values neither transparency nor radical candor\n\r\n\t\nThe company has no failure culture; consequently, everyone plays safe, resulting in short-term orientation as not-failing is more important than innovation \n\r\n\t\nThe Scrum Team composition is wrong\n\r\n\t\nMembers of the Scrum Team object self-management\n\r\n\t\nThere is no psychological safety to address the Scrum Team’s problems \n\r\n\t\nIndividual team members harbor personal agendas unaligned with the team’s objective. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese examples can lead an able and willing Scrum Master off the path, resulting in a frustrated Scrum Master either considering leaving for a more supportive environment or turning into a mercenary, trading time for a paycheck.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Frustrated Scrum Master — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons why a Scrum Master may leave the path and become a frustrated Scrum Master or even a mercenary. However, before you jump to conclusions, try and understand the context of the development. Probably, it does not have anything to do with competence.\n\r\n\r\nHow is your organization failing to support its Scrum Masters, thus advancing the problem of the frustrated Scrum Master?

But as is par for the course with Cantrell, Phantom is trying to find success by swimming against the current.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the hottest trends in rockets right now is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/09/65208/rocket-ride-shares-could-make-going-to-space-like-catching-a-bus/\">ride-share launches</a>, where customers buy available spots for their payloads on a midsize or large rocket with a specific departure date. This is usually a cheaper way than single launches for customers to get a payload into space—with SpaceX’s ride-share program, it costs $1 million to launch a 200-kilogram payload (its Falcon 9 rocket can take 22,800 kg total into low Earth orbit). The company launched a dedicated ride-share mission on January 21, deploying a record 143 satellites into orbit. It’s following up with a similar mission in June. In a surprising about-face in March, Rocket Lab, which has long resisted the idea of building larger rockets, unveiled the Neutron&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/02/1020212/rocket-lab-could-be-spacexs-biggest-rival-neutron-falcon-9/\">for the precise purpose of doing ride-share launches</a>&nbsp;and competing with the SpaceX Falcon 9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride shares aren’t Phantom’s cup of tea. The company wants to establish its space footprint by mass-manufacturing small rockets and launching a hundred a year. “We want to be the Henry Ford of space,” says Cantrell. “We’re taking a contrarian view of how we develop this.” Just as Henry Ford didn’t reinvent the car but the way it was built, Phantom isn’t out to reinvent rockets—just their production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How so? When SpaceX started, the supply chains for aerospace companies going into orbit were enmeshed in the financial system of the US Defense Department. To stay independent of that system, SpaceX decided to build everything itself, relying on Musk’s fortune and a ton of investment to stay afloat during years of losses. It was a long-term gamble that paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Phantom’s founders decided they didn’t need to follow suit. Even in just the last five years, aerospace supply chains have become more fluid and competitive, which means Phantom can just buy the specific parts it wants rather than build everything from scratch. It buys 3D-printed engines from Ursa Major in Colorado. The design of the flight computer was licensed from NASA, and it uses a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beagleboard.org/black\">BeagleBone Black board</a> that some distributors sell for around $50. Other components, like batteries and telemetry systems, are bought through the missile defense supply chain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Henry Ford analogy isn’t just an aspiration—it’s a model for the company. Cofounder Michael D’Angelo says the car and rocket businesses follow similar growth curves: doubling production leads to certain economies of scale also associated with greater efficiency and fewer production errors. Computers and mobile devices followed a similar path. And he argues that the supply chains nowadays are mature enough to allow for the kind of speedy manufacturing Phantom wants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the company is pursuing two types of rockets. There’s the 18.7-meter-tall Daytona, which should be able to lift about 450 kilograms into space. It’s perhaps on the larger end of what might be termed the small-rocket class, but according to Cantrell, the company’s analysis estimates this to be an optimum size for profitable activity. Then there’s Laguna, a 20.5-meter-tall rocket that can lift payloads of up to 1,200 kg. Phantom is developing a version of Laguna with a reusable first-stage booster, like a SpaceX Falcon 9 (with a similar vertical landing process).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2338\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025355\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg 2338w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=768,591 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=1536,1183 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=2048,1577 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2338px) 100vw, 2338px\" /><figcaption>An artist&#8217;s rendering of the Daytona rocket flying into space.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">PHANTOM SPACE</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Phantom is hoping to fill a gap in the market. While ride shares are cheap, customers have less control over how the mission goes. A ride-share mission, like a train, is on a fixed route. If you want your satellite to go a different orbit or trajectory, you need to install expensive thrusters that can take it there. Otherwise, you have to redesign its function for the new orbit, tolerate a less favorable orbit, or simply buy a ticket for a different mission. And you better hope your satellite can fit snugly with all the other payloads it’s going with—these flights are fully booked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small-rocket launch might cost more, but it gives control back to the customer. If you have a mission with very specific requirements—like replacing a particular satellite in a constellation, launching sensitive equipment, or running an expensive tech demo—you’ll probably want a dedicated flight rather than a ride share. “There’s definitely an interest and demand for these small-rocket launches,” says Ryan Martineau, a space system engineer at the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Utah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cantrell thinks Phantom can meet this demand without blowing its budget. He estimates that the company’s approach can actually offer launches for a third the price of the ride-share model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, though, the company has to actually get to space. The aim is for Daytona to make its first spaceflight in 2023. Classically, says Cantrell, there’s a 50% reliability rate for the first four flights of a new rocket. Phantom’s plans more or less assume that at least one of its first four flights gets to orbit. It recently signed a lease from the Air Force for a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and it is currently looking for permission to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as well—important initial steps if 100 launches a year is truly the goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phantom also wants to build satellites and become something of a one-stop shop for customers. Its acquisition of Cantrell’s StratSpace this week is supposed to be a key part of this side of the business. The company is working on constellation prototypes for customers and is part of a group developing a commercially funded $1.2 billion science mission (specific details won&#8217;t be disclosed for several months). And it has been quietly working on a communications network it calls Phantom Cloud, which is essentially a mesh network other satellites can use to communicate with each other or with systems on the surface. Cantrell calls it “satellite internet for space.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, Phantom doesn’t exactly need to beat SpaceX and the other large rocket makers—it just needs to hold its own. “As the small-launcher market matures, I think you’ll see a wider variety of customers taking advantage of that capability,” says Martineau. “I think it’s unlikely that one will become dominant and edge out the other.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coexistence is fine, says Cantrell: “We recognize that SpaceX has magnificently developed this large reusable space transportation system, but we think that is but one of at least two—maybe more—fundamentally different economic systems in the space transportation ecosystem.” He hopes it’s Phantom that pioneers the other.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Jim Cantrell calls himself “one of the intellectual fathers of the small-launch business.” It’s hard to disagree.

It recently signed a lease from the Air Force for a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and it is currently looking for permission to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as well—important initial steps if 100 launches a year is truly the goal.\nPhantom also wants to build satellites and become something of a one-stop shop for customers. Its acquisition of Cantrell’s StratSpace this week is supposed to be a key part of this side of the business. The company is working on constellation prototypes for customers and is part of a group developing a commercially funded $1.2 billion science mission (specific details won’t be disclosed for several months). And it has been quietly working on a communications network it calls Phantom Cloud, which is essentially a mesh network other satellites can use to communicate with each other or with systems on the surface. Cantrell calls it “satellite internet for space.”\nIn reality, Phantom doesn’t exactly need to beat SpaceX and the other large rocket makers—it just needs to hold its own. “As the small-launcher market matures, I think you’ll see a wider variety of customers taking advantage of that capability,” says Martineau. “I think it’s unlikely that one will become dominant and edge out the other.” \nCoexistence is fine, says Cantrell: “We recognize that SpaceX has magnificently developed this large reusable space transportation system, but we think that is but one of at least two—maybe more—fundamentally different economic systems in the space transportation ecosystem.” He hopes it’s Phantom that pioneers the other.","dc:creator":"Neel V.

Now Let’s install some packages by typing this command npm i discord.js dotenv.\n\nLet’s create a file named .env. This file will contain our Environment variables like TOKEN and PREFIX for our bot.\nLet’s get our token for our discord bot. Go to Discord Developer Portal and Sign up if you haven’t already. Now open Applications tab and Click on New Application. Type a name and press Create.\n\nNow that you have created a application, Set it up by typing name and giving it a Profile Picture.\nClick on the Bot tab, and Copy the Token.\n\nPaste it in your .env file. Your file should look like this\nTOKEN=PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE\nPREFIX=!\nLet’s invite our bot to our server by going to OAuth2 tab and giving it scope of bot and permission of Administrator, Copy the url and paste it in your Browser, Now select your server and Press Continue.\n\nNow we are setup to create our Discord bot.\nLogging in to our bot\nCreate index.js file inside your project and start typing your code.\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config(); // Telling Nodejs, We are using dotenv to get environment variables\nconst discord = require(\"discord.js\"); // Importing discord.js library\nconst client = new discord.Client(); // Creating a client for our bot\nconst fs = require(\"fs\"); // We are gonna need filesystem module for later.\n// Your CODE WILL GO HERE\nclient.login(process.env.TOKEN); // Login into your discord bot you created by this method and passing it the token\nLet’s listen to the ready event (it fires when our bot is ready to use).\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config(); // Telling Nodejs, We are using dotenv to get environment variables\nconst discord = require(\"discord.js\"); // Importing discord.js library\nconst client = new discord.Client(); // Creating a client for our bot\nconst fs = require(\"fs\"); // We are gonna need filesystem module for later.\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n    console.log(\"Hello World!\");\n});\nclient.login(process.env.TOKEN); // Login into your discord bot you created by this method and passing it the token\nNow if you run your bot by typing nodemon index in your powershell. You will see Hello World! logged into your terminal.\n\nCreating commands\nTo create commands, create directory named commands in your project. Let’s create a basic command ping for our bot.

Then that server responds with a resource such as images, videos, or HTML web page, which your browser going to displays for you. So, this is the simplest way to answer that question. However, we all know there are lot more happening on the underline. But in this article, we are going to learn about one of the main components of this process, HTTP protocol.</p><h3>What is HTTP?</h3><p>The HTTP acronym stands for <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong>. HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web (WWW) to exchange information, that found on web pages. When accessing any web page entering “<strong>http://”</strong> in front of the address tells the web browser to communicate over HTTP. For example, the URL for Google is https://www.google.com. But if you notice, today’s browsers no longer require HTTP in front of the URL since it is the default method of communication. However, it is kept in browsers because of the need to separate protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p><blockquote><strong>Other notable protocols are:</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</strong> is a standard protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):</strong> is a standard for email transmission.</blockquote><p>HTTP is defined as a <strong>stateless</strong>, “client-server” protocol or “request-response” protocol. Stateless means that all requests are separate from each other. So, every request from your browser must contain enough information on its own for the server to fulfill the request. That means each request is executed without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it or after it.</p><p>The client-server protocol describes the communication between two computers. The client (browser or another application) requests data and the server provide a response. So, this is how we can go to a website and see information on that website. With HTTP protocol, the client request always happens first and is followed by the server’s response.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tTfea0jC2fDBx4pFPnoo9w.png\" /><figcaption>Image: How HTTP Works (<a href=\"https://whatis.techtarget.com/\">https://whatis.techtarget.com/</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h3><p>The S in HTTPS is stands for “secure.” HTTPS uses <strong>TLS</strong> or <strong>SSL</strong> to encrypt HTTP requests and responses. So basically, the only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. Because of that HTTPS can protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A website that uses HTTP has <strong>“http://”</strong> in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has <strong>“https://”</strong></p><h3>HTTP Requests</h3><p>When you want to access a web site using web browser, you simply type the URL and press the enter. So, this is when a client device (web browser), asks the server for the information needed to load the website. The request provides the server with the desired information it needs to adjust its response to the client device. There are several HTTP request methods known as <strong>Get, Post, Delete, Put, and Head</strong>. However, in this case it used the Get request, because it is how we get the content of that web site.</p><ul><li><strong>GET:</strong> The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.</li><li><strong>HEAD:</strong> Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.</li><li><strong>POST:</strong> A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.</li><li><strong>PUT:</strong> Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.</li><li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.</li><li><strong>CONNECT: </strong>Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.</li><li><strong>OPTIONS:</strong> Describes the communication options for the target resource.</li></ul><h3>HTTP Responses</h3><p>The HTTP response message is the data that sent by the web server to a client device, based on the HTTP request made by the client device. Well, every time there is a request, HTTP will always response it. The information contained in a HTTP response is modified to the context the server received from the request.</p><p>So, whenever server response to HTTP requests, usually it issues <strong>response codes</strong>, indicating the request is being processed, there was an error in the request or that the request is being redirected.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lKywt6QqttdSjsGiflAbmA.png\" /><figcaption>Image: HTTP Status Code (<a href=\"https://softcrony.com/\">https://softcrony.com/</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>OSI Model</h3><p>So, what is this OSI Model or the <strong>Open Systems Interconnection model</strong>. This model is used to describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early days. But the thing is modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler <strong>TCP/IP model</strong>.</p><p>However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, because it’s very useful in various use cases such as, it helps visualize and communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/905/1*YxLHP8BpeiXpuqSrjZnm-w.png\" /><figcaption>Image: 7 layers of OSI Model (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">https://www.cloudflare.com/</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Now I am going to explain each layer of OSI Model from top to bottom.</p><h4>Application Layer</h4><p>This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients depend on the application layer to initiate communications. To make things clear, that client software applications are not part of the application layer. However, the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present information to the user. Application layer protocols include<strong> HTTP, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), </strong>and<strong> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).</strong></p><h4>Presentation Layer</h4><p>This layer is mainly responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer. So, it defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data, so it received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.</p><p>In case if there are devices that communicating over an encrypted connection, presentation layer is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender’s end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver’s end as well. So, it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.</p><h4>Session Layer</h4><p>This layer is responsible for creating communication channels, called sessions, between devices. Also, the Session Layer is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends.</p><p>Additionally, it can set checkpoints during a data transfer, if the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.</p><h4>Transport Layer</h4><p>This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. It takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into <strong>“segments”</strong> on the transmitting end. Transport Layer responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer. The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control as well.</p><h4>Network Layer</h4><p>This layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If there are 2 devices that communicate on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called “<strong>packets</strong>.” So, on the sender’s device, these packets reassembled on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as <strong>routing.</strong></p><h4>Data Link Layer</h4><p>This layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called as “<strong>frames.”</strong> The data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in <strong>intra-network communication</strong>.</p><h4>Physical Layer</h4><p>This layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a <strong>bit stream, </strong>which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.</p><p>So, this is the end of the article and I hope you enjoyed it.

The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.\nIn case if there are devices that communicating over an encrypted connection, presentation layer is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender’s end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver’s end as well. So, it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.\nSession Layer\nThis layer is responsible for creating communication channels, called sessions, between devices. Also, the Session Layer is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends.\nAdditionally, it can set checkpoints during a data transfer, if the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.\nTransport Layer\nThis layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. It takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end. Transport Layer responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer. The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control as well.\nNetwork Layer\nThis layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If there are 2 devices that communicate on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called “packets.” So, on the sender’s device, these packets reassembled on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as routing.\nData Link Layer\nThis layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called as “frames.” The data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication.\nPhysical Layer\nThis layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.\nSo, this is the end of the article and I hope you enjoyed it.

Product Leader</h3><p>This is Part 1 of the “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@James_Wang-Product/becoming-a-product-leader-introduction-3410931eb7ce\">Becoming a Product Leader</a>” series. In this series, I’m tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to become a Product Leader. This article focuses on shifting one’s perspective from a team level Product Manager to an organization wide Product Leader.</p><p>The biggest obstacle I faced when trying to move from Product Manager to Product Leader was my own mindset. I had a number of attitudes and beliefs that were counterproductive and held me back:</p><ul><li>Leadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.</li><li>How am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.</li><li>I can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.</li></ul><p>You may or may not suffer from any of these misconceptions. But I’ve seen other experienced individual contributors making the same mistakes, banging their heads against the ceiling of management and leadership.</p><p>Changing my perspective was difficult and is an ongoing struggle. But pushing myself to a new mindset has made all the difference in my ability to be a leader.</p><blockquote>Leadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OSsjJuFf0YLqAUofDApYZw.png\" /></figure><h3>Don’t Wait to Be Invited</h3><p>People can hold themselves back by thinking it’s not their place to take on organizational initiatives. Whether they think it’s not their responsibility or not in their authority, they can find reasons not to try to tackle large problems.</p><p>For a while, I had a pretty rigid hierarchical view of how organizations worked. I believed that each role had a specific area of responsibility and authority, and operating outside of those bounds wasn’t appropriate. So when I saw problems in organization wide strategy or gaps in major processes, I’d complain to my manager or leadership.</p><p>And I got frustrated, because the problems would generally persist, and it felt like nothing that I said mattered.</p><p>More than anything, my beliefs about having the <em>authority</em> to drive large initiatives was holding me back. I had no problems driving changes for my team or even working with my peers to make small changes in our process. But larger, organizational changes felt outside of the authority of a simple team-level Product Manager.</p><p>Talking to my manager and other leaders helped me to challenge this thinking. Yes, there were some decisions that would be difficult to involve myself in. But there were countless other initiatives and problems that needed driving that any individual could take on.</p><p>And there wasn’t any magical authority that came with moving up to a higher level that suddenly changed how things needed to get done. I wanted to be in a position where people would have to listen to me. But being a great leader isn’t about relying on your title to ram changes through; it’s about building trust through effective collaboration and swaying hearts and minds to align on goals and a direction.</p><p>It was obvious in hindsight, but it was helpful having someone point it out to me: I didn’t need the title to do the work.</p><p>But why should I take on all this extra work if I couldn’t be certain it would mean a promotion?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TuPGcKTA2DNhEYGZkiu_8w.png\" /></figure><h3>Don’t Look For Guarantees</h3><p>Moving into a leadership position can require taking on a number of responsibilities above and beyond your day to day role. And few people embrace the idea of doing extra work without some kind of compensation and recognition. I often looked at it from a transactional perspective: if I did this work, was I going to get promoted? How many features did I need to launch? How many initiatives did I need to drive? How many people did I need to mentor?</p><p>It usually doesn’t work like that. Your manager and senior leaders won’t make such promises, because 1) these roles are filled based on business needs, and 2) just because you checked some boxes doesn’t mean you&#39;ve proven you can thrive in the new position.</p><p>People need to trust that you have the attitude, aptitude, and capacity to be great at the next level. They need to believe that they should continue to invest in you. There are a lot qualities that your leadership team is looking for. Many of which they won’t or don’t know how to articulate. Doing the work provides an opportunity for you to actually discover, practice, and demonstrate those qualities.</p><p>And if you really want to be in the role, you should want to do the work. If your only interest in taking on a complex cross-organizational initiative is to have the title, then you’re going about this backwards. Moving into the role makes those kinds of challenges your job. If you don’t enjoy mentoring and coaching other PMs, why do you want to be a manager? If you don’t embrace the value and impact of driving alignment with multiple leaders, why do you want to make that your day to day responsibility?</p><p>If you want to do the work, you should do the work.</p><blockquote>How am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zY9m8k8qs4Y17q2VTUqq2g.png\" /></figure><h3>Embrace the Uncertainty</h3><p>The initiatives and problems you drive as a Product Leader are much more complex, much less certain. Building confidence and alignment across an organization in the face of such uncertainty is difficult. But it’s all the more important because of that uncertainty.</p><p>When taking on larger initiatives — whether new product discovery, a major operational shift, or a change in strategy — there is not going to be an obvious right answer. You may never know the correct answer. No one will. But a plan needs to be made, and the job is creating and selling it in a way that folks will believe in it.</p><p>On larger organizational initiatives, you will rarely be able to get to the same level of confidence as you were able to reach at the team level. There are too many variables. Once you involve multiple products and multiple teams, the complexities increase exponentially. Greater dependencies between teams means reduced confidence in technical approaches and delivery dates. Making a change to your product offerings can have ripple effects on customer purchasing decisions.</p><p>Driving bigger changes means accepting you won’t have the perfect data to justify a decision. Instead, it increases the need to build confidence in that decision across an organization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CU8EWiyjstDHq2qEZwqKdg.png\" /></figure><h4>Collaborate to Build Confidence</h4><p>Collaborating with more leaders reduces uncertainty. It increases the likelihood that a plan will succeed. And critically, it increases other people’s confidence in the plan.</p><p>As a seasoned Product Manager, you should have honed your product instincts to identify major opportunities and risks. Other leaders across your organization likewise will have built up their own instincts that you should leverage.</p><p>Their instincts and experience can help fill gaps in your knowledge or identify risks that you didn’t see. They’ll connect you with data or individuals who can answer critical questions. And they’ll help you build a stronger case to get buy in from other stakeholders and the leadership team.</p><p>Effective collaboration is the foundation for the success of any major initiative. And the bigger the initiative, the more important that collaboration is.</p><blockquote>I can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZJSuvj6kiP05gvNXr_H5uw.png\" /></figure><h3>Prioritizing the Team and the Organization</h3><p>Leaders often have to make hard prioritization decisions that impact multiple teams. Sometimes one team’s goals has to be deprioritized in favor of a more critical organizational goal. It’s not pretty, and it can hurt morale— but it sometimes needs to be done.</p><p>Learning how to balance the needs of the organization against the needs of your immediate team can be a difficult challenge. But your job isn’t just to be a great Product Manager for your team; it’s to be a great Product Manager for your organization. As a Product Leader, you need to prioritize your time and your teams’ time wisely to ensure the highest impact for the business and your customers.</p><p>There are two key challenges here:</p><ul><li>Putting the organization’s objectives ahead of an individual team’s objectives.</li><li>Balancing your time and effort between serving the organization vs. serving the team.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yeVVdAzet8iyrUWO-gI2Bg.png\" /></figure><h4>Prioritizing the Roadmap to Serve the Organization</h4><p>There are often opportunities to support goals that don’t directly benefit your team, or slows your team down from achieving its goals. But taking these opportunities can drive better outcomes for the business, rather than if every team operated selfishly towards their own goals.</p><p>My team was working on a brand new product area, while most of the rest of the organization was working on <a href=\"https://construction.autodesk.com/\">unifying our core products</a>.

In this series, I’m tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to become a Product Leader. This article focuses on shifting one’s perspective from a team level Product Manager to an organization wide Product Leader.\nThe biggest obstacle I faced when trying to move from Product Manager to Product Leader was my own mindset. I had a number of attitudes and beliefs that were counterproductive and held me back:\n\nLeadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.\nHow am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.\nI can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.\n\nYou may or may not suffer from any of these misconceptions. But I’ve seen other experienced individual contributors making the same mistakes, banging their heads against the ceiling of management and leadership.\nChanging my perspective was difficult and is an ongoing struggle. But pushing myself to a new mindset has made all the difference in my ability to be a leader.\nLeadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.\n\nDon’t Wait to Be Invited\nPeople can hold themselves back by thinking it’s not their place to take on organizational initiatives. Whether they think it’s not their responsibility or not in their authority, they can find reasons not to try to tackle large problems.\nFor a while, I had a pretty rigid hierarchical view of how organizations worked. I believed that each role had a specific area of responsibility and authority, and operating outside of those bounds wasn’t appropriate. So when I saw problems in organization wide strategy or gaps in major processes, I’d complain to my manager or leadership.\nAnd I got frustrated, because the problems would generally persist, and it felt like nothing that I said mattered.\nMore than anything, my beliefs about having the authority to drive large initiatives was holding me back. I had no problems driving changes for my team or even working with my peers to make small changes in our process. But larger, organizational changes felt outside of the authority of a simple team-level Product Manager.\nTalking to my manager and other leaders helped me to challenge this thinking. Yes, there were some decisions that would be difficult to involve myself in. But there were countless other initiatives and problems that needed driving that any individual could take on.\nAnd there wasn’t any magical authority that came with moving up to a higher level that suddenly changed how things needed to get done. I wanted to be in a position where people would have to listen to me. But being a great leader isn’t about relying on your title to ram changes through; it’s about building trust through effective collaboration and swaying hearts and minds to align on goals and a direction.\nIt was obvious in hindsight, but it was helpful having someone point it out to me: I didn’t need the title to do the work.\nBut why should I take on all this extra work if I couldn’t be certain it would mean a promotion?\n\nDon’t Look For Guarantees\nMoving into a leadership position can require taking on a number of responsibilities above and beyond your day to day role. And few people embrace the idea of doing extra work without some kind of compensation and recognition. I often looked at it from a transactional perspective: if I did this work, was I going to get promoted? How many features did I need to launch? How many initiatives did I need to drive? How many people did I need to mentor?\nIt usually doesn’t work like that. Your manager and senior leaders won’t make such promises, because 1) these roles are filled based on business needs, and 2) just because you checked some boxes doesn’t mean you've proven you can thrive in the new position.\nPeople need to trust that you have the attitude, aptitude, and capacity to be great at the next level. They need to believe that they should continue to invest in you. There are a lot qualities that your leadership team is looking for. Many of which they won’t or don’t know how to articulate. Doing the work provides an opportunity for you to actually discover, practice, and demonstrate those qualities.\nAnd if you really want to be in the role, you should want to do the work. If your only interest in taking on a complex cross-organizational initiative is to have the title, then you’re going about this backwards. Moving into the role makes those kinds of challenges your job. If you don’t enjoy mentoring and coaching other PMs, why do you want to be a manager? If you don’t embrace the value and impact of driving alignment with multiple leaders, why do you want to make that your day to day responsibility?\nIf you want to do the work, you should do the work.\nHow am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.\n\nEmbrace the Uncertainty\nThe initiatives and problems you drive as a Product Leader are much more complex, much less certain. Building confidence and alignment across an organization in the face of such uncertainty is difficult. But it’s all the more important because of that uncertainty.\nWhen taking on larger initiatives — whether new product discovery, a major operational shift, or a change in strategy — there is not going to be an obvious right answer. You may never know the correct answer. No one will. But a plan needs to be made, and the job is creating and selling it in a way that folks will believe in it.\nOn larger organizational initiatives, you will rarely be able to get to the same level of confidence as you were able to reach at the team level. There are too many variables. Once you involve multiple products and multiple teams, the complexities increase exponentially. Greater dependencies between teams means reduced confidence in technical approaches and delivery dates. Making a change to your product offerings can have ripple effects on customer purchasing decisions.\nDriving bigger changes means accepting you won’t have the perfect data to justify a decision. Instead, it increases the need to build confidence in that decision across an organization.\n\nCollaborate to Build Confidence\nCollaborating with more leaders reduces uncertainty. It increases the likelihood that a plan will succeed. And critically, it increases other people’s confidence in the plan.\nAs a seasoned Product Manager, you should have honed your product instincts to identify major opportunities and risks. Other leaders across your organization likewise will have built up their own instincts that you should leverage.\nTheir instincts and experience can help fill gaps in your knowledge or identify risks that you didn’t see. They’ll connect you with data or individuals who can answer critical questions. And they’ll help you build a stronger case to get buy in from other stakeholders and the leadership team.\nEffective collaboration is the foundation for the success of any major initiative. And the bigger the initiative, the more important that collaboration is.\nI can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.\n\nPrioritizing the Team and the Organization\nLeaders often have to make hard prioritization decisions that impact multiple teams. Sometimes one team’s goals has to be deprioritized in favor of a more critical organizational goal. It’s not pretty, and it can hurt morale— but it sometimes needs to be done.\nLearning how to balance the needs of the organization against the needs of your immediate team can be a difficult challenge. But your job isn’t just to be a great Product Manager for your team; it’s to be a great Product Manager for your organization. As a Product Leader, you need to prioritize your time and your teams’ time wisely to ensure the highest impact for the business and your customers.\nThere are two key challenges here:\n\nPutting the organization’s objectives ahead of an individual team’s objectives.\nBalancing your time and effort between serving the organization vs. serving the team.\n\nPrioritizing the Roadmap to Serve the Organization\nThere are often opportunities to support goals that don’t directly benefit your team, or slows your team down from achieving its goals. But taking these opportunities can drive better outcomes for the business, rather than if every team operated selfishly towards their own goals.\nMy team was working on a brand new product area, while most of the rest of the organization was working on unifying our core products. Our project was new and shiny, serving the goals of exciting our customers and driving new business opportunities. By contrast, the rest of the org’s work was less glamorous, but absolutely essential to the overall success of the business.\nOne of the teams we were partnering with — and were heavily dependent on — was falling behind on its roadmap. This team’s product area was a foundational piece of the unified offering, and a platform on which many other teams would be developing.\nWe could have protected our own goals and roadmap — eating down other features in our backlog while we waited for them to catch up, or building on their platform with narrowly scoped solutions that worked only for us. Instead we collaborated with them to take on several initiatives that unblocked our team but would also serve to expand their platform for other teams.\nWe cost ourselves some of our velocity towards our own goals, but we accelerated adoption across the organization. And we demonstrated that we could put the good of the organization ahead of ourselves.\nAn important part of making this kind of decision is being highly visible. Your manager and leaders should have insight into the decision making process to ensure that this is the best course of action for the business. And your leaders should be fully aware that you’ve put the needs of the organization first.\n\nPrioritizing Your Time to Serve the Organization\nAs a Product Manager, it can be difficult to move your focus away from the team and towards side projects. But your time is a valuable resource and prioritizing that time ruthlessly is a necessary part of being a Product Leader. Over-investing in a single team becomes a waste of your skills as you grow more seasoned and capable of impacting an organization.\nI had to find my own balance in taking on side projects for the organization and doing the work for my team.

Unintentional test kitchens for products occur when a company realizes they have created a product to solve a problem for themselves that could solve the same or similar problem for others. I refer to examples of both below.</p><p>If test kitchens make so much sense in other settings to evaluate and evolve new equipment, tooling, systems, processes, and products why haven’t they been leveraged more with software products?</p><p>One reason is that intentional software product test kitchens are often viewed as an extra expense and operational overhead. Do we really need to set this up? Is it really going to be worth the time, money, and effort? Can’t we validate what we need to, without creating the test kitchen? These, and more, get asked frequently when discussing test kitchens so the idea of implementing one for a software product takes on a negative tone and perspective almost immediately. The test kitchen gets seen as an anchor rather than as an accelerant. A hindrance that keeps a company from getting a product to market sooner. Why not just build it and get it into customers hands? Keep in mind that behind this question is almost always a vague plan of product awareness and distribution. Test kitchens have been used effectively in almost every physical product and process industry because these product creators know the value of testing and iterating on a product and process in a real-world environment to remove inefficiencies and points of friction before more releasing more broadly.</p><p>Software product creators should be adopting the physical product and process creator perspective of using a test kitchen because it works. Software products too frequently get created with too much user and process friction because the products aren’t being used in real life and work circumstances. If you want to create and release software products that better align with a user’s problem, workflow, and have less friction then do so in a test kitchen.</p><p>Here are some of examples of software products being created in test kitchens and why these products and companies have been successful and will likely continue to succeed:</p><h3><strong>giftHEALTH</strong></h3><p>giftHEALTH is creating a new Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) product and has recently raised a $5 million seed round. The most interesting thing about giftHEALTH to me is their decision to buy and operate a pharmacy as a test kitchen for their PBM product.</p><p>I’ve been able to get to know founder Nick Potts over the past few years and he credits their test kitchen in helping to speed up their product development, create more empathy between the product team and users, and to reduce friction in the product faster than they otherwise would be able to.</p><p>giftHEALTH’s pharmacy test kitchen has also been instrumental in helping to raise investment fairly quickly because investors are emboldened by the company’s ability to create the best product by testing and iterating on it using their own pharmacy as a test kitchen.</p><blockquote>“Having our own pharmacy gives us firsthand exposure to the pharmacy and patient experience. We have a direct feedback loop with our pharmacy for determining areas of improvement and quickly testing new innovative solutions. This sets us up for launching a refined product experience for all of our partners.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>Daniel Dalton, Director of Product at giftHEALTH</em></blockquote><h3><strong>Bevy</strong></h3><p>Bevy is a platform for organizations to facilitate and manage their communities. Bevy recently raised over $40m to continue to grow the company.</p><p>Bevy’s growth is interesting, and the team has been executing well, but what I’m most intrigued by and impressed with is how the company got started and the genesis of the product. And I have had a birds-eye of it happening, which has been fun.</p><p>Bevy’s product was unintentionally incubated through a sister organization, Startup Grind. Startup Grind is a global community that helps to inform, support, and bring together entrepreneurs through local chapters and events. Startup Grind created a product to facilitate and manage the Startup Grind community. As the Startup Grind community continued to grow and evolve the product did as well. The product was initially called the Startup Grind Dashboard. Yep, creative naming.</p><p>Turns out that as the Startup Grind Dashboard continued to evolve and become more robust to support Startup Grind’s community management needs, the Startup Grind leadership team realized the product might be able to be used by other organizations to manage their communities. They were right and now that’s Bevy.</p><p>Startup Grind served as an unintentional test kitchen for the product that eventually become the Bevy platform. Startup Grind’s community management needs facilitated the Startup Grind dashboard to get created and evolved inside of a real-world usage environment. There would be no Bevy platform and no Bevy company if it hadn’t been for Startup Grind serving as a test kitchen, even if unknowingly.</p><h3><strong>Hopewell</strong></h3><p>Hopewell is helping companies to empower their team members to do their best work by providing a re-designed work experience and environment that supports them.</p><p>Hopewell started with a physical lab in Columbus and have now opened a second one in Louisville. The physical lab helps Hopewell showcase what can be done from a physical perspective to create an environment for focused or collaborative work. The labs are also a great test kitchen for Hopewell to evaluate technologies and to gather data on work preferences and what they need to support their best work.</p><p>With the pandemic hastening the need for companies to better understand and support their team members working from anywhere also comes the need to rethink the traditional work environment. Hopewell is using its labs to expose companies to new perspectives around space and tools to foster a better team member experience.</p><p>The future of work is the present and the best way to align what people need to do their best work is to do inside of labs where different environments and tools can be tested and evolved.</p><h3><strong>SureImpact</strong></h3><p>A professional services firm wanting to have a product and to have the elusive, but highly desirable, recurring revenue is common. What isn’t common is a services firm being able to pull it off. SureImpact is a new software product company out of decade old services firm that is doing just that.</p><p>Services firms have an advantage over other companies when it comes to a test kitchen environment because the services firms that have the opportunity to productize some aspect of their process or intellectual property means they have a built-in, legacy test kitchen.</p><p>Services firms that successfully leverage their existing and past clients to become early users and advisers while creating a new product can create an early product faster and more in alignment with client needs than having to do so from scratch. Services firms can integrate the new product into their existing client relationships and workflows by demonstrating a value-add to their existing clients, while they are marketing the new product to potential new customers. With the ability to use current clients to help shape the product and get early product validation, there is little need to bring any outsiders in on the early process. This accelerates the early product creation and validation cycles. It is also much easier to iterate with existing clients that a services firm knows they can trust and rely on when collaborating on the functionality and user experience of a new product.</p><p>Products like SureImpact that are created inside of an existing services firm’s operation have many advantages that come from incubation inside the firm.</p><h3><strong>Common Test Kitchen Traits</strong></h3><p>Creating a new product in a test kitchen has several advantages and when possible, a test kitchen environment should be setup. As described above, test kitchens for new software products can take on many different forms and types but they all have these attributes in common:</p><ul><li>A test kitchen is <strong>owned </strong>by the company creating the new product. A test kitchen isn’t a focus group exercise or some arm’s length research endeavor. For a test kitchen to be effective in creating a new software product it needs to be part of the company creating the product.</li><li>A test kitchen is <strong>valued, invested, and supported </strong>as if it is crucial part of the company…because it is. A test kitchen that is a just for show, like many corporate innovation labs, aren’t really test kitchens.</li><li>A test kitchen is as close to <strong>real use</strong> as possible. For a test kitchen to provide as much insight and value as possible it has to be as real life as possible. In all the examples provided above they were and are test kitchens that work and provide value for customers or clients.</li><li>The best test kitchens can <strong>live on their own.</strong> Another thing all of the above examples have in common and good test kitchens for product creation do, is that the test kitchen can and often does operate as its own entity. Bevy now operates apart from Startup Grind. giftHEALTH’s pharmacy operates as a fully functioning pharmacy. SureImpact is able to serve clients separate from its services firm Measurement Resources. You can be a customer of Hopewell’s software product without being a member of their lab.</li></ul><p>There are key stakeholder benefits to a test kitchen as part of product development as well. Customers will value the product having been designed and developed as close to their real world as possible. This lowers the risk associated to implementing a new product. Investors, if that investment makes sense for a product and company, will be intrigued by the customer product fit established by leveraging a test kitchen to create a product. A test kitchen establishes for both customers and investors that the creators of a product understand the problem and how to solve it in practical terms.</p><p>Product creators are always looking for ways to quickly test, validate, and iterate. A test kitchen provides the platform to do so based on real operational and service’s needs. There is no better and more intimate way to understand the job to be done than to build a product to support the job to be done in real-time. More startups and corporate innovation teams creating products should give strong consideration how they can implement a test kitchen to support their product creation.</p><p>If you are in the process of, or considering, building a digital product and you need technical assistance, consider partnering with <a href=\"https://awh.net/insights/post?post=affordance-in-design\">AWH</a>.

The most interesting thing about giftHEALTH to me is their decision to buy and operate a pharmacy as a test kitchen for their PBM product.\nI’ve been able to get to know founder Nick Potts over the past few years and he credits their test kitchen in helping to speed up their product development, create more empathy between the product team and users, and to reduce friction in the product faster than they otherwise would be able to.\ngiftHEALTH’s pharmacy test kitchen has also been instrumental in helping to raise investment fairly quickly because investors are emboldened by the company’s ability to create the best product by testing and iterating on it using their own pharmacy as a test kitchen.\n“Having our own pharmacy gives us firsthand exposure to the pharmacy and patient experience. We have a direct feedback loop with our pharmacy for determining areas of improvement and quickly testing new innovative solutions. This sets us up for launching a refined product experience for all of our partners.”\nDaniel Dalton, Director of Product at giftHEALTH\nBevy\nBevy is a platform for organizations to facilitate and manage their communities. Bevy recently raised over $40m to continue to grow the company.\nBevy’s growth is interesting, and the team has been executing well, but what I’m most intrigued by and impressed with is how the company got started and the genesis of the product. And I have had a birds-eye of it happening, which has been fun.\nBevy’s product was unintentionally incubated through a sister organization, Startup Grind. Startup Grind is a global community that helps to inform, support, and bring together entrepreneurs through local chapters and events. Startup Grind created a product to facilitate and manage the Startup Grind community. As the Startup Grind community continued to grow and evolve the product did as well. The product was initially called the Startup Grind Dashboard. Yep, creative naming.\nTurns out that as the Startup Grind Dashboard continued to evolve and become more robust to support Startup Grind’s community management needs, the Startup Grind leadership team realized the product might be able to be used by other organizations to manage their communities. They were right and now that’s Bevy.\nStartup Grind served as an unintentional test kitchen for the product that eventually become the Bevy platform. Startup Grind’s community management needs facilitated the Startup Grind dashboard to get created and evolved inside of a real-world usage environment. There would be no Bevy platform and no Bevy company if it hadn’t been for Startup Grind serving as a test kitchen, even if unknowingly.\nHopewell\nHopewell is helping companies to empower their team members to do their best work by providing a re-designed work experience and environment that supports them.\nHopewell started with a physical lab in Columbus and have now opened a second one in Louisville. The physical lab helps Hopewell showcase what can be done from a physical perspective to create an environment for focused or collaborative work. The labs are also a great test kitchen for Hopewell to evaluate technologies and to gather data on work preferences and what they need to support their best work.\nWith the pandemic hastening the need for companies to better understand and support their team members working from anywhere also comes the need to rethink the traditional work environment. Hopewell is using its labs to expose companies to new perspectives around space and tools to foster a better team member experience.\nThe future of work is the present and the best way to align what people need to do their best work is to do inside of labs where different environments and tools can be tested and evolved.\nSureImpact\nA professional services firm wanting to have a product and to have the elusive, but highly desirable, recurring revenue is common. What isn’t common is a services firm being able to pull it off. SureImpact is a new software product company out of decade old services firm that is doing just that.\nServices firms have an advantage over other companies when it comes to a test kitchen environment because the services firms that have the opportunity to productize some aspect of their process or intellectual property means they have a built-in, legacy test kitchen.\nServices firms that successfully leverage their existing and past clients to become early users and advisers while creating a new product can create an early product faster and more in alignment with client needs than having to do so from scratch. Services firms can integrate the new product into their existing client relationships and workflows by demonstrating a value-add to their existing clients, while they are marketing the new product to potential new customers. With the ability to use current clients to help shape the product and get early product validation, there is little need to bring any outsiders in on the early process. This accelerates the early product creation and validation cycles. It is also much easier to iterate with existing clients that a services firm knows they can trust and rely on when collaborating on the functionality and user experience of a new product.\nProducts like SureImpact that are created inside of an existing services firm’s operation have many advantages that come from incubation inside the firm.\nCommon Test Kitchen Traits\nCreating a new product in a test kitchen has several advantages and when possible, a test kitchen environment should be setup. As described above, test kitchens for new software products can take on many different forms and types but they all have these attributes in common:\n\nA test kitchen is owned by the company creating the new product. A test kitchen isn’t a focus group exercise or some arm’s length research endeavor. For a test kitchen to be effective in creating a new software product it needs to be part of the company creating the product.\nA test kitchen is valued, invested, and supported as if it is crucial part of the company…because it is. A test kitchen that is a just for show, like many corporate innovation labs, aren’t really test kitchens.\nA test kitchen is as close to real use as possible. For a test kitchen to provide as much insight and value as possible it has to be as real life as possible. In all the examples provided above they were and are test kitchens that work and provide value for customers or clients.\nThe best test kitchens can live on their own. Another thing all of the above examples have in common and good test kitchens for product creation do, is that the test kitchen can and often does operate as its own entity. Bevy now operates apart from Startup Grind. giftHEALTH’s pharmacy operates as a fully functioning pharmacy. SureImpact is able to serve clients separate from its services firm Measurement Resources. You can be a customer of Hopewell’s software product without being a member of their lab.\n\nThere are key stakeholder benefits to a test kitchen as part of product development as well. Customers will value the product having been designed and developed as close to their real world as possible. This lowers the risk associated to implementing a new product. Investors, if that investment makes sense for a product and company, will be intrigued by the customer product fit established by leveraging a test kitchen to create a product. A test kitchen establishes for both customers and investors that the creators of a product understand the problem and how to solve it in practical terms.\nProduct creators are always looking for ways to quickly test, validate, and iterate. A test kitchen provides the platform to do so based on real operational and service’s needs. There is no better and more intimate way to understand the job to be done than to build a product to support the job to be done in real-time. More startups and corporate innovation teams creating products should give strong consideration how they can implement a test kitchen to support their product creation.\nIf you are in the process of, or considering, building a digital product and you need technical assistance, consider partnering with AWH. We partner with clients to build complex digital products that have the power to transform industries.\n\nHow Software Products are Created in Test Kitchens was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Ryan Frederick","guid":"https://medium.com/p/a62028ae6f65","categories":["product-development","product","startup","product-design","product-management"],"isoDate":"2021-05-25T16:06:47.000Z"},{"creator":"Aytekin Tank","title":"The New Rules for Emailing","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/the-new-rules-for-emailing-72abcaaacab5?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Tue, 25 May 2021 15:40:58 GMT","dc:creator":"Aytekin Tank","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-new-rules-for-emailing-72abcaaacab5?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1920/1*yRMwUMZj32Lm1aLNqC85DQ.jpeg\" width=\"1920\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">&#x201C;Sounds good,&#x201D; I wrote to a colleague, then hit send.</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-new-rules-for-emailing-72abcaaacab5?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\">Continue reading on The Startup »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"“Sounds good,” I wrote to a colleague, then hit send.\nContinue reading on The Startup »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/72abcaaacab5","categories":["life-lessons","entrepreneurship","business","technology","productivity"],"isoDate":"2021-05-25T15:40:58.000Z"},{"creator":"The Startup","title":"1.

We do this in ways we are aware of, and ways that we aren’t. Corporations are eager to take advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for instance, NumberEight, a startup, that, according to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/companies-track-phones-movements-target-ads/\">Wired</a>, “helps apps infer user activity based on data from a smartphone’s sensors: whether they’re running or seated, near a park or museum, driving or riding a train.” New services based on such technology, “will combine what they know about a user’s activity on their own apps with information on what they’re doing physically at the time.” With this information, “instead of building a profile to target, say, women over 35, a service could target ads to  ‘early risers.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such ambitions are widespread. As <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/05/getting-ai-to-scale\">this recent Harvard Business Review article puts</a> it, “Most CEOs recognize that artificial intelligence has the potential to completely change how organizations work. They can envision a future in which, for example, retailers deliver individualized products before customers even request them—perhaps on the very same day those products are made.” As corporations use AI in more and more distinct domains, the article foretells, “their AI capabilities will rapidly compound, and they’ll find that the future they imagined is actually closer than it once appeared.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even today, let alone in such a future, technology can completely obliterate privacy. Coming up with laws and policies to stop it from doing so is a vital task for governments.As the Biden administration and Congress contemplate federal privacy legislation they must not succumb to a common fallacy. Laws guarding the privacy of people’s data are not only about protecting individuals. They are also about protecting our rights as members of groups—as part of society as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The harm to any one individual in a group that results from a violation of privacy rights might be relatively small or hard to pin down, but the harm to the group as a whole can be profound. Say Amazon uses its data on consumer behavior to figure out which products are worth copying and then undercuts the manufacturers of products it sells, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag\">like shoes or camera bags</a>. Though the immediate harm is to the shoemaker or the camera-bag maker, the longer-term—and ultimately more lasting—harm is to consumers, who are robbed over the long run of the choices that come from transacting in a truly open and equitable marketplace. And whereas the shoemaker or camera-bag manufacturer can try to take legal action, it’s much tougher for consumers to demonstrate how Amazon’s practices harm them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a tricky concept to understand. Class action lawsuits, where many individuals join together even though each might have suffered only a small harm, are a good conceptual analogy. Big tech companies understand the commercial benefits they can derive from analyzing the data of groups while superficially protecting the data of individuals through <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/technology/differential-privacy/\">mathematical techniques like differential privacy</a>. But regulators continue to focus on protecting individuals or, at best, protected classes like people of particular genders, ages, ethnicities, or sexual orientations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an algorithm discriminates against people by sorting them into groups that do not fall into these protected classes, antidiscrimination laws don’t apply in the United States. (Profiling techniques like those Facebook uses to help machine-learning models sort users are probably illegal under European Union data protection laws, but this has not yet been litigated.) Many people will not even know that they were profiled or discriminated against, which makes it tough to bring legal action. They no longer feel the unfairness, the injustice, firsthand—and that has historically been a precondition to launching a claim.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/0685a4ba-7b0b-442b-b38e-3f73101a6943\">Individuals</a> should not have to fight for their data privacy rights and be responsible for every consequence of their digital actions. Consider an analogy: people have a right to safe drinking water, but they aren’t urged to exercise that right by checking the quality of the water with a pipette every time they have a drink at the tap. Instead, regulatory agencies act on everyone’s behalf to ensure that all our water is safe. The same must be done for digital privacy: it isn’t something the average user is, or should be expected to be, personally competent to protect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two parallel approaches that should be pursued to protect the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is better use of class or group actions, otherwise known as collective redress actions. Historically, these have been limited in Europe, but in November 2020 the European parliament <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/class-action-lawsuits-to-become-eu-law/a-55711222\">passed a measure</a> that requires all 27 EU member states to implement measures allowing for collective redress actions across the region. Compared with the US, the EU has stronger laws protecting consumer data and promoting competition, so class or group action lawsuits in Europe can be a powerful tool for lawyers and activists to force big tech companies to change their behavior even in cases where the per-person damages would be very low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Class action lawsuits have most often been used in the US to seek financial damages, but they can also be used to force changes in policy and practice. They can work hand in hand with campaigns to change public opinion, especially in consumer cases (for example, by forcing Big Tobacco to admit to the link between smoking and cancer, or by paving the way for car seatbelt laws). They are powerful tools when there are thousands, if not millions, of similar individual harms, which add up to help prove causation. Part of the problem is getting the right information to sue in the first place. Government efforts, like a lawsuit brought against Facebook in December by the<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-privacy-on-collision-course/\"> Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a group of 46 states</a>, are crucial. As the tech journalist Gilad Edelman puts it, “According to the lawsuits, the erosion of user privacy over time is a form of consumer harm—a social network that protects user data less is an inferior product—that tips Facebook from a mere monopoly to an illegal one.” In the US, as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/google-facebook-private-antitrust.html\">recently reported</a>, private lawsuits, including class actions, often “lean on evidence unearthed by the government investigations.” In the EU, however, it’s the other way around: private lawsuits can open up the possibility of regulatory action, which is constrained by the gap between EU-wide laws and national regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to the second approach: a little-known 2016 French law called the Digital Republic Bill. The <a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichLoiPubliee.do?idDocument=JORFDOLE000031589829&amp;type=general&amp;legislature=14\">Digital Republic Bill</a> is one of the few modern laws focused on automated decision making. The law currently applies only to administrative decisions taken by public-sector algorithmic systems. But it provides a sketch for what future laws could look like. It says that the source code behind such systems must be made available to the public. Anyone can request that code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, the law enables advocacy organizations to request information on the functioning of an algorithm and the source code behind it even if they don’t represent a specific individual or claimant who is allegedly harmed. The need to find a “perfect plaintiff” who can prove harm in order to file a suit makes it very difficult to tackle the systemic issues that cause collective data harms. Laure Lucchesi, the director of Etalab, a French government office in charge of overseeing the bill, says that the law’s focus on algorithmic accountability was ahead of its time. Other laws, like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), focus too heavily on individual consent and privacy. But both the data and the algorithms need to be regulated.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-right is-style-large\"><p>The need to find a “perfect plaintiff” who can prove harm in order to file a suit makes it very difficult to tackle the systemic issues that cause collective data harms. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89_GV053CiI\">Apple</a> promises in one advertisement: “Right now, there is more private information on your phone than in your home. Your locations, your messages, your heart rate after a run. These are private things.

The notion that your phone is the digital equivalent of your filing cabinet is a convenient illusion. Companies actually care little about your personal data; that is why they can pretend to lock it in a box. The value lies in the inferences drawn from your interactions, which are also stored on your phone—but that data does not belong to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s acquisition of Fitbit is another example. Google promises “not to use Fitbit data for advertising,” but the lucrative predictions Google needs aren’t dependent on individual data. <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/googlefitbit-will-monetise-health-data-and-harm-consumers\">As a group of European economists argue</a>d in a recent paper put out by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a think tank in London, “it is enough for Google to correlate aggregate health outcomes with non-health outcomes for even a subset of Fitbit users that did not opt out from some use of using their data, to then predict health outcomes (and thus ad targeting possibilities) for&nbsp;all&nbsp;non-Fitbit users (billions of them).” The Google-Fitbit deal is essentially a group data deal. It positions Google in a key market for heath data while enabling it to triangulate different data sets and make money from the inferences used by health and insurance markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What policymakers must do</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Draft bills have sought to fill this gap in the United States. In 2019 Senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden introduced an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2231\">Algorithmic Accountability Act</a>, which subsequently stalled in Congress. The act would have required firms to undertake algorithmic impact assessments in certain situations to check for bias or discrimination. But in the US this crucial issue is more likely to be taken up first in laws applying to specific sectors such as health care, where the danger of algorithmic bias has been magnified by the pandemic’s disparate impacts on US population groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late January, the <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/5/protecting-civil-liberties-during-covid-19-warner-blumental-eshoo-schakowsky-delbene-introduce-the-public-health-privacy-act\">Public Health Emergency Privacy Act</a> was reintroduced to the Senate and House of Representatives by Senators Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal. This act would ensure that data collected for public health purposes is not used for any other purpose. It would prohibit the use of health data for discriminatory, unrelated, or intrusive purposes, including commercial advertising, e-commerce, or efforts to control access to employment, finance, insurance, housing, or education. This would be a great start. Going further, a law that applies to all algorithmic decision making should, inspired by the French example, focus on hard accountability, strong regulatory oversight of data-driven decision making, and the ability to audit and inspect algorithmic decisions and their impact on society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three elements are needed to ensure hard accountability: (1) clear transparency about where and when automated decisions take place and how they affect people and groups, (2) the public’s right to offer meaningful input and call on those in authority to justify their decisions, and (3) the ability to enforce sanctions. Crucially, policymakers will need to decide, as has been recently suggested in the EU, what constitutes a “high risk” algorithm that should meet a higher standard of scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clear Transparency</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus should be on public scrutiny of automated decision making and the types of transparency that lead to accountability.

This “right to demand answers” should not be limited to consultative participation, where people are asked for their input and officials move on. It should include empowered participation, where public input is mandated prior to the rollout of high-risks algorithms in both the public and private sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sanctions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Finally, the power to sanction is key for these reforms to succeed and for accountability to be achieved. It should be mandatory to establish auditing requirements for data targeting, verification, and curation, to equip auditors with this baseline knowledge, and to empower oversight bodies to enforce sanctions, not only to remedy harm after the fact but to prevent it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue of collective data-driven harms affects everyone. A Public Health Emergency Privacy Act is a first step. Congress should then use the lessons from implementing that act to develop laws that focus specifically on collective data rights. Only through such action can the US avoid situations where inferences drawn from the data companies collect haunt people’s ability to access housing, jobs, credit, and other opportunities for years to come.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Every person engaged with the networked world constantly creates rivers of data. We do this in ways we are aware of, and ways that we aren’t. Corporations are eager to take advantage.\nTake, for instance, NumberEight, a startup, that, according to Wired, “helps apps infer user activity based on data from a smartphone’s sensors: whether they’re running or seated, near a park or museum, driving or riding a train.” New services based on such technology, “will combine what they know about a user’s activity on their own apps with information on what they’re doing physically at the time.” With this information, “instead of building a profile to target, say, women over 35, a service could target ads to  ‘early risers.’”\nSuch ambitions are widespread. As this recent Harvard Business Review article puts it, “Most CEOs recognize that artificial intelligence has the potential to completely change how organizations work. They can envision a future in which, for example, retailers deliver individualized products before customers even request them—perhaps on the very same day those products are made.” As corporations use AI in more and more distinct domains, the article foretells, “their AI capabilities will rapidly compound, and they’ll find that the future they imagined is actually closer than it once appeared.”\nEven today, let alone in such a future, technology can completely obliterate privacy. Coming up with laws and policies to stop it from doing so is a vital task for governments.As the Biden administration and Congress contemplate federal privacy legislation they must not succumb to a common fallacy. Laws guarding the privacy of people’s data are not only about protecting individuals. They are also about protecting our rights as members of groups—as part of society as a whole.\nThe harm to any one individual in a group that results from a violation of privacy rights might be relatively small or hard to pin down, but the harm to the group as a whole can be profound. Say Amazon uses its data on consumer behavior to figure out which products are worth copying and then undercuts the manufacturers of products it sells, like shoes or camera bags. Though the immediate harm is to the shoemaker or the camera-bag maker, the longer-term—and ultimately more lasting—harm is to consumers, who are robbed over the long run of the choices that come from transacting in a truly open and equitable marketplace. And whereas the shoemaker or camera-bag manufacturer can try to take legal action, it’s much tougher for consumers to demonstrate how Amazon’s practices harm them.\nThis can be a tricky concept to understand. Class action lawsuits, where many individuals join together even though each might have suffered only a small harm, are a good conceptual analogy. Big tech companies understand the commercial benefits they can derive from analyzing the data of groups while superficially protecting the data of individuals through mathematical techniques like differential privacy. But regulators continue to focus on protecting individuals or, at best, protected classes like people of particular genders, ages, ethnicities, or sexual orientations.\nIf an algorithm discriminates against people by sorting them into groups that do not fall into these protected classes, antidiscrimination laws don’t apply in the United States. (Profiling techniques like those Facebook uses to help machine-learning models sort users are probably illegal under European Union data protection laws, but this has not yet been litigated.) Many people will not even know that they were profiled or discriminated against, which makes it tough to bring legal action. They no longer feel the unfairness, the injustice, firsthand—and that has historically been a precondition to launching a claim.\nIndividuals should not have to fight for their data privacy rights and be responsible for every consequence of their digital actions. Consider an analogy: people have a right to safe drinking water, but they aren’t urged to exercise that right by checking the quality of the water with a pipette every time they have a drink at the tap. Instead, regulatory agencies act on everyone’s behalf to ensure that all our water is safe. The same must be done for digital privacy: it isn’t something the average user is, or should be expected to be, personally competent to protect.\nThere are two parallel approaches that should be pursued to protect the public.\nOne is better use of class or group actions, otherwise known as collective redress actions. Historically, these have been limited in Europe, but in November 2020 the European parliament passed a measure that requires all 27 EU member states to implement measures allowing for collective redress actions across the region. Compared with the US, the EU has stronger laws protecting consumer data and promoting competition, so class or group action lawsuits in Europe can be a powerful tool for lawyers and activists to force big tech companies to change their behavior even in cases where the per-person damages would be very low.\nClass action lawsuits have most often been used in the US to seek financial damages, but they can also be used to force changes in policy and practice. They can work hand in hand with campaigns to change public opinion, especially in consumer cases (for example, by forcing Big Tobacco to admit to the link between smoking and cancer, or by paving the way for car seatbelt laws).

More mature ideas hitting the top of the product team’s funnel means better results for the business.</p><p>This challenge usually starts out with an announcement from an executive that there is now a team responsible for taking innovative ideas and converting them into new products and new ventures. Everyone in the organisation gets excited, and ideas fly in from everywhere.</p><p>The team gets overwhelmed. It’s challenging assessing every idea in detail. Some ideas are no more than a few lines in an email. Others might be live “products” that business units have lovingly invested in and developed in stealth mode to meet their own needs. Many of the ideas just aren’t mature enough to work on and require more research.</p><p>The team is forced to push back — they also have their own strategic set of ideas they’ve been tasked with progressing. They need to manage their time.</p><p>The people that submitted ideas get upset or become disengaged. The business doesn’t want to miss a good opportunity. The product team gets put under pressure to take the ideas on, so discovery work gets pushed back onto people in order to get through the volume of work.</p><p>People across the business don’t feel heard. They think their ideas are great (don’t we all think our own ideas are great?). They feel like the product or venture team isn’t doing its work. They stop wanting to collaborate.</p><p>“We gave an outstanding idea to the Lab, but they just told us our idea was no good and we had to go do more work. They then proposed they bill us for their time to work on the idea, isn’t that their job?!?” — actual quote from General Manager.</p><p>These problems — people not feeling heard, lack of team capacity for researching new ideas, the need to efficiently and effectively assess ideas at scale — can be partly solved by uplifting the Discovery skills of non-product people.</p><p>The intention here isn’t to turn everyone into a product manager. The intention is to give someone with an idea, the tools and skills needed to do a <em>good enough</em> discovery around a new idea. With extra emphasis on <em>good enough</em>, not perfect. Enough that the product team has something they can work with and assess against everything else in the pipeline and portfolio.</p><p>This is a win for everyone. The product team is able to make better use of the amazing insights people with ideas have and scale this more effectively. People with ideas know what is expected of them and why it’s expected, which means better ideas and less disappointment or frustration.</p><p>This guide to uplifting the Discovery skills of non-product people covers the knowledge that people need to have and then the skills they will need to put that knowledge into action.</p><h3>Discovery Knowledge for Non-product People</h3><p>Before someone can effectively run a Discovery for a new idea, they need some background understanding on these key concepts (ideally in order):</p><ol><li>How ideas become a reality</li><li>Why start with Discovery?</li><li>Why focus on the customer and their problem first?</li><li>How discovery usually evolves (what to expect)</li><li>Key concepts to know</li><li>How a decision will be made on whether to proceed or not</li></ol><h3>How Ideas Become a Reality</h3><p>You need to understand the context a new idea exists in so that you can better help that idea form. For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to avoid complex process diagrams with decision points and flow charts. Instead, the popular double diamond framework provides us with a simple illustration of how an idea best progresses from concept to a real, working product or venture.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tju3cwSB78mjbdus.png\" /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond\">Double Diamond</a> is a process developed by the Design Council of the UK. It combines divergent thinking (exploring an issue widely) and convergent thinking to understand the problem, use these insights to define a solution, develop a solution then deliver a solution (put it into action).</p><p>Most organisations use some variation of this to work ideas from a few lines on a piece of paper to something being used by customers and earning revenue (or results).</p><p>Most of the time a new idea will need multiple iterations around this loop. For various reasons, many organisations can struggle with iterations (e.g. fear of failure, budget or governance process).</p><p>When someone is submitting ideas to a product or venture team, they’re coming in at the Discover step. You need to help them understand the problem in order to get to the next step. Most people unfamiliar with these techniques jump straight to develop mode (“I already know what we need to do, can you just build it?”).</p><h3>Why Start with Discovery?</h3><p>You need to start with a Discovery because this is <em>the</em> process for understanding the problem and the customer. It’s a way of explicitly stating your assumptions. This is the foundation that any successful venture, product or idea is built on.</p><p>If you find yourself saying “ <a href=\"https://terem.tech/when-knowing-your-customers-best-isnt-beneficial/\">I understand the customer</a> “, “I already understand the problem” or “I already know what we need” then, I can tell you now you are wrong. This comes from hard-won, expensive experience that I’ve learnt too often. The people and companies with the best understanding of their customer always say they don’t understand their customers enough, those that lack it always says they know what their customers need.</p><p>You can find a more detailed explanation of <a href=\"https://terem.tech/why-do-product-discovery/\">why Discovery is the essential foundation for any product or venture here</a>. Including a list of the benefits, risks for skipping it and false reasons people give for why it isn’t needed.</p><h3>Why Focus on The Customer and Their Problem First?</h3><p>The reason why you focus on the customer (or citizen!) and their problem first is because, at the end of the day, this is where a product succeeds or fails. You need to solve a problem.</p><p>As a non-product person, helping your product or venture team understand the customer problem is where you can add an immense amount of value, especially because you are probably closer to the customer than they are.</p><p>The focus on this, really getting this right, is far more important in the early stages of the process than market size, solutions and, even business models. If you understand the problem well, everything else can fall into place and be designed around it. If you get it wrong, then you’ll forever be trying to make up for it, often in an unnecessarily expensive way.</p><h3>What to Expect From Discovery</h3><p>When you are doing a discovery, you will likely start with the idea that you think is amazing. Then you’ll begin to explicitly stating your assumptions and interviewing customers. You are going to start learning things about the problem, about your assumptions and your customers that you had not considered.</p><p>If you’re doing it right, you will almost certainly change direction. You’ll either completely change your thinking, or you’ll make adjustments.</p><p>Follow the problem and your research, not your biases and initial assumptions.</p><p>You’ll come to the end of your discovery activities and be faced with <a href=\"https://terem.tech/end-of-discovery-decisions-what-to-do-next/\">an end of Discovery decision</a>. You’ll need to consider this before you go ahead and take it to the group that decides whether to proceed or not (it’s usually some kind of committee or executive group, but in smaller companies, it might be an individual).</p><h3>Key Concepts to Know</h3><p>There are a few concepts to consider when working through a Discovery. The list below is a refined list selected for non-product people working through the process of getting their idea up.</p><ol><li><strong>Recognise the realities of large companies</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>New ideas carry high uncertainty that large companies aren’t used to. Be aware of this and how to deal with it, don’t get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to provide certainty where it isn’t possible.</li><li>There are corporate forces that work against new products and ventures. Be aware of them, address them head-on.</li><li>Corporations get distracted by market size. It’s not always the right way to think early on with an idea.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Understand how product development is approached beyond discovery</strong> — start with the <a href=\"https://terem.tech/principles-of-product/\">principles of a product-led approach</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Focus on customers at the start of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle</strong>: Early on, you want and need to focus on customers that will be innovators. The ones that will be ok with early versions of your product, early versions that have less features because they feel the pain strongly and are willing to take some risk. Only once you are succeeding with them will you consider expanding the product to meet the needs of later adopters.</p><h3>How a Decision to Proceed Will be Made</h3><p>Finally, you want to have some understanding of how a decision will be made about whether your idea proceeds to whatever the next step in your organisation’s process is.</p><p>Most companies will have a framework or some criteria.

More mature ideas hitting the top of the product team’s funnel means better results for the business.\nThis challenge usually starts out with an announcement from an executive that there is now a team responsible for taking innovative ideas and converting them into new products and new ventures. Everyone in the organisation gets excited, and ideas fly in from everywhere.\nThe team gets overwhelmed. It’s challenging assessing every idea in detail. Some ideas are no more than a few lines in an email. Others might be live “products” that business units have lovingly invested in and developed in stealth mode to meet their own needs. Many of the ideas just aren’t mature enough to work on and require more research.\nThe team is forced to push back — they also have their own strategic set of ideas they’ve been tasked with progressing. They need to manage their time.\nThe people that submitted ideas get upset or become disengaged. The business doesn’t want to miss a good opportunity. The product team gets put under pressure to take the ideas on, so discovery work gets pushed back onto people in order to get through the volume of work.\nPeople across the business don’t feel heard. They think their ideas are great (don’t we all think our own ideas are great?). They feel like the product or venture team isn’t doing its work. They stop wanting to collaborate.\n“We gave an outstanding idea to the Lab, but they just told us our idea was no good and we had to go do more work. They then proposed they bill us for their time to work on the idea, isn’t that their job?!?” — actual quote from General Manager.\nThese problems — people not feeling heard, lack of team capacity for researching new ideas, the need to efficiently and effectively assess ideas at scale — can be partly solved by uplifting the Discovery skills of non-product people.\nThe intention here isn’t to turn everyone into a product manager. The intention is to give someone with an idea, the tools and skills needed to do a good enough discovery around a new idea. With extra emphasis on good enough, not perfect. Enough that the product team has something they can work with and assess against everything else in the pipeline and portfolio.\nThis is a win for everyone. The product team is able to make better use of the amazing insights people with ideas have and scale this more effectively. People with ideas know what is expected of them and why it’s expected, which means better ideas and less disappointment or frustration.\nThis guide to uplifting the Discovery skills of non-product people covers the knowledge that people need to have and then the skills they will need to put that knowledge into action.\nDiscovery Knowledge for Non-product People\nBefore someone can effectively run a Discovery for a new idea, they need some background understanding on these key concepts (ideally in order):\n\nHow ideas become a reality\nWhy start with Discovery?\nWhy focus on the customer and their problem first?\nHow discovery usually evolves (what to expect)\nKey concepts to know\nHow a decision will be made on whether to proceed or not\n\nHow Ideas Become a Reality\nYou need to understand the context a new idea exists in so that you can better help that idea form. For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to avoid complex process diagrams with decision points and flow charts. Instead, the popular double diamond framework provides us with a simple illustration of how an idea best progresses from concept to a real, working product or venture.\n\nThe Double Diamond is a process developed by the Design Council of the UK. It combines divergent thinking (exploring an issue widely) and convergent thinking to understand the problem, use these insights to define a solution, develop a solution then deliver a solution (put it into action).\nMost organisations use some variation of this to work ideas from a few lines on a piece of paper to something being used by customers and earning revenue (or results).\nMost of the time a new idea will need multiple iterations around this loop. For various reasons, many organisations can struggle with iterations (e.g. fear of failure, budget or governance process).\nWhen someone is submitting ideas to a product or venture team, they’re coming in at the Discover step. You need to help them understand the problem in order to get to the next step. Most people unfamiliar with these techniques jump straight to develop mode (“I already know what we need to do, can you just build it?”).\nWhy Start with Discovery?\nYou need to start with a Discovery because this is the process for understanding the problem and the customer. It’s a way of explicitly stating your assumptions. This is the foundation that any successful venture, product or idea is built on.\nIf you find yourself saying “ I understand the customer “, “I already understand the problem” or “I already know what we need” then, I can tell you now you are wrong. This comes from hard-won, expensive experience that I’ve learnt too often. The people and companies with the best understanding of their customer always say they don’t understand their customers enough, those that lack it always says they know what their customers need.\nYou can find a more detailed explanation of why Discovery is the essential foundation for any product or venture here. Including a list of the benefits, risks for skipping it and false reasons people give for why it isn’t needed.\nWhy Focus on The Customer and Their Problem First?\nThe reason why you focus on the customer (or citizen!) and their problem first is because, at the end of the day, this is where a product succeeds or fails. You need to solve a problem.\nAs a non-product person, helping your product or venture team understand the customer problem is where you can add an immense amount of value, especially because you are probably closer to the customer than they are.\nThe focus on this, really getting this right, is far more important in the early stages of the process than market size, solutions and, even business models. If you understand the problem well, everything else can fall into place and be designed around it. If you get it wrong, then you’ll forever be trying to make up for it, often in an unnecessarily expensive way.\nWhat to Expect From Discovery\nWhen you are doing a discovery, you will likely start with the idea that you think is amazing. Then you’ll begin to explicitly stating your assumptions and interviewing customers. You are going to start learning things about the problem, about your assumptions and your customers that you had not considered.\nIf you’re doing it right, you will almost certainly change direction. You’ll either completely change your thinking, or you’ll make adjustments.\nFollow the problem and your research, not your biases and initial assumptions.\nYou’ll come to the end of your discovery activities and be faced with an end of Discovery decision. You’ll need to consider this before you go ahead and take it to the group that decides whether to proceed or not (it’s usually some kind of committee or executive group, but in smaller companies, it might be an individual).\nKey Concepts to Know\nThere are a few concepts to consider when working through a Discovery. The list below is a refined list selected for non-product people working through the process of getting their idea up.\n\nRecognise the realities of large companies:\n\nNew ideas carry high uncertainty that large companies aren’t used to. Be aware of this and how to deal with it, don’t get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to provide certainty where it isn’t possible.\nThere are corporate forces that work against new products and ventures. Be aware of them, address them head-on.\nCorporations get distracted by market size. It’s not always the right way to think early on with an idea.\n\n2. Understand how product development is approached beyond discovery — start with the principles of a product-led approach.\n3. Focus on customers at the start of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle: Early on, you want and need to focus on customers that will be innovators. The ones that will be ok with early versions of your product, early versions that have less features because they feel the pain strongly and are willing to take some risk. Only once you are succeeding with them will you consider expanding the product to meet the needs of later adopters.\nHow a Decision to Proceed Will be Made\nFinally, you want to have some understanding of how a decision will be made about whether your idea proceeds to whatever the next step in your organisation’s process is.\nMost companies will have a framework or some criteria. Get this ahead of time.\nThen make sure your pitch for proceeding focuses on why it’s worth proceeding to the next stage rather than why you need to Go-to-Market now. It’s easy to get diverted by solutions, market sizing and trends, but it’s usually so early in the evolution of the idea that the idea is easily rejected because it carries too many assumptions or risks.\nInstead, focus on what you have with your newly gained understanding of the customer and the problem. Pitch to address the assumptions you have and outline possible solutions to the problem.\nWhen it comes to the pitch itself, after we’ve debated the idea, I personally find it beneficial to focus everyone on four key questions:\n\nDo we want to be in this space?\nIs this a good enough idea in the space?\nWhat’s the single biggest assumption we need to address?\nDoes this proposed next step address this assumption?\n\nDiscovery Tools for Non-product People\nThe key tools that a non-product person needs to run a good enough Discovery are:\n\nCustomer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas\nJobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)\nBusiness Model Canvas\n\nOther tools like wireframing or prototyping tools were considered but have explicitly been omitted. These tools send people inexperienced with discovery too far down the solution path and become distractions from them focusing on the problem and the customer.\nTools for market sizing and complex financial analysis have also been explicitly omitted. These activities distract from focusing on real customer problems.\nThe tools that have been listed really focus the mind on the customer, the customer’s problem, the commercial opportunity and the viability of that opportunity.

I spent about three and a half years in gaming, launching multiple titles and leading multinational teams. I built up expertise in data analysis, economic modeling, monetization design, and live operations and optimization. I directly managed multidisciplinary teams and led projects with up to 50 developers. I left my position as a Director in 2017 when I decided to switch to more traditional software products.</p><p>I worked at Evernote for just under two years. My first year I spent working on the Growth Experimentation team as Product Lead, where I worked with my peers to learn and define what Growth meant at Evernote. We found new success with this team, expanding to three full scrum teams. I spent my next year in new product discovery, building a case and defining an MVP; this product was developed after I left and is currently in beta as of the time of this writing.</p><p>I moved to Autodesk in 2018, by way of the acquisition of PlanGrid, a construction productivity software solution. At PlanGrid / Autodesk, I managed one of our top used features across our entire construction software suite, while engaging in new product discovery for a feature that is now in beta. I applied and was promoted to Group Product Manager after a year and a half with Autodesk, after having built a case for a new product, coached and mentored several PMs, drove improvements to our hiring process, and led strategy on a large cross-organizational initiative. I now manage a team of three product managers, overseeing multiple product lines.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Becoming a Product Leader isn’t just about getting a promotion, a title change, or a new position. It’s about becoming the kind of person that can lead organizations and who other leaders want to follow. It’s a journey of many steps — from shifting your internal perspective, to taking on new and challenging initiatives, to practicing new ways of working with others. And each step on this journey will move you closer to being the kind of leader that you want to be.</p><p>When it comes to getting a title or promotion, there are no guarantees. This will not likely be a transaction in which you can negotiate, “if I do these three things, you will give me a promotion.” Instead, focus on becoming the person you want to be, and the opportunities will eventually align with your hard work and preparation.</p><p>With each article in this series, I’ll be sharing my perspective and personal experiences on the changes I made and the actions I took. I hope that the frameworks and examples help and guide you in your own journey towards becoming a Product Leader.</p><p>Next in the series, Part 1 of Becoming a Product Leader: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@James_Wang-Product/becoming-a-product-leader-part-1-thinking-like-a-leader-b38e1d4bccd7\">Thinking Like a Leader</a>.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

Shifting this perspective was fundamental to unblocking my progress.\nDriving Impact:\n\nPart 2: Driving Business Outcomes and Impact\nPart 3: Establishing Excellence in Product Management\nPart 4: Growing a Team\n\nThis section covers the kinds of impact you should strive to achieve as a growing Product Leader. It’s about growing the organization and business via taking on larger initiatives, driving improvements in product processes, and leveling up the PM team.\nCollaborative Leadership:\n\nPart 5: Influencing an Organization\n\nCollaborating with other leaders to influence and effect change across an organization is an ever evolving challenge and the cornerstone of great leadership. While individual initiatives may succeed or fail, how you worked with people along the way indicates whether you and your organization will be successful over the long run.\nAbout Me\nI wanted to mention a bit about my background to provide context for these articles.\nI got my start as a Product Manager about eight years ago, in mobile free to play gaming. I spent about three and a half years in gaming, launching multiple titles and leading multinational teams. I built up expertise in data analysis, economic modeling, monetization design, and live operations and optimization. I directly managed multidisciplinary teams and led projects with up to 50 developers. I left my position as a Director in 2017 when I decided to switch to more traditional software products.\nI worked at Evernote for just under two years. My first year I spent working on the Growth Experimentation team as Product Lead, where I worked with my peers to learn and define what Growth meant at Evernote. We found new success with this team, expanding to three full scrum teams. I spent my next year in new product discovery, building a case and defining an MVP; this product was developed after I left and is currently in beta as of the time of this writing.\nI moved to Autodesk in 2018, by way of the acquisition of PlanGrid, a construction productivity software solution. At PlanGrid / Autodesk, I managed one of our top used features across our entire construction software suite, while engaging in new product discovery for a feature that is now in beta. I applied and was promoted to Group Product Manager after a year and a half with Autodesk, after having built a case for a new product, coached and mentored several PMs, drove improvements to our hiring process, and led strategy on a large cross-organizational initiative. I now manage a team of three product managers, overseeing multiple product lines.\nSummary\nBecoming a Product Leader isn’t just about getting a promotion, a title change, or a new position. It’s about becoming the kind of person that can lead organizations and who other leaders want to follow. It’s a journey of many steps — from shifting your internal perspective, to taking on new and challenging initiatives, to practicing new ways of working with others. And each step on this journey will move you closer to being the kind of leader that you want to be.\nWhen it comes to getting a title or promotion, there are no guarantees. This will not likely be a transaction in which you can negotiate, “if I do these three things, you will give me a promotion.” Instead, focus on becoming the person you want to be, and the opportunities will eventually align with your hard work and preparation.\nWith each article in this series, I’ll be sharing my perspective and personal experiences on the changes I made and the actions I took. I hope that the frameworks and examples help and guide you in your own journey towards becoming a Product Leader.\nNext in the series, Part 1 of Becoming a Product Leader: Thinking Like a Leader.\nThanks for reading!

It was early February, and vaccine appointments were scarce, so Schaffer, who was already vaccinated herself, was volunteering her time to help friends, family, and even strangers secure their shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had read stories about people across the country stumbling upon vaccines that were about to expire: on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/us/oregon-vaccine-stuck-in-the-snow-drivers.html\">a highway in Oregon</a> during a snowstorm, or at <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@justlydeserved/video/6912929016932568325\">pharmacies</a> at the end of the day. And so when she heard about Dr. B, a new website which offered to notify people of waitlisted covid vaccines available nearby, it seemed worth a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company had a simple proposition: provide your information, and Dr. B would scour the listings of vaccine providers nearby to find extra doses that needed to be used up. If there was a match, the patient would receive a text and get 15 minutes to reserve the shot. The service asked those signing up to give their name, zip code, date of birth, email, phone number, and type of work and to flag up any medical conditions such as asthma, cancer, or pregnancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Schaffer’s contacts was a 70-something man from Brooklyn who had cancer and was eligible for vaccination but couldn’t find an appointment. “I signed up for Dr. B out of desperation,” Schaffer says: she got a message telling her the man was number 10,891 on Dr. B’s list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within weeks, that number had ballooned into the millions, thanks to coverage in the New York Times, Bloomberg, Time, and elsewhere—all emphasizing Dr. B’s promise to play matchmaker between sites with leftover doses and Americans desperate for a shot. (Today, it claims that nearly 2.5 million people have signed up for the service.) And people <em>were</em> desperate: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/30/1017086/cdc-44-million-vaccine-data-vams-problems/\">appointment websites were breaking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/01/1016725/people-are-building-their-own-vaccine-appointment-tools/\">some people were crowdsourcing their way to vaccination</a>, and headlines suggested the country was in a race between vaccines and dangerous new variants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screenshot-dr-b-covid.png?w=682\" alt=\"Text message welcoming user to Dr B service\" class=\"wp-image-1025293\" width=\"359\" height=\"312\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But for Schaffer, the whole thing was just an exercise in false hope. Dr. B did not alert her to any standby appointments, so she carried on searching manually and eventually found the man an appointment herself. It was only on April 1, weeks after he had already gotten vaccinated, that she finally heard back from the service—and even then it didn’t offer an appointment but just the possibility of one. “You have a 50% chance of receiving an alert for a dose tomorrow,” the text message read. “Are you available tomorrow to get the COVID vaccine?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By that time, though, vaccine appointments were abundant, and all New Yorkers over 30 were eligible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of the notification perplexed her, but it turns out that it was far from unusual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I searched for people who had used Dr. B to actually receive a vaccination. I made phone calls to and exchanged messages with people who had signed up. I scoured online forums and neighborhood groups across the country. But after weeks of looking, I was unable to identify a single individual who successfully got a shot through the service. Instead, I heard from dozens of people all over the country who signed up but only received notice of available vaccines long after they had already been vaccinated elsewhere, as well as many others who say they were never contacted by the company after initial registration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen Menendez, a moderator of a popular New York City Facebook group with nearly 10,000 members that acts as a hub for covid-19 information, says she’s seen discussion of Dr. B but has yet to encounter anyone who got a vaccine through the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology forged during this global health crisis—from <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/23/1016820/telemedicine-zoom-doctor-online-health-care/\">video calling</a> to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017803/digital-contact-tracing-app-covid/\">contact tracing apps</a> to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/26/1002191/how-show-a-coronavirus-vaccine-prevents-covid-19/\">vaccines themselves</a>—has faced a special set of challenges. Systems often needed to be spun up quickly, in high-visibility environments, and with lives at stake. Under such pressures, few of these technologies have succeeded completely, and many have failed to live up to expectations. Building services to help people when they are at their most vulnerable <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/17/1020811/better-tech-government-pandemic-united-states/\">is not easy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more, I asked Dr. B itself how many people it had gotten vaccinated. But after a series of verbal and written requests, and in an interview with its founder, Dr. B refused to say how many vaccines it had helped deliver, or to offer any other measure of success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was left wondering: Did Dr. B achieve what it set out to do? And what is the company doing with its huge list of people’s names, locations, contact information, and health conditions?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The “national” waitlist</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When he was touting Dr. B to the press shortly after starting the company in January 2021, founder Cyrus Massoumi explained what inspired him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I had this idea, reading all the articles,” Massoumi, a serial entrepreneur, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/algorithms-match-vaccine-seekers-with-soon-to-be-wasted-doses\">told Bloomberg in March</a>. “Why is there not a nationwide standby system that any provider could use that would effectively reallocate the vaccine?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. B was his answer to that question. The service doesn’t provide vaccines itself; instead, it relies on partnerships with official vaccination sites, which then notify it when they expect to have leftover doses. The company says it uses an algorithm to comb through its list of eligible nearby users and give them the option of reserving a dose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brittany Marsh, the owner and pharmacist of Cornerstone Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first provider to sign on to work with Dr. B. She was introduced to the company through a mutual friend who knew Chelsea Clinton, a friend of Massoumi’s, she says. Company representatives flew to Arkansas to test the service and had it up and running “in record timing,” Marsh says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were making calls and trying to get people in the door to save the shots in arms before they expired,” she says. Though the pharmacy wasn’t wasting any doses at the time, “it definitely made our life easier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In interviews given by Massoumi at the time, he talked about building a national network of providers. But when the company went on its publicity blitz in March, Marsh’s pharmacy was just one of two vaccination sites in the entire country that the company had agreements with. (The other was a vaccine hub in <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/want-join-vaccine-standby-list-national-signup-just-launched-queens\">Queens, New York</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users were encouraged to sign up wherever they lived, but Dr. B did not tell them whether it had partnerships with vaccinators in their state or zip code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The company has continued to promote the idea of a nationwide service, with online posts claiming the service “is available in all 50 states.” When asked exactly how large its network is, Massoumi told MIT Technology Review that Dr. B does not have nationwide coverage but has around 600 vaccination partners across 37 states—although the company declined to say who they are, or which states it is active in. And those partnerships do not include national-level agreements with major chains such as CVS or Walgreens, which both said they were not working with Dr. B at a corporate level, though Massoumi says some individual stores are Dr. B providers. Six hundred partners may seem extensive, but it accounts for less than 1% of the more than 80,000 US vaccination sites tracked by the CDC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. B’s limited presence may come as a surprise, given its founder’s experience in digital health services. Massoumi previously cofounded Zocdoc, a popular online appointment search and booking site, and served as its CEO. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/zocdoc-health-tech-startup-lawsuit-new-york-5c151b39-d9ea-449f-b0fd-3e6933b3261d.html\">He left Zocdoc in 2015</a> and went on to start Shadow, an app that helps reunite lost pets with their owners. While Dr. B—which Massoumi says he is funding himself—does not charge either users or partners for its services, it now has <a href=\"https://www.mmm-online.com/home/podcasts/the-mmm-podcast-4-16-21-dr-bs-cyrus-massoumi/\">at least 56 employees</a>, including a team of 30 organizers, most with a background in politics. In February it expanded even further, <a href=\"https://vaxstandby.com/about\">acquiring another waitlisting service</a>, Vax Standby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this heavy investment, however, Dr. B’s footprint is apparently so small that Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, which represents and coordinates state vaccine campaigns across the entire country, says she was not even aware of Dr. B until she was interviewed for this story. In fact, says Hannan, the entire idea of a digitized waitlisting service is one that overwhelmed vaccination sites would have found hard to adopt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Getting providers to use a new reporting system or a new scheduling system, a new IT interface—that’s much more of a challenge than getting them to agree to accept and give the vaccine,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Private data vs. public health</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. B is one of many private efforts that we’ve seen emerge to fill the gaps in America’s health system, from the private covid-19 testing sites that have overtaken strip malls to health-care tech companies entrusted to schedule <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/12/1018092/vaccine-signup-chicago-zocdoc-frustrating-as-tech-companies-step-in-deeper-inequalities-harder-to-fix/\">vaccine appointments</a>. With all these developments, it’s become harder for consumers and patients to differentiate between public pandemic response and for-profit entities. Crowdsourced resource lists regularly mention Dr. B’s waitlist signup, for example, alongside official public health websites, the federally operated Vaccines.gov, notices from health-care providers, and other medical services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But public health departments and private companies have different reasons for existing, even if the stated missions sound similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The incentives are the opposite,” says Elizabeth Renieris, a tech and human rights fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center. “Public health and public interest concerns traditionally are not driven by profit or growth, or speed or efficiency, or any of those values.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The famous saying in business is, if you’re not paying, you’re the product,” says Kayte Spector-Bagdady, associate director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine at the University of Michigan. “Weight tracker apps will help you track your weight, or fertility applications will help track your cycle. But the business model is really being able to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health-privacy/what-your-period-tracker-app-knows-about-you/\">sell that data</a> out the back end.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rules in place under HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, intended to stop oversharing of health data. But if a company is not one of the “covered entities,” then the rules don’t apply, and there is a well-established business model for private health companies that relies on collecting consumer health data and selling it or sharing it with third parties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The vast majority of these private-sector companies providing these tools are not going to be HIPAA-covered entities,” Renieris says. “It’s this displacement of the public interest by the private sector.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Dr. B itself does not provide care, it is one of those entities not covered by HIPAA, and the data it collects falls outside the law’s protections. That means when people sign up for Dr. B’s services, their health information is not protected by HIPAA, but by whatever is outlined in the site’s privacy policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FAQ section of Dr. B’s website says that thanks to its staff’s “decades” of experience dealing with HIPAA, it voluntarily adheres to those standards when storing and sharing user data, including encrypting the information. And its privacy policy does lay out some comprehensive-sounding protections. The website <a href=\"https://hidrb.com/faq\">says</a> it does not sell information that would identify people, and only shares users’ personal information with providers once they’ve opted in to receive a vaccine nearby. It also gives users the option to request that their personal data be deleted by sending a sequence of text messages to the service (although that fact is found halfway down the privacy policy page, and couched in legalese).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the policy also gives Dr. B the right to use personal data internally for purposes other than vaccinations and, if the company gets bought, to transfer the data to the new owner. The company declined to say what happens to information from users who opt out of vaccine notifications, and its policy is equally silent on the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such collected information can be lucrative. The zip code you live in and whether you have asthma can be valuable for advertisers marketing treatments; private or industry-sponsored researchers looking to recruit study participants might want a list of people with autoimmune disorders. And though many Americans are used to giving up data in the age of invasive tracking by tech giants, Spector-Bagdady says health data is different from, say, information on what kinds of clothes you like to wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are only so many pairs of mom jeans that I can purchase, but if you have health data from millions of people who have insurance, to whom you can advertise and target very expensive drugs that the insurance will cover, then you’re into some really profitable areas in terms of drug development, drug marketing, algorithmic and machine-learning developments,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Dr. B users I spoke to said that they expect information about themselves to be shared among private companies. But others said they were so desperate to protect themselves and loved ones that they didn’t even consider what information they were handing over when they signed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renieris says it’s hard enough in normal times to ask people to investigate every digital interaction to make sure they know what they’re signing up for and who they’re giving their data to. Add in the fear and urgency of a pandemic and it’s even more of a burden on the consumer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You begin to sign up for anything at that stage,” says Menendez, the Facebook group administrator. “I think that logic kind of goes out of the window.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Going straight to the source</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Without any evidence that Dr. B was successfully rerouting leftover doses, I still had questions, so I contacted the company to organize a conversation with its founder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 17, I interviewed Massoumi over Google Meet. He was accompanied by his communications team, including at least one representative from a public relations firm specializing in crisis communications. During the course of our conversation, Massoumi talked about learning from Dr. B’s “highly scalable” system and said that the company had a commitment to equitable distribution of vaccines, but he refused to say how many patients had been vaccinated through Dr. B.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the company was happy to publish the number of signups it had on its website, he claimed that revealing vaccination numbers would violate user privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Massoumi said Dr. B is committed to data privacy, reiterating the company’s claim that its staff’s previous experience with HIPAA means it understands how to protect user data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Just because we’re not a covered entity under HIPAA doesn’t mean that we can’t hold our service providers to high standards of patient privacy,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has already navigated the transfer of user data on at least one occasion. When Vax Standby, the competing covid-19 vaccine waitlist, announced it was ceasing operations and merging with Dr. B, Vax Standby’s founders publicly promised to keep user data separate and not to automatically place its subscribers on Dr. B’s waitlist. Massoumi said he respected Vax Standby’s move, but that it wasn’t ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t think that was in the public health interest,” he said. “I think many of those people could have benefited from the platform that we built.” (He added that Vax Standby user data was eventually deleted without being transferred.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Dr. B users had told me that data sharing was an issue for them only in hindsight. They said how panicked they had become as vaccination slots seemed nonexistent, and how little attention they paid to the personal information they were handing over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I appreciate the fact that if perhaps an evil person was running this company, that they could do a lot of evil things in the world,” Massoumi said. “I assure you, that’s not my reason for doing this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Massoumi more questions about how desperation may have driven people to sign up for services without scrutinizing them. But he began discussing a different topic instead: the number of Americans who do not have health insurance. When pressed, Massoumi ended the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t have time to get into it with you,” he said before leaving the call.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“A bizarre attempt”</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After our interview, I sent a list of 20 questions to Dr. B representatives to request more information. My queries revolved around the company’s basic business model, its activities, and its privacy policies—and included a request for key details that Massoumi had earlier said he would provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building new technologies is a hard job that has been dramatically complicated by the pandemic, but these were typical questions about its operations that any startup might expect. We asked how many vaccine notifications the company had sent out; how many people had received a vaccine through the service; and whether it had consulted with health-care providers about the service’s usefulness. We also asked what the business model for this free service was, and whether it would seek outside funding in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. B refused to share even basic information about its operations. Instead, the company sent back the following statement, claiming that our inquiries were a “bizarre attempt” to question Dr. B’s attempts to get people vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Dr. B was created during the height of the covid-19 crisis with the clear mission to save lives by rapidly getting vaccines into as many arms as possible because too many vaccines go to waste,” it said. “This important effort reflects the need to make vaccine distribution efficient and equitable and meet the urgent needs of underserved communities to help bring the pandemic to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are proud to have helped nearly 2.5 million people sign up for notifications about immediately available vaccines through hundreds of providers nationwide. So we are entirely flummoxed by this bizarre attempt to treat such a civic-minded endeavor as anything other than a genuine and committed effort to remove barriers that prevent people from getting vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“From day one we understood the importance of protecting users’ data and that is why we have developed robust policies and practices to keep their information private and secure. Our privacy policy makes it clear that user data is never rented, sold or shared with any third party inappropriately. As a completely opt-in service, users have the ability to permanently delete their data from Dr. B at any time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Solving a temporary problem?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that Dr. B tapped into a very real issue when it launched: at the time, finding an available appointment was impossible for <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/03/1017245/broadband-digital-divide-senior-citizens-pandemic/\">all but the most internet savvy or well-connected</a>. With so many people struggling to get a vaccine, even whispers of <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/it-wasnt-hoax-what-really-happened-brooklyn-army-terminal-vaccination-site\">leftover doses</a> that might be trashed were enough to cause anger and confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manual and digital systems started to proliferate to address the issue: pharmacies set up their own paper waitlists, and alongside Dr. B and Vax Standby, there were digital services like VaccinateCA, a crowdsourced effort to spot open slots in California, and TurboVax, a viral Twitter bot that shared available appointments online as they dropped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, stories of leftover—or, worse, wasted—vaccines were a particularly painful and visible example of health systems failing. But as vaccine supplies expanded, that moment quickly passed. Hannan, of the Association of Immunization Managers, says waste has actually been minimal compared with what’s accepted in other mass vaccination initiatives. The federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides kids with shots regardless of their family’s ability to pay, has an expected wastage rate of 5%, she says. <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/cvs-and-walgreens-have-wasted-more-vaccine-doses-than-most-states-combined/\">Data about covid vaccines obtained</a> by Kaiser Health News, meanwhile, show that the CDC recorded 182,874 covid vaccines thrown out in the first three months vaccinations were available—just 0.1% of the more than 147.6 million doses administered as of March 30. According to CDC data, 70% of recorded covid-19 vaccine wastage happened at CVS and Walgreens—both companies that confirmed they have no national-level partnerships with Dr. B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As vaccines have grown easier to access, some broker services have shuttered. Cities like Philadelphia are <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly-tips/covid-vaccine-list-removal-philadelphia-suburbs-20210420.html\">asking residents</a> to take themselves off local lists, and TurboVax, the Twitter bot, announced on May 11 that it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/turbovax/status/1392089130599862280\">winding down</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The willingness of people to help strangers find vaccines—like Joanie Schaffer, the volunteer who tried using Dr. B to help people in New York, and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/21/1023212/epicenter-is-a-vaccine-matchmaker-in-new-york-city/\">other community</a> efforts—has been a small sliver of hope in an otherwise terrible year. And those who have benefited from such kindness have made their gratitude known. When TurboVax creator Huge Ma <a href=\"https://twitter.com/turbovax/status/1392089130599862280\">said</a> he was closing the service, he was overwhelmed by thousands of tweets, retweets, and responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thank you for everything you did for the community,” said one follower. “Thank you for helping my wife and me get our first shots!” wrote another. (Indeed, TurboVax followers showed their appreciation by raising more than $200,000 for small businesses in New York’s Chinatown when Ma asked for help amid rising anti-Asian violence.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drbisin\">Dr. B’s feed</a> for similar expressions of thanks from grateful, vaccinated users, and found none. But unlike its peers, the company has no plans to shut down even though the appointment crunch has largely passed. Instead, Massoumi and the company say they are looking to what comes next. He says maybe they’ll collaborate with mobile vaccination clinics, or focus on booster shots. And now that the vaccination chaos has largely passed in the US? He wants to take Dr. B overseas. After all, he told me during our interview, the US effort has come so far. “We’ve touched millions of people,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/covid-pandemic-tech\">Pandemic Technology Project</a>, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.</em></p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"When Joanie Schaffer heard about Dr. B, a free covid-19 vaccine standby service, she was running out of options.

The service asked those signing up to give their name, zip code, date of birth, email, phone number, and type of work and to flag up any medical conditions such as asthma, cancer, or pregnancy.\nOne of Schaffer’s contacts was a 70-something man from Brooklyn who had cancer and was eligible for vaccination but couldn’t find an appointment. “I signed up for Dr. B out of desperation,” Schaffer says: she got a message telling her the man was number 10,891 on Dr. B’s list. \nWithin weeks, that number had ballooned into the millions, thanks to coverage in the New York Times, Bloomberg, Time, and elsewhere—all emphasizing Dr. B’s promise to play matchmaker between sites with leftover doses and Americans desperate for a shot. (Today, it claims that nearly 2.5 million people have signed up for the service.) And people were desperate: appointment websites were breaking, some people were crowdsourcing their way to vaccination, and headlines suggested the country was in a race between vaccines and dangerous new variants. \n\nBut for Schaffer, the whole thing was just an exercise in false hope. Dr. B did not alert her to any standby appointments, so she carried on searching manually and eventually found the man an appointment herself. It was only on April 1, weeks after he had already gotten vaccinated, that she finally heard back from the service—and even then it didn’t offer an appointment but just the possibility of one. “You have a 50% chance of receiving an alert for a dose tomorrow,” the text message read. “Are you available tomorrow to get the COVID vaccine?”\nBy that time, though, vaccine appointments were abundant, and all New Yorkers over 30 were eligible. \nThe timing of the notification perplexed her, but it turns out that it was far from unusual. \nI searched for people who had used Dr. B to actually receive a vaccination. I made phone calls to and exchanged messages with people who had signed up. I scoured online forums and neighborhood groups across the country. But after weeks of looking, I was unable to identify a single individual who successfully got a shot through the service. Instead, I heard from dozens of people all over the country who signed up but only received notice of available vaccines long after they had already been vaccinated elsewhere, as well as many others who say they were never contacted by the company after initial registration. \nKaren Menendez, a moderator of a popular New York City Facebook group with nearly 10,000 members that acts as a hub for covid-19 information, says she’s seen discussion of Dr. B but has yet to encounter anyone who got a vaccine through the company.\nThe technology forged during this global health crisis—from video calling to contact tracing apps to vaccines themselves—has faced a special set of challenges. Systems often needed to be spun up quickly, in high-visibility environments, and with lives at stake. Under such pressures, few of these technologies have succeeded completely, and many have failed to live up to expectations. Building services to help people when they are at their most vulnerable is not easy. \nTo find out more, I asked Dr. B itself how many people it had gotten vaccinated. But after a series of verbal and written requests, and in an interview with its founder, Dr. B refused to say how many vaccines it had helped deliver, or to offer any other measure of success. \nSo I was left wondering: Did Dr. B achieve what it set out to do? And what is the company doing with its huge list of people’s names, locations, contact information, and health conditions?\nThe “national” waitlist\nWhen he was touting Dr. B to the press shortly after starting the company in January 2021, founder Cyrus Massoumi explained what inspired him.\n“I had this idea, reading all the articles,” Massoumi, a serial entrepreneur, told Bloomberg in March. “Why is there not a nationwide standby system that any provider could use that would effectively reallocate the vaccine?”\nDr. B was his answer to that question. The service doesn’t provide vaccines itself; instead, it relies on partnerships with official vaccination sites, which then notify it when they expect to have leftover doses. The company says it uses an algorithm to comb through its list of eligible nearby users and give them the option of reserving a dose. \nBrittany Marsh, the owner and pharmacist of Cornerstone Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first provider to sign on to work with Dr. B. She was introduced to the company through a mutual friend who knew Chelsea Clinton, a friend of Massoumi’s, she says. Company representatives flew to Arkansas to test the service and had it up and running “in record timing,” Marsh says.\n“We were making calls and trying to get people in the door to save the shots in arms before they expired,” she says. Though the pharmacy wasn’t wasting any doses at the time, “it definitely made our life easier.”\nIn interviews given by Massoumi at the time, he talked about building a national network of providers. But when the company went on its publicity blitz in March, Marsh’s pharmacy was just one of two vaccination sites in the entire country that the company had agreements with. (The other was a vaccine hub in Queens, New York.) \nUsers were encouraged to sign up wherever they lived, but Dr. B did not tell them whether it had partnerships with vaccinators in their state or zip code. \nThe company has continued to promote the idea of a nationwide service, with online posts claiming the service “is available in all 50 states.” When asked exactly how large its network is, Massoumi told MIT Technology Review that Dr. B does not have nationwide coverage but has around 600 vaccination partners across 37 states—although the company declined to say who they are, or which states it is active in. And those partnerships do not include national-level agreements with major chains such as CVS or Walgreens, which both said they were not working with Dr. B at a corporate level, though Massoumi says some individual stores are Dr. B providers. Six hundred partners may seem extensive, but it accounts for less than 1% of the more than 80,000 US vaccination sites tracked by the CDC. \nDr. B’s limited presence may come as a surprise, given its founder’s experience in digital health services. Massoumi previously cofounded Zocdoc, a popular online appointment search and booking site, and served as its CEO. He left Zocdoc in 2015 and went on to start Shadow, an app that helps reunite lost pets with their owners. While Dr. B—which Massoumi says he is funding himself—does not charge either users or partners for its services, it now has at least 56 employees, including a team of 30 organizers, most with a background in politics. In February it expanded even further, acquiring another waitlisting service, Vax Standby.\nDespite this heavy investment, however, Dr. B’s footprint is apparently so small that Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, which represents and coordinates state vaccine campaigns across the entire country, says she was not even aware of Dr. B until she was interviewed for this story. In fact, says Hannan, the entire idea of a digitized waitlisting service is one that overwhelmed vaccination sites would have found hard to adopt.\n“Getting providers to use a new reporting system or a new scheduling system, a new IT interface—that’s much more of a challenge than getting them to agree to accept and give the vaccine,” she says.\nPrivate data vs. public health\nDr. B is one of many private efforts that we’ve seen emerge to fill the gaps in America’s health system, from the private covid-19 testing sites that have overtaken strip malls to health-care tech companies entrusted to schedule vaccine appointments. With all these developments, it’s become harder for consumers and patients to differentiate between public pandemic response and for-profit entities. Crowdsourced resource lists regularly mention Dr. B’s waitlist signup, for example, alongside official public health websites, the federally operated Vaccines.gov, notices from health-care providers, and other medical services.\nBut public health departments and private companies have different reasons for existing, even if the stated missions sound similar.\n“The incentives are the opposite,” says Elizabeth Renieris, a tech and human rights fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center. “Public health and public interest concerns traditionally are not driven by profit or growth, or speed or efficiency, or any of those values.”\n“The famous saying in business is, if you’re not paying, you’re the product,” says Kayte Spector-Bagdady, associate director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine at the University of Michigan. “Weight tracker apps will help you track your weight, or fertility applications will help track your cycle. But the business model is really being able to sell that data out the back end.”\nThere are rules in place under HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, intended to stop oversharing of health data. But if a company is not one of the “covered entities,” then the rules don’t apply, and there is a well-established business model for private health companies that relies on collecting consumer health data and selling it or sharing it with third parties. \n“The vast majority of these private-sector companies providing these tools are not going to be HIPAA-covered entities,” Renieris says. “It’s this displacement of the public interest by the private sector.”\nBecause Dr. B itself does not provide care, it is one of those entities not covered by HIPAA, and the data it collects falls outside the law’s protections. That means when people sign up for Dr. B’s services, their health information is not protected by HIPAA, but by whatever is outlined in the site’s privacy policy.\nThe FAQ section of Dr. B’s website says that thanks to its staff’s “decades” of experience dealing with HIPAA, it voluntarily adheres to those standards when storing and sharing user data, including encrypting the information. And its privacy policy does lay out some comprehensive-sounding protections. The website says it does not sell information that would identify people, and only shares users’ personal information with providers once they’ve opted in to receive a vaccine nearby. It also gives users the option to request that their personal data be deleted by sending a sequence of text messages to the service (although that fact is found halfway down the privacy policy page, and couched in legalese). \nBut the policy also gives Dr. B the right to use personal data internally for purposes other than vaccinations and, if the company gets bought, to transfer the data to the new owner. The company declined to say what happens to information from users who opt out of vaccine notifications, and its policy is equally silent on the issue.\nSuch collected information can be lucrative. The zip code you live in and whether you have asthma can be valuable for advertisers marketing treatments; private or industry-sponsored researchers looking to recruit study participants might want a list of people with autoimmune disorders. And though many Americans are used to giving up data in the age of invasive tracking by tech giants, Spector-Bagdady says health data is different from, say, information on what kinds of clothes you like to wear.\n“There are only so many pairs of mom jeans that I can purchase, but if you have health data from millions of people who have insurance, to whom you can advertise and target very expensive drugs that the insurance will cover, then you’re into some really profitable areas in terms of drug development, drug marketing, algorithmic and machine-learning developments,” she says.\nSome Dr. B users I spoke to said that they expect information about themselves to be shared among private companies. But others said they were so desperate to protect themselves and loved ones that they didn’t even consider what information they were handing over when they signed up.\nRenieris says it’s hard enough in normal times to ask people to investigate every digital interaction to make sure they know what they’re signing up for and who they’re giving their data to. Add in the fear and urgency of a pandemic and it’s even more of a burden on the consumer. \n“You begin to sign up for anything at that stage,” says Menendez, the Facebook group administrator. “I think that logic kind of goes out of the window.”\nGoing straight to the source\nWithout any evidence that Dr. B was successfully rerouting leftover doses, I still had questions, so I contacted the company to organize a conversation with its founder. \nOn May 17, I interviewed Massoumi over Google Meet. He was accompanied by his communications team, including at least one representative from a public relations firm specializing in crisis communications. During the course of our conversation, Massoumi talked about learning from Dr. B’s “highly scalable” system and said that the company had a commitment to equitable distribution of vaccines, but he refused to say how many patients had been vaccinated through Dr. B. \nWhile the company was happy to publish the number of signups it had on its website, he claimed that revealing vaccination numbers would violate user privacy.\nMassoumi said Dr. B is committed to data privacy, reiterating the company’s claim that its staff’s previous experience with HIPAA means it understands how to protect user data. \n“Just because we’re not a covered entity under HIPAA doesn’t mean that we can’t hold our service providers to high standards of patient privacy,” he said. \nThe company has already navigated the transfer of user data on at least one occasion. When Vax Standby, the competing covid-19 vaccine waitlist, announced it was ceasing operations and merging with Dr. B, Vax Standby’s founders publicly promised to keep user data separate and not to automatically place its subscribers on Dr. B’s waitlist. Massoumi said he respected Vax Standby’s move, but that it wasn’t ideal.\n“I don’t think that was in the public health interest,” he said. “I think many of those people could have benefited from the platform that we built.” (He added that Vax Standby user data was eventually deleted without being transferred.)\nSome Dr. B users had told me that data sharing was an issue for them only in hindsight. They said how panicked they had become as vaccination slots seemed nonexistent, and how little attention they paid to the personal information they were handing over. \n“I appreciate the fact that if perhaps an evil person was running this company, that they could do a lot of evil things in the world,” Massoumi said. “I assure you, that’s not my reason for doing this.”\nI asked Massoumi more questions about how desperation may have driven people to sign up for services without scrutinizing them. But he began discussing a different topic instead: the number of Americans who do not have health insurance. When pressed, Massoumi ended the conversation.\n“I don’t have time to get into it with you,” he said before leaving the call.\n“A bizarre attempt”\nAfter our interview, I sent a list of 20 questions to Dr. B representatives to request more information. My queries revolved around the company’s basic business model, its activities, and its privacy policies—and included a request for key details that Massoumi had earlier said he would provide. \nBuilding new technologies is a hard job that has been dramatically complicated by the pandemic, but these were typical questions about its operations that any startup might expect. We asked how many vaccine notifications the company had sent out; how many people had received a vaccine through the service; and whether it had consulted with health-care providers about the service’s usefulness. We also asked what the business model for this free service was, and whether it would seek outside funding in the future.\nDr. B refused to share even basic information about its operations. Instead, the company sent back the following statement, claiming that our inquiries were a “bizarre attempt” to question Dr. B’s attempts to get people vaccinated. \n“Dr. B was created during the height of the covid-19 crisis with the clear mission to save lives by rapidly getting vaccines into as many arms as possible because too many vaccines go to waste,” it said. “This important effort reflects the need to make vaccine distribution efficient and equitable and meet the urgent needs of underserved communities to help bring the pandemic to an end. \n“We are proud to have helped nearly 2.5 million people sign up for notifications about immediately available vaccines through hundreds of providers nationwide. So we are entirely flummoxed by this bizarre attempt to treat such a civic-minded endeavor as anything other than a genuine and committed effort to remove barriers that prevent people from getting vaccinated.\n“From day one we understood the importance of protecting users’ data and that is why we have developed robust policies and practices to keep their information private and secure. Our privacy policy makes it clear that user data is never rented, sold or shared with any third party inappropriately. As a completely opt-in service, users have the ability to permanently delete their data from Dr. B at any time.”\nSolving a temporary problem?\nThere is no doubt that Dr. B tapped into a very real issue when it launched: at the time, finding an available appointment was impossible for all but the most internet savvy or well-connected. With so many people struggling to get a vaccine, even whispers of leftover doses that might be trashed were enough to cause anger and confusion.\nManual and digital systems started to proliferate to address the issue: pharmacies set up their own paper waitlists, and alongside Dr. B and Vax Standby, there were digital services like VaccinateCA, a crowdsourced effort to spot open slots in California, and TurboVax, a viral Twitter bot that shared available appointments online as they dropped.\nFor many people, stories of leftover—or, worse, wasted—vaccines were a particularly painful and visible example of health systems failing. But as vaccine supplies expanded, that moment quickly passed. Hannan, of the Association of Immunization Managers, says waste has actually been minimal compared with what’s accepted in other mass vaccination initiatives. The federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides kids with shots regardless of their family’s ability to pay, has an expected wastage rate of 5%, she says. Data about covid vaccines obtained by Kaiser Health News, meanwhile, show that the CDC recorded 182,874 covid vaccines thrown out in the first three months vaccinations were available—just 0.1% of the more than 147.6 million doses administered as of March 30. According to CDC data, 70% of recorded covid-19 vaccine wastage happened at CVS and Walgreens—both companies that confirmed they have no national-level partnerships with Dr. B.\nAs vaccines have grown easier to access, some broker services have shuttered. Cities like Philadelphia are asking residents to take themselves off local lists, and TurboVax, the Twitter bot, announced on May 11 that it was winding down.\nThe willingness of people to help strangers find vaccines—like Joanie Schaffer, the volunteer who tried using Dr. B to help people in New York, and other community efforts—has been a small sliver of hope in an otherwise terrible year. And those who have benefited from such kindness have made their gratitude known. When TurboVax creator Huge Ma said he was closing the service, he was overwhelmed by thousands of tweets, retweets, and responses.\n“Thank you for everything you did for the community,” said one follower. “Thank you for helping my wife and me get our first shots!” wrote another. (Indeed, TurboVax followers showed their appreciation by raising more than $200,000 for small businesses in New York’s Chinatown when Ma asked for help amid rising anti-Asian violence.) \nI looked through Dr. B’s feed for similar expressions of thanks from grateful, vaccinated users, and found none. But unlike its peers, the company has no plans to shut down even though the appointment crunch has largely passed. Instead, Massoumi and the company say they are looking to what comes next. He says maybe they’ll collaborate with mobile vaccination clinics, or focus on booster shots. And now that the vaccination chaos has largely passed in the US? He wants to take Dr. B overseas. After all, he told me during our interview, the US effort has come so far. “We’ve touched millions of people,” he said.\nThis story is part of the Pandemic Technology Project, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.","dc:creator":"Mia Sato","content":"When Joanie Schaffer heard about Dr. B, a free covid-19 vaccine standby service, she was running out of options.

Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. Hence, we employ empiricism—based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—in a continuous feedback loop that allows us to defer an investment decision to the last economically feasible moment in time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite all this mitigation effort, any Sprint Goal remains a hypothesis until we release the resulting Increment into the hands of our customers. The release is the moment of truth, and occasional failure is inevitable—even for the best Scrum Teams. Therefore, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>What Happens If There Is no Failure Culture</h2> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. If resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-failure-culture-making-your-scrum-work-10/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Scrum Failure Culture — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture. In a complex environment, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.

Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. Hence, we employ empiricism—based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—in a continuous feedback loop that allows us to defer an investment decision to the last economically feasible moment in time. \n\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all this mitigation effort, any Sprint Goal remains a hypothesis until we release the resulting Increment into the hands of our customers. The release is the moment of truth, and occasional failure is inevitable—even for the best Scrum Teams. Therefore, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.\n \r\n\r\nWhat Happens If There Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. If resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nScrum Failure Culture — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nAny organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture. In a complex environment, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure. In my eyes, failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case.

Also, we point at how sociotechnical architecture and systems thinking are key to enabling product thinking in organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then share an eight-step strategy workshop; we understand why ‘going deep’ is Stripe’s core product principle, and we wonder why some product managers hold on to timeline-based planning while product roadmaps have evolved so rapidly in recent years. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we analyze the idea of ‘autonomy’ in the workplace, particularly regarding two challenges: the air sandwich and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #293: Success Metrics, Maker-User-Gap, Strategy and Outcomes, Stakeholder Map Templates — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65970\" data-wp-pid=\"65970\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics-825x413.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics-800x400.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65968\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-292-bottom-agile/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #292: The Bottom of Agile, Efficiency is the Enemy, Nijute to Solve Impossible Problems, The Velocity Forecasting Spreadsheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #292</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Scrum of Scrum, in contrast to the others, he correctly explains it as an approach rather than a framework.</p><p>In this article, I would like to clarify why LeSS shouldn’t be seen as a scaling framework and why it can’t be compared to other scaling frameworks like those mentioned above.</p><h3>How is LeSS different from common scaling frameworks?</h3><p>Scaling frameworks, like SAFe or Scrum@Scale, guide organizations in applying concepts from Scrum, Lean, DevOps, or Design Thinking when working with multiple teams on one product. As correctly pointed out by Willem-Jan in his article, these frameworks introduce additional complexity to an already complex environment. LeSS has a fundamentally different approach. Instead of adding complexity, it aims to remove it, while still considering the organizational context around the Scrum Team.</p><p>Most scaling frameworks, like SAFe or Scrum@Scale, answer the question “How can we apply agile at scale in our big complex organization?” or like Bas Vodde (creator LeSS) once said, “How can we do what the organization already does in an agile way?’”.</p><p>Craig (Larmann — the other creator of LeSS) and Bas believe that traditional large groups are complicated not out of a real necessity, but because their organizational designs create an <em>illusion </em>that complex problems require complex solutions. They created LeSS to encourage organizations to answer another question instead: “How can we simplify an unnecessarily big and complex organization to <em>be</em> agile rather than to <em>do</em> agile?”. Precisely because LeSS promotes combatting complexity by reducing it, LeSS can be seen as a <em>descaling</em> framework rather than a scaling framework.</p><p>Like Scrum, LeSS is a lightweight framework for building products in complex environments. It provides a minimal set of rules that defines an organizational design aimed to maximize customer focus and lowering the cost of change (adaptability).</p><h3>Why not just Scrum? Why do you need something else?</h3><p>That’s right. Ideally, you don’t!</p><p>One of the most significant pieces of advice from the creators of Large-Scale Scrum is <strong>not to scale</strong>. The preferred setup of LeSS is <strong>one-team LeSS, which is Scrum</strong>. By now, fortunately, people understand that building products in complex environments is knowledge work, and you can’t fulfill twice as many requirements or cut the development effort in half by adding twice as many developers. However, there are still situations where products can’t be built by just one team. Contrary to popular belief, this is not necessary but often attempted all the same. Building a self-driving car including software and hardware could be a good example where it might be necessary that several hundred people band together. <br>As Willem-Jan mentioned in his article, Scrum provides a solution for that:</p><blockquote>“If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.” — Scrum Guide 2020</blockquote><p>While one might argue that this is enough guidance to do Scrum with multiple teams, it leaves many things open to interpretation (or experimentation). Are we doing one Sprint Review for all Scrum Teams or each Scrum Team individually? How about the Sprint Retrospectives, a pivotal part of enabling empirical process control? Is it better to have a Retrospective with all teams, or could each Scrum Team do their own separately? Here, LeSS provides guidance by offering strict rules: One Sprint Review for all Teams, Team Retrospectives, and an Overall Retrospective with team representatives from the different teams.</p><p>But besides mere process questions, there is an even more critical reason why Scrum alone will most likely not prosper in a large organization. Unless you are dealing with a 7–9 people startup, <em>there is usually an organizational context around cross-functional, self-managing teams, and this context has complexity built-in.</em> There are policies and structures like hiring, salaries, skills development, and team composition. All of these factors impact the culture and the way the team(s) work together.</p><p><em>Not understanding these effects can have a substantial negative impact on maximizing the value created by the product group, in complex environments.</em></p><p>In other words, introducing Scrum without taking environmental effects on the team(s) into account is just as ineffective as having a manager command a team to self-organize while <em>not</em> providing an enabling structure.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oE6iTkmDs4wgo2zoaTTapw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@martinirc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">José Martín Ramírez Carrasco</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/collections/10510639/management-and-organizations?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>But here comes the most problematic part.

As the citadel of tech-driven small businesses and startups, India has already come to the forefront in turning mobile apps into its footprints. The Mobile <a href=\"https://www.indianappdevelopers.com/\">app development India</a> is now primarily engaged in shaping the mobile presence for small businesses and startups. When focusing on the Indian market, even the global tech giants prioritize the wants and preferences of small and medium enterprises across the niches.</p><p>As per the statistics published by <a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2020-infographic/\">AppAnnie</a>, as of 2019, India stood globally in the 4th position among the countries with the highest concentration of Android users. There can hardly be any doubt that a considerable portion of these Android users and apps belong to small business apps. Other statistics confirm this. According to Cisco, <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/moneyball-ciscos-pankaj-mitra-on-what-startups-bring-to-the-table-for-big-tech/\">30% of the business it gets in India comes from SMEs</a>. Big brands like Google, Microsoft and Amazon continue to focus on the Indian small enterprise market with unperturbed zeal. According to the latest data, more than <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/google-survey-says-close-to-two-thirds-of-smes-in-india-are-undergoing-revenue-loss/articleshow/76733530.cms?from=mdr\">26 million</a> small businesses in India have shaped their online presence by using various Google apps, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, etc.</p><p>What makes small enterprises in India consider mobile apps so crucial for their businesses? Well, the reasons are too many. Mobile apps, apart from allowing exceptional ease of operation, can help a business do growth hacking. From robust mobile branding to delivering customer service, mobile apps play a crucial role for small businesses in some ways.</p><p>Let us have a quick look at some of the key ways mobile apps can benefit small businesses.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*6mTgKnENRXbY-BvWPlb96A.png\" /></figure><h3><strong>Personalized Marketing</strong></h3><p>The vast majority of customers, around 70% of them, consider personalized user experience a key factor in engaging with brands. Smartphones are quintessentially personal devices, and hence mobile apps can play a significant role in personalizing customer communication to a great extent.</p><p>By utilizing a mobile app, even small enterprises across the niches enjoy the opportunity to drive customer engagement and create strong bonds. The Indian small business sector is more evident as mobile apps are helping the so-called brick-and-mortar stores compete with big brands with a personalized experience.</p><p>Small business mobile app development India focuses on certain features, and user experience attributes push this personalization drive. For example, the use of personalized push notifications helps small enterprises connect customers easily with the right message and at the right time.</p><p>The personalized user experience can be augmented by utilizing the users’ data and location data to unleash mobile promotions, roll out new features, and create a better user experience.</p><h3><strong>Lead generation and Business Conversion</strong></h3><p>Lead generation and steady business conversion happen to be the two most important benefits of mobile apps for small businesses. Many small businesses that have limited scope in interacting directly with customers find mobile apps and social media channels as an effective medium to generate business leads.</p><p>Hyperlocal and highly context-aware marketing of services and products through mobile apps can easily push lead generation and increase business conversion. In addition, thanks to the powerful location-sensing technologies used by today’s mobile apps and because of the scope of using data-driven insights, mobile apps can play a great role in engaging customers based on their location and the specific user context.</p><p>A retail business now can easily facilitate omnichannel targeting of customers with the mobile apps playing the central role in coordinating with different channels. For instance, a mobile app for a retail brand can sync the customer experience and buying process between the online store and the physical store. You scan a product while window shopping, get informed about the product through the mobile app and make the purchase order from mobile.</p><h3><strong>Helping with Operational Ease and Cost-Saving</strong></h3><p>Mobile apps can get things done in a whizz when communicating with customers, solving their issues and providing customers what they want. Operational efficiency is a key reason for many small businesses to embrace mobile apps.</p><p>Companies relying heavily on the field staff can benefit tremendously from mobile apps. From monitoring the field staff in real-time to collaborating on service-related issues, mobile apps in more than one way can ensure operational ease in companies depending on field service or field professionals.</p><p>Thanks to real-time collaboration and the capability to track employees and tasks through mobile apps, businesses can also make considerable cost savings for operational tasks. Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.</p><h3><strong>Taking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps</strong></h3><p>With the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches. So today, you have doorstep food delivery apps, an on-demand app for barbers and beauticians, apps for housemaid services and apps for almost everything that can cater to on-demand needs.</p><p>The best thing about on-demand apps is that you don’t need to start a completely new business catering to the demands of the customers registered through a mobile app. You can either just turn your good old website or the existing mobile app into an on-demand app to cater to more customers, or you can just register with an aggregator or marketplace app and allow customers to buy your services or products through that app.</p><p>When it comes to in-demand apps, the sky’s the limit for a small business to prosper. For example, suppose you are a local grocery shop with a limited clientele. In that case, you can just build your grocery delivery app and offer doorstep delivery services throughout the whole city and even beyond the city limits.</p><p>On-demand <strong>app development in India</strong> is on the rise, thanks to the overwhelming number of unique services and solutions these apps are providing. For example, an app offering tattoo and body graffiti artists services in every city area can just be availed by the people and artist professionals alike.</p><h3><strong>Enhancing Customer Loyalty</strong></h3><p>A mobile app, unlike a website, doesn’t get lost in the clamour and noise of the web. It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often. But a customer using your app knows your brand more personal and is likely to interact with your brand quite often.</p><p>The mobile app can help retain users with more certainty than any other digital interface. The personalized push notifications, customer-centric value creation through loyalty programs and special offers can help boost customer footfall and brand loyalty. Mobile apps can be the right tool in the measures for customer loyalty enhancement.</p><h3><strong>Data-driven Decision Making</strong></h3><p>These days even small businesses understand the value of data and data-driven insights in the decision-making and strategy-building processes. This is where mobile apps play a very crucial role.

As the citadel of tech-driven small businesses and startups, India has already come to the forefront in turning mobile apps into its footprints. The Mobile app development India is now primarily engaged in shaping the mobile presence for small businesses and startups. When focusing on the Indian market, even the global tech giants prioritize the wants and preferences of small and medium enterprises across the niches.\nAs per the statistics published by AppAnnie, as of 2019, India stood globally in the 4th position among the countries with the highest concentration of Android users. There can hardly be any doubt that a considerable portion of these Android users and apps belong to small business apps. Other statistics confirm this. According to Cisco, 30% of the business it gets in India comes from SMEs. Big brands like Google, Microsoft and Amazon continue to focus on the Indian small enterprise market with unperturbed zeal. According to the latest data, more than 26 million small businesses in India have shaped their online presence by using various Google apps, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, etc.\nWhat makes small enterprises in India consider mobile apps so crucial for their businesses? Well, the reasons are too many. Mobile apps, apart from allowing exceptional ease of operation, can help a business do growth hacking. From robust mobile branding to delivering customer service, mobile apps play a crucial role for small businesses in some ways.\nLet us have a quick look at some of the key ways mobile apps can benefit small businesses.\n\nPersonalized Marketing\nThe vast majority of customers, around 70% of them, consider personalized user experience a key factor in engaging with brands. Smartphones are quintessentially personal devices, and hence mobile apps can play a significant role in personalizing customer communication to a great extent.\nBy utilizing a mobile app, even small enterprises across the niches enjoy the opportunity to drive customer engagement and create strong bonds. The Indian small business sector is more evident as mobile apps are helping the so-called brick-and-mortar stores compete with big brands with a personalized experience.\nSmall business mobile app development India focuses on certain features, and user experience attributes push this personalization drive. For example, the use of personalized push notifications helps small enterprises connect customers easily with the right message and at the right time.\nThe personalized user experience can be augmented by utilizing the users’ data and location data to unleash mobile promotions, roll out new features, and create a better user experience.\nLead generation and Business Conversion\nLead generation and steady business conversion happen to be the two most important benefits of mobile apps for small businesses. Many small businesses that have limited scope in interacting directly with customers find mobile apps and social media channels as an effective medium to generate business leads.\nHyperlocal and highly context-aware marketing of services and products through mobile apps can easily push lead generation and increase business conversion. In addition, thanks to the powerful location-sensing technologies used by today’s mobile apps and because of the scope of using data-driven insights, mobile apps can play a great role in engaging customers based on their location and the specific user context.\nA retail business now can easily facilitate omnichannel targeting of customers with the mobile apps playing the central role in coordinating with different channels. For instance, a mobile app for a retail brand can sync the customer experience and buying process between the online store and the physical store. You scan a product while window shopping, get informed about the product through the mobile app and make the purchase order from mobile.\nHelping with Operational Ease and Cost-Saving\nMobile apps can get things done in a whizz when communicating with customers, solving their issues and providing customers what they want. Operational efficiency is a key reason for many small businesses to embrace mobile apps.\nCompanies relying heavily on the field staff can benefit tremendously from mobile apps. From monitoring the field staff in real-time to collaborating on service-related issues, mobile apps in more than one way can ensure operational ease in companies depending on field service or field professionals.\nThanks to real-time collaboration and the capability to track employees and tasks through mobile apps, businesses can also make considerable cost savings for operational tasks. Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.\nTaking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps\nWith the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches. So today, you have doorstep food delivery apps, an on-demand app for barbers and beauticians, apps for housemaid services and apps for almost everything that can cater to on-demand needs.\nThe best thing about on-demand apps is that you don’t need to start a completely new business catering to the demands of the customers registered through a mobile app. You can either just turn your good old website or the existing mobile app into an on-demand app to cater to more customers, or you can just register with an aggregator or marketplace app and allow customers to buy your services or products through that app.\nWhen it comes to in-demand apps, the sky’s the limit for a small business to prosper. For example, suppose you are a local grocery shop with a limited clientele. In that case, you can just build your grocery delivery app and offer doorstep delivery services throughout the whole city and even beyond the city limits.\nOn-demand app development in India is on the rise, thanks to the overwhelming number of unique services and solutions these apps are providing. For example, an app offering tattoo and body graffiti artists services in every city area can just be availed by the people and artist professionals alike.\nEnhancing Customer Loyalty\nA mobile app, unlike a website, doesn’t get lost in the clamour and noise of the web. It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often. But a customer using your app knows your brand more personal and is likely to interact with your brand quite often.\nThe mobile app can help retain users with more certainty than any other digital interface. The personalized push notifications, customer-centric value creation through loyalty programs and special offers can help boost customer footfall and brand loyalty. Mobile apps can be the right tool in the measures for customer loyalty enhancement.\nData-driven Decision Making\nThese days even small businesses understand the value of data and data-driven insights in the decision-making and strategy-building processes. This is where mobile apps play a very crucial role. Mobile apps help a business capture various customer data referring to locations, preferences, online user behavior, taste and choices and other factors. This huge pool of customer data can help a business make decisions affecting sales and business conversion positively.\nFrom capturing the customer’s demographic data to knowing the exact location of the customers to understanding the actual context and situation of the customers, mobile apps can help a business with potential data inputs in numerous ways. For example, depending upon the time, season, urgency and other data, a customer can be approached at the right time that boosts the chances of more purchases.\nConclusion\nDid we mention all the benefits that mobile apps offer to small businesses? Unfortunately, we likely missed quite a few. But these advantages at least portray how small companies and startups can take advantage of a level playing field shared by big brands of their niches.\n\nHow Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India? was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Juned Ghanchi","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d45d1033fc57","categories":["mobile-app-developers","mobile-app-development","app-development","on-demand-app-development","app-development-india"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T10:41:45.000Z"},{"creator":"Tremis Skeete","title":"Three Types of Customers that Use Your Software Product","link":"https://productcoalition.com/three-types-of-customers-that-use-your-software-product-7bf6ed9f83b9?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 05:44:30 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>While there are many different customer types, they are essentially in three categories.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0nJmq7nWd7I0tX7bGuEkxA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Great digital products are not built in a vacuum.

Explain that the goal aligns stakeholders and the development team, directing their work. Explain that<strong> </strong>meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business.</p><p>b) <strong>Coaching the Scrum Team about the Sprint Goal: </strong>explain why it is important. Explain that<strong> </strong>a Sprint Goal serves to promote <strong><em>self-managing </em>and <em>creativity</em></strong>. It establishes the ‘<strong><em>why</em></strong>’ so the Development Team can work out the ‘<strong><em>how</em></strong>’.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*umkEyH9gwFaJdf--\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@enginakyurt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">engin akyurt</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Improve the Sprint Planning</h4><p>The Sprint Planning is an important moment to foster collaboration.</p><p>Be sure that the product backlog is prepared for the Sprint Planning, meaning that the Product Backlog Items are ordered, and the ones on the top are refined to a level the Team can start working on. This avoid a lot of discussion and let the developers concentrate on preparing a sprint where collaboration is the main focus.</p><p>This preparation could happen in many ways, as example thru pair programming, or by preparing the work in such a way that it can easily be shared.</p><h4><strong>Create the culture of asking “why”</strong></h4><p>The “<strong>what</strong>” and the “<strong>how</strong>” are important in the daily job of a team member. But the “<strong>why</strong>” we are doing things, is even more important.</p><p>For all members of the Scrum Team, it is the most efficient way to gain deeper insights into the projects they are working on. You can refine requirements by asking the right kinds of questions, based on the problem you are trying to solve. If you keep raising questions, you will keep finding better answers and implementing exactly what should be done.</p><p>As a Scrum Master coach the team that <strong>asking questions is a sign of strength and intelligence</strong>, not a sign of weakness or uncertainty. And especially when there is a hurry to get things done do not fall in the trap of<strong> stopping to ask questions because it might slow them down</strong>. This will avoid rushing into the wrong actions.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*fi44GDBX5PeTrBxb3ban6A.png\" /><figcaption>Photo by Evan Gupta <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/r8q16QN40Xg\">@unsplash.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Lately, I introduced and facilitated the use of the “Double Loop Learning” for searching the “<strong>why</strong>”. Personally, it helps me to challenge why unproductive behaviors are repeated. And it helps the entire team to overcome them.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*ly5LtTIHTKzBr0v72hGUnQ.png\" /></figure><blockquote><strong>Single-loop learning focuses on solving a problem within an existing system that is defined by sets of beliefs, structures, roles, procedures, and norms. Double-loop learning challenges the system, beliefs, and structures itself. — <em>Barry Overeem</em></strong></blockquote><p>The generic example I use to introduce the concept is this:<strong> An employee comes late to work</strong>. <em>Single loop learning</em>: How can I clarify the consequences of tardiness? How can we hire better employees? <em>Double-loop learning</em>: Why are some employers tardy? Why do I specify working times and monitor tardiness? Why does tardiness make me so unhappy?</p><p>Another example of <em>single-loop learning</em> is when a Product Owner tries to better capture requirements on the Product Backlog. Whereas <em>double-loop learning</em> might make her question the need for detailed requirements in an empirical process.</p><h4><strong>Coach how to give feedback: the STAR method</strong></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/429/1*o27gyTBlMAZu4TM9Qu4ixg.png\" /><figcaption>Photo by Daniel Elah <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/dChZrZx6mf8\">@unsplash.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>If there is trust in a group, the members are more likely to be able to engage in discussions and be open to new points of view. Discussions are a healthy way of improving the way forward.</p><p>But the discussion should be fact-based and respectful towards the other team members. I find the STAR method is a powerful tool for giving objective feedback.</p><p>Here are the 4 steps:</p><ul><li><strong>S</strong>ITUATION: in which the behavior took place</li><li><strong>T</strong>ASK: assigned task or expected behavior in line with the organizational culture</li><li><strong>A</strong>CTION: the observed behavior</li><li><strong>R</strong>ESULT: the effect resulting from the observed behavior</li></ul><p>Let´s see an example: Instead of telling “<strong>You were too negative in a meeting!</strong>”, following approach suits better acceptance:</p><ul><li><strong>S</strong>ITUATION: during yesterday’s meeting</li><li><strong>T</strong>ASK: we asked you to highlight the benefits of Mike’s proposal</li><li><strong>A</strong>CTION: instead, you described only the elements that in your opinion are ineffective</li><li><strong>R</strong>ESULT: and this generated silence in Mike and the team, making us miss a profitable discussion</li></ul><h4><strong>Use positive language</strong></h4><p>Language is the result of our thinking and our emotion</p><p>Positive language can direct our thinking towards solutions. And avoid us getting stuck on the problem.</p><p>Positive language is to be used when we want our interlocutor to perceive us as an ally.</p><p>Remember that a positive language fosters the Scrum Value of “<strong>respect</strong>”.</p><p>Examples of positive phrasing and language (more can be found in <a href=\"https://www.londonschool.com/nordic/blogg/power-positive-communication/\">The Power of Positive Communication</a>)</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Highlight what can be done</p><p>Example: <em>If you can send us (whatever), we can complete the process for you.</em></p><p><strong>2. </strong>Suggest alternatives and choices</p><p>Example: <em>One option open to you is (option)</em></p><p><strong>3.</strong> Sound helpful and encouraging rather than bureaucratic</p><p>Example: <em>Might we suggest that you (whatever)</em></p><h4><strong>Celebrate success</strong></h4><p>At the sprint planning, the Scrum Team set some goals for the upcoming sprint.</p><p>For the team morale it is good to celebrate the success of reaching such goals. As a Scrum Master foster the idea of celebration. A high-performing team is happy to see recognized the results of its hard work.</p><p>The Following Scrum events could be suitable for this celebration:</p><ul><li>During the <strong>Daily</strong>, when a goal is reached, this could be highlighted.</li><li>In each <strong>Sprint Review</strong>, when stakeholders are invited to participate. It is the time to celebrate the valuable increment which has just been delivered.</li><li>The <strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong> may also be a good place to celebrate some other wins that may not be of interest to the external stakeholders of the team.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*f3voTmr-DFdx_SUE\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@krakenimages?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">krakenimages</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Team collaboration is an important factor for team success.

I have seen it is very useful to have separate coaching, versus Product Owner and versus Developer.\na) Coaching the Product Owner about the Product Goal: explain why the goal is important. Explain that the goal aligns stakeholders and the development team, directing their work. Explain that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business.\nb) Coaching the Scrum Team about the Sprint Goal: explain why it is important. Explain that a Sprint Goal serves to promote self-managing and creativity. It establishes the ‘why’ so the Development Team can work out the ‘how’.\nPhoto by engin akyurt on Unsplash\nImprove the Sprint Planning\nThe Sprint Planning is an important moment to foster collaboration.\nBe sure that the product backlog is prepared for the Sprint Planning, meaning that the Product Backlog Items are ordered, and the ones on the top are refined to a level the Team can start working on. This avoid a lot of discussion and let the developers concentrate on preparing a sprint where collaboration is the main focus.\nThis preparation could happen in many ways, as example thru pair programming, or by preparing the work in such a way that it can easily be shared.\nCreate the culture of asking “why”\nThe “what” and the “how” are important in the daily job of a team member. But the “why” we are doing things, is even more important.\nFor all members of the Scrum Team, it is the most efficient way to gain deeper insights into the projects they are working on. You can refine requirements by asking the right kinds of questions, based on the problem you are trying to solve. If you keep raising questions, you will keep finding better answers and implementing exactly what should be done.\nAs a Scrum Master coach the team that asking questions is a sign of strength and intelligence, not a sign of weakness or uncertainty. And especially when there is a hurry to get things done do not fall in the trap of stopping to ask questions because it might slow them down. This will avoid rushing into the wrong actions.\nPhoto by Evan Gupta @unsplash.com\nLately, I introduced and facilitated the use of the “Double Loop Learning” for searching the “why”. Personally, it helps me to challenge why unproductive behaviors are repeated. And it helps the entire team to overcome them.\n\nSingle-loop learning focuses on solving a problem within an existing system that is defined by sets of beliefs, structures, roles, procedures, and norms. Double-loop learning challenges the system, beliefs, and structures itself. — Barry Overeem\nThe generic example I use to introduce the concept is this: An employee comes late to work. Single loop learning: How can I clarify the consequences of tardiness? How can we hire better employees? Double-loop learning: Why are some employers tardy? Why do I specify working times and monitor tardiness? Why does tardiness make me so unhappy?\nAnother example of single-loop learning is when a Product Owner tries to better capture requirements on the Product Backlog. Whereas double-loop learning might make her question the need for detailed requirements in an empirical process.\nCoach how to give feedback: the STAR method\nPhoto by Daniel Elah @unsplash.com\nIf there is trust in a group, the members are more likely to be able to engage in discussions and be open to new points of view. Discussions are a healthy way of improving the way forward.\nBut the discussion should be fact-based and respectful towards the other team members. I find the STAR method is a powerful tool for giving objective feedback.\nHere are the 4 steps:\n\nSITUATION: in which the behavior took place\nTASK: assigned task or expected behavior in line with the organizational culture\nACTION: the observed behavior\nRESULT: the effect resulting from the observed behavior\n\nLet´s see an example: Instead of telling “You were too negative in a meeting!”, following approach suits better acceptance:\n\nSITUATION: during yesterday’s meeting\nTASK: we asked you to highlight the benefits of Mike’s proposal\nACTION: instead, you described only the elements that in your opinion are ineffective\nRESULT: and this generated silence in Mike and the team, making us miss a profitable discussion\n\nUse positive language\nLanguage is the result of our thinking and our emotion\nPositive language can direct our thinking towards solutions. And avoid us getting stuck on the problem.\nPositive language is to be used when we want our interlocutor to perceive us as an ally.\nRemember that a positive language fosters the Scrum Value of “respect”.\nExamples of positive phrasing and language (more can be found in The Power of Positive Communication)\n1. Highlight what can be done\nExample: If you can send us (whatever), we can complete the process for you.\n2. Suggest alternatives and choices\nExample: One option open to you is (option)\n3. Sound helpful and encouraging rather than bureaucratic\nExample: Might we suggest that you (whatever)\nCelebrate success\nAt the sprint planning, the Scrum Team set some goals for the upcoming sprint.\nFor the team morale it is good to celebrate the success of reaching such goals. As a Scrum Master foster the idea of celebration. A high-performing team is happy to see recognized the results of its hard work.\nThe Following Scrum events could be suitable for this celebration:\n\nDuring the Daily, when a goal is reached, this could be highlighted.\nIn each Sprint Review, when stakeholders are invited to participate. It is the time to celebrate the valuable increment which has just been delivered.\nThe Sprint Retrospective may also be a good place to celebrate some other wins that may not be of interest to the external stakeholders of the team.\nPhoto by krakenimages on Unsplash\nConclusion\nTeam collaboration is an important factor for team success. The Scrum Master should watch the status of the collaboration, and continuously improve it.\nThe six suggestions discussed previously provide you with concrete tools for archiving it.\n\nDo you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?\n\nScrum Master: 6 Concrete Ways to Improve Collaboration was originally published in Serious Scrum on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Alessandro Zanetti","guid":"https://medium.com/p/45f01ca630f8","categories":["team-building","serious-scrum","agile","coaching","scrum-master"],"isoDate":"2021-05-19T16:38:19.000Z"},{"creator":"hunterwalk","title":"How Pro Skateboarder Tony Hawk Made Me A Better Parent","link":"https://hunterwalk.com/2021/05/19/how-pro-skateboarder-tony-hawk-made-me-a-better-parent/","pubDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 16:02:28 +0000","content:encoded":"\n<h2 id=\"d3e2\">Teaching my daughter that ‘adventure boo-boos’ are part of life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I come from a family of flinchers.

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;</li>\r\n\t<li>Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;</li>\r\n\t<li>Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>Holding each other accountable as professionals.</li>\r\n</ul></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#developers\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team’s Product Owner supports creating a shared understanding among all Scrum team members on the why, the what, and the how. However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>The Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/developers-dont-talk-customers-fallacy-making-your-scrum-wor/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers Code Fallacy — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity. It is a sign for an organization still profoundly stuck in industrial paradigm thinking.\n\r\n\r\nJoin me and explore the reasons and the consequences of this Scrum anti-pattern in 110 seconds.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:\n\r\n\r\n\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCreating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n\r\n\t\nInstilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nAdapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n\r\n\t\nHolding each other accountable as professionals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nThe team’s Product Owner supports creating a shared understanding among all Scrum team members on the why, the what, and the how. However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.\n \r\n\r\nThe Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers Code Fallacy — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nIf your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”\n\r\n\r\nWhat other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/949391/svod-subscribers-world/\">sources</a>, global OTT subscriptions are expected to reach over 1.1 billion.</p><p>SVOD is short for Subscription Video-On-Demand, which refers to a monetization model where subscribers pay a monthly or annual fee to access video content on streaming SVOD platforms.</p><h4><strong>The Best VOD Monetization Model is Subscription Video On Demand</strong></h4><p>If you’re looking for a steady revenue model for your video content on OTT platforms, VOD subscriptions rank high.</p><p>For example, let’s discuss the video subscription platform, Netflix: In the first quarter of 2021, Netflix had over <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/\">208 million subscribers</a>.

For influencers in the exercise and wellness niche, this is an opportunity to provide content for their fitness enthusiasts to practice their routine at home.

According to sources, global OTT subscriptions are expected to reach over 1.1 billion.\nSVOD is short for Subscription Video-On-Demand, which refers to a monetization model where subscribers pay a monthly or annual fee to access video content on streaming SVOD platforms.\nThe Best VOD Monetization Model is Subscription Video On Demand\nIf you’re looking for a steady revenue model for your video content on OTT platforms, VOD subscriptions rank high.\nFor example, let’s discuss the video subscription platform, Netflix: In the first quarter of 2021, Netflix had over 208 million subscribers. A decade ago, in 2011, the number was lesser than 22 million.\nAs you can see, the growth is tremendous. With the pandemic forcing people to stay at home, many OTT platforms like HBO Go, Disney+ are entering the market. The revenue from this monetization model is expected to reach $71 billion in 2021.\nLet’s get into how you can benefit from SVOD:\n- Have a consistent revenue stream with monthly, annual fees\n- Set your price based on the quality of your content\n- Accumulate a loyal customer base\n-Create a tight-knit community with exclusive content\nWhen to Monetize With SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand)\nLive Entertainment\n\nWith people glued to their screens for entertainment, live concerts, poetry reading, theatre shows are seeing more watch time. Even though movies and TV shows see a lot of viewership on video subscription service platforms, customers aren’t averse to watch any form of the niche they love performed live.\nExercise and Wellness\n\nWith gyms and public wellness classes being shut down or temporarily unavailable, many have taken to working out in their home gyms. For influencers in the exercise and wellness niche, this is an opportunity to provide content for their fitness enthusiasts to practice their routine at home. It could be a live yoga session or a recorded HIIT and Zumba class; either way the loyal subscribers are up for it.\nSports Streaming\n\nFor sports fanatics, who crave the excitement of cheering for their team, catching a game at home has never stopped such enthusiasm. With a video subscription website or an application, the same streaming can be done for a subscription fee rather than regular satellite television.\nOnline Education and e-Learning\n\nFrom schools and colleges to corporate companies, education is now seeing a drastic shift towards online video subscription platforms. While the pandemic is one of the reasons that contribute to this shift, many online courses have been helping students and professionals gather skills for a long time. Institutes also agree that e-learning has led to significant cost reduction.\nTop 5 OTT Platforms To Create Subscription Video On Demand Services in 2021\nIf you’re looking to start a successful OTT video subscription business?

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li>\r\n\t<li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>There Is no Failure Culture</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a precise and concise yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. While the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum, stakeholders themselves are no official role (accountability), no matter their crucial contribution to a Scrum team’s overall success.\n\r\n\r\nExplore with me three widespread examples of how stakeholders fail their Scrum teams in three short video clips, totaling 6 minutes and 5 seconds.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

While stakeholders are not an official accountability, the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum:\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nPage 4: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.\n\r\n\t\nPage 5: The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.\n\r\n\t\nPage 8: The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.\n\r\n\t\nPage 8: [Sprint Planning: Why is this Sprint valuable?] The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nPage 9: The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.\n\r\n\t\nPage 9: During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.\n\r\n\t\nPage 10: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.\n\r\n\t\nPage 10: These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nPage 12: However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.\n\r\n\t\nPage 12: The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on stakeholders.

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\n\r\n\t\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\n\r\n\t\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\n \r\n\r\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\n\r\n\r\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">generate as much buy-in as possible</a>, as I explain in more detail in my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16393\">Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People</a>.&#8221; But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don&#8217;t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires <em>full-stack ownership</em>: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a> to the product details. The individual should carry out<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\"> product discovery</a> and strategy work in addition to taking care of the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog work</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">Scaling the Product Owner</a>.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png\" alt=\"Full-stack product owner vs. partial product owner\" class=\"wp-image-17099\" width=\"661\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-300x147.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-768x377.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO.png 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Be therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the product owner, you should focus on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10812\">product</a>, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">sacrifice your health</a>—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">care about the development teams</a> you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-owner-sprint-retrospective/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8232\">sprint retrospective</a>. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how <em>you</em> can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery work</a>, spending more time jointly <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/refining-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15179\">refining the product backlog</a>, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">review finished work</a> results during the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">Refining the product backlog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">writing user stories</a> is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is important that you don&#8217;t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a>, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-planning-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14390\">create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint</a> and succeed in meeting the sprint goal. If the items are too big and coarse-grained, most teams will struggle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, strike the right balance between strategic and tactical work and spend enough time working on the product backlog together with the development team members. As the product owner, it&#8217;s your responsibility that the work required to progress the product and reach the (next) <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">product goal</a> is adequately captured in the product backlog. Such a backlog has enough “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>” high-priority items to guide the work of the development team and to allow its members to create a “done” product increment—executable software that is tested and documented and that could be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #5: It’s the product owner’s job to get the project delivered</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional approaches to software development, Scrum does not offer the role of a project manager. It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a <em>product management</em> role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it. To put it differently, you can think of the product owner as a product life-cycle manager, which encourages decisions that result in sustainable growth and consider the product’s longer-term impact on the users and the business. The picture below illustrates this concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png\" alt=\"Product owner and the product life cycle\" class=\"wp-image-17100\" width=\"525\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png 1008w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-300x235.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture above shows how a product might create value over time together with three key events: launching the product, achieving product-market fit, and retiring the product (end of life). Only once it has achieved product-market fit (PMF) and entered the growth stage, has a product started to become successful. A product owner should therefore look after a product at least until PMF, preferably longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with the job of a project manager who is responsible for delivering a project to an agreed scope on time and on budget. Once that’s been achieved, the project manager’s work is done, and the individual often moves on and works on another project, which might progress a different product. A project manager is therefore focused on a comparatively short-term effort instead of a longer-term outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, avoid being a <em>project</em> owner but aspire to manage your product for an extended period, ideally for its entire life cycle. This does not imply, however, that you should not care about meeting a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goal</a> in a realistic timeframe on an agreed budget. The opposite is the case: Use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release planning tools and techniques</a> that work for you to track and guide the development progress. But create a continuity of purpose by working with a product roadmap like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO roadmap</a> that captures the specific outcomes the product is likely to create in the next six to twelve months.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/\">Five Product Owner Myths Busted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Myth #1: The product owner must ensure that the stakeholders are satisfied\nStakeholders can be powerful and influential individuals. But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal stakeholders such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.\nAt the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and generate as much buy-in as possible, as I explain in more detail in my article “Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People.” But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don’t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.\nMyth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog\nIn Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires full-stack ownership: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the product vision to the product details. The individual should carry out product discovery and strategy work in addition to taking care of the product backlog work.\nBut the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “Scaling the Product Owner.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.\n\nBe therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role.

But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. Refining the product backlog and writing user stories is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones.

Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nCreate and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my upcoming training classes here.\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\n\r\n\r\nIt helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nWhat principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches. We appreciate a new ebook on dealing with difficult stakeholders and critical situations, and we learn a simple approach to measuring team productivity: Don’t touch velocity! </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we learn that Gitlab identified a new DevOps maturity model. </p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #291: Hypotheses Validation, Authentic Feedback, Measuring Productivity, The Art of Removing Features — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65945\" data-wp-pid=\"65945\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65937\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-290-design-thinking-scrum/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #290: Design Thinking Scrum, Product vs. Project Teams, Agile Leadership Practice Library, Disrupting Disrupters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #290</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.\n\r\n\r\nWe then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches.

Assume as CEO that it will be impossible to retain 100% of your employees no matter what you decide. There’s going to be a talent reshuffling for the next 6–24 months IMO as employees decide whether their current employer’s workplace strategy is right for them or not.\nAnd resist the urge to reduce this to assumptions like “equitable workplaces are those with the fewest mandates.” These choices are complex, often with unintended consequences. Flexible schedules more friendly for women? Unclear according to this WSJ article:\nDenise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, said hybrid models appear to offer the benefits of both worlds. But they could inadvertently disadvantage women, who shoulder the bulk of caregiving duties and may be more likely to seek more home-based arrangements and miss out on professional face-time, she said. Any solution to one problem will raise other challenges, she said.\n\n\n\n\nThe President of Barnard College fears similar and notes it’s about systems of choices, not just a single decision:\nSo what should well-intentioned companies and managers do? If you think flexible work will boost equity, especially for parents, it is critical to consider what other policies and practices must be in place to advance this goal. Providing paid family and parental leave — as opposed to just maternity leave — and encouraging employees to take it is one example. Ensuring managers do not favor in-person employees for mentorships, in evaluations or for other opportunities is another.\n\n\n\n\nSo start thinking about what’s right for your stage of company, the type of product you build, the culture you’ve created, and then prepare for a lot of communication over the second half of the year.","dc:creator":"hunterwalk","content":"Engage your team and understand their needs but craft your “Return To Office” strategy from the top down We’ve backed a wide variety of startups at Homebrew but the CEOs are now all coalescing around one theme: it’s time to start making choices about what ‘back to the office’ looks like (note 95%+ of our [&#8230;]","contentSnippet":"Engage your team and understand their needs but craft your “Return To Office” strategy from the top down We’ve backed a wide variety of startups at Homebrew but the CEOs are now all coalescing around one theme: it’s time to start making choices about what ‘back to the office’ looks like (note 95%+ of our […]","guid":"https://hunterwalk.com/?p=9317","categories":["Uncategorized"],"isoDate":"2021-05-08T04:05:17.000Z"},{"creator":"Stefan Wolpers","title":"The Blame Game Retrospective — Making Your Scrum Work #6","link":"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/","pubDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 13:07:10 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>TL; DR: The Blame Game Retrospective </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum.

The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\u000b\r\n\t<li>Commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b</li>\r\n\t<li>If Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives — Scrum Values — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65925\" data-wp-pid=\"65925\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/data-informed-retrospectives/\" title=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data-Informed Retrospectives</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0EHmvUIngkQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure.

The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThe Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: \n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nCommitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b\n\r\n\t\nIf Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure. Among those, the blame game, the finger-pointing, is the most obvious and challenging that requires the utmost attention from all team members to overcome.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sprint Retrospective anti-patterns have you observed?

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner\" title=\"The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Oversized Product Backlogs</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>The Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Garbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers &#038; the organization. </li>\r\n\t<li>The Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpet3ZRyTx34%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Product Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You are likely to end up in a feature factory.</li>\r\n\t<li>Probably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" title=\"Conway’s law\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conway’s law</a>: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.”)</li>\r\n\t<li>If you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fgc15kRtrNVg%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>I Know What to Build—Follow Me!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks &#038; balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0Zl-FMOjS9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point.

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:\n\r\n\r\nOversized Product Backlogs\n \r\n\r\nThe Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nGarbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are likely to end up in a feature factory.\n\r\n\t\nProbably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (Conway’s law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”)\n\r\n\t\nIf you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know What to Build—Follow Me!\n\r\n\r\nIn this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. \n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks & balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Product Owner failures have you observed?

For those who know me well, it’s pretty much, “Yeah, duh.” But for those who have only been exposed to me in public settings, or online, there’s usually more surprise that a venture capitalist like me could be an introvert.&nbsp;People sometimes mistake introversion for shyness or lack of confidence.&nbsp;But it’s really about whether being with people&nbsp;<em>gives</em>&nbsp;you energy or&nbsp;<em>takes</em>&nbsp;energy away.&nbsp;I love people, I just need adequate amounts of time to recharge, usually spent by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re human, which means the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/a-year-of-zoom-genitals-bourbon-bottles-child-rearing-632167ea052d\">past 12 months</a>&nbsp;were probably pretty tumultuous for you. My family has been incredibly fortunate and hopefully, the long-term consequences are going to be minimal. Lately, I’ve found myself mostly trying to figure out what lessons my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/what-lessons-will-our-children-learn-from-covid19-and-will-they-be-useful-ones-e2635eb3dfe7\">daughter should learn from this time</a>, and what lessons we specifically&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;want her to carry throughout her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to my job, after practicing venture capital for seven years under normal circumstances, it was instructive to get thrown into this new scenario, because I don’t think we’ll ever fully “return to normal.” Instead, we’ll blend aspects of pre-2020 and our experiences from the past year into a “new normal.” This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people. It’s a work-in-process but here’s what I’m thinking:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Group events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, these would always trip me up. I would experience some social anxiety mixed with generally feeling overwhelmed by my own internal scorecarding and thoughts of, “Am I networking enough?” Now on Zoom, I can just fall back to audio-only, or drop off the gathering when I’m ready to leave. (What’s the “turn off video” equivalent for me when being at a large event? Probably peeling away with a person or two for the ol’ walk and talk.) Going forward, I think virtual events will continue to evolve beyond the Zoom room and into formats like Icebreaker. I can’t say that Covid-19 has made me rethink the personal utility of the really big conferences (I don’t attend many), but it does make me miss the curation of smaller groups.&nbsp;The events where hosts put effort into bringing together people with a high degree of purpose and work hard to ensure mixing, those are wonderful. My 2022 will hopefully include a return to events like these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working with founders</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what I really have missed.&nbsp;You might think I’m referring to the time spent with a founder before deciding to make an investment in their startup, and certainly, there are moments where an in-person conversation can be the difference between Deal or No Deal. But I don’t think we’ll ever go back to 100% in-person pitching, especially in the earliest stages of getting to know someone.&nbsp;It’s just too mutually efficient to make a first pitch into a call or video, especially if the founders prefer it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>What I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.&nbsp;Not the perfunctory showing up in person for a board meeting (although sometimes being there is important), but rather the stuff which requires as much EQ (or emotional intelligence) as IQ. And I’m anticipating doing a lot of this in the places our portfolio companies are scattered: the Bay Area, New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Toronto, Portland, San Diego, Boston, Salt Lake City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I sense lots of startup teams are ready to get back into offices as well or at least have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/the-essential-nature-of-in-person-work-for-early-stage-startups-3a19e24342fc\">flexibility to work in-person</a>&nbsp;for the periods where collaboration and culture-building are most essential. If I were early in my career, it would absolutely be my preference to work for a company with an in-office culture (either full-time or hybrid). There’s just so much community and&nbsp;learning-by-osmosis (or serendipity) that comes from being together.&nbsp;So while our VC firm&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homebrew.co/\">Homebrew</a>&nbsp;definitely invests in companies that are 100% remote/distributed, we also espouse being intentional about what it means to do so and not underinvest in the infrastructure, travel, and skill-building it takes to succeed in this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work-life balance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we still call it this?&nbsp;How about just happiness and sanity?&nbsp;I’ve found that I really enjoy driving my kid to school on Friday mornings. I’ve found that playing backgammon with my wife over lunch is nice when our mutual schedules accommodate. I’ve grown increasingly fond of just talking on the phone with a founder for five minutes when they need some help (versus going back and forth over email).&nbsp;Optimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain.&nbsp;My weekdays are basically 80% Homebrew, 20% family, with my weekends being the reverse.

For those who know me well, it’s pretty much, “Yeah, duh.” But for those who have only been exposed to me in public settings, or online, there’s usually more surprise that a venture capitalist like me could be an introvert. People sometimes mistake introversion for shyness or lack of confidence. But it’s really about whether being with people gives you energy or takes energy away. I love people, I just need adequate amounts of time to recharge, usually spent by myself.\nIf you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re human, which means the past 12 months were probably pretty tumultuous for you. My family has been incredibly fortunate and hopefully, the long-term consequences are going to be minimal. Lately, I’ve found myself mostly trying to figure out what lessons my daughter should learn from this time, and what lessons we specifically don’t want her to carry throughout her life.\nThis has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people.\nWhen it comes to my job, after practicing venture capital for seven years under normal circumstances, it was instructive to get thrown into this new scenario, because I don’t think we’ll ever fully “return to normal.” Instead, we’ll blend aspects of pre-2020 and our experiences from the past year into a “new normal.” This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people. It’s a work-in-process but here’s what I’m thinking:\nGroup events\nIn the past, these would always trip me up. I would experience some social anxiety mixed with generally feeling overwhelmed by my own internal scorecarding and thoughts of, “Am I networking enough?” Now on Zoom, I can just fall back to audio-only, or drop off the gathering when I’m ready to leave. (What’s the “turn off video” equivalent for me when being at a large event? Probably peeling away with a person or two for the ol’ walk and talk.) Going forward, I think virtual events will continue to evolve beyond the Zoom room and into formats like Icebreaker. I can’t say that Covid-19 has made me rethink the personal utility of the really big conferences (I don’t attend many), but it does make me miss the curation of smaller groups. The events where hosts put effort into bringing together people with a high degree of purpose and work hard to ensure mixing, those are wonderful. My 2022 will hopefully include a return to events like these.\nWorking with founders\nThis is what I really have missed. You might think I’m referring to the time spent with a founder before deciding to make an investment in their startup, and certainly, there are moments where an in-person conversation can be the difference between Deal or No Deal. But I don’t think we’ll ever go back to 100% in-person pitching, especially in the earliest stages of getting to know someone. It’s just too mutually efficient to make a first pitch into a call or video, especially if the founders prefer it.\n\nWhat I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.\n\n\n\n\nBut what I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard. Not the perfunctory showing up in person for a board meeting (although sometimes being there is important), but rather the stuff which requires as much EQ (or emotional intelligence) as IQ. And I’m anticipating doing a lot of this in the places our portfolio companies are scattered: the Bay Area, New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Toronto, Portland, San Diego, Boston, Salt Lake City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and so on.\nFor what it’s worth, I sense lots of startup teams are ready to get back into offices as well or at least have the flexibility to work in-person for the periods where collaboration and culture-building are most essential. If I were early in my career, it would absolutely be my preference to work for a company with an in-office culture (either full-time or hybrid). There’s just so much community and learning-by-osmosis (or serendipity) that comes from being together. So while our VC firm Homebrew definitely invests in companies that are 100% remote/distributed, we also espouse being intentional about what it means to do so and not underinvest in the infrastructure, travel, and skill-building it takes to succeed in this model.\nWork-life balance\nDo we still call it this? How about just happiness and sanity? I’ve found that I really enjoy driving my kid to school on Friday mornings. I’ve found that playing backgammon with my wife over lunch is nice when our mutual schedules accommodate. I’ve grown increasingly fond of just talking on the phone with a founder for five minutes when they need some help (versus going back and forth over email). Optimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain. My weekdays are basically 80% Homebrew, 20% family, with my weekends being the reverse. So far it’s worked out pretty well, except I think my dog is going to be shocked when we’re not in the house with her 24/7.\n\nOptimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain.\n\n\n\n\nHomebrew closed its office in San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood last March, and we’ve only been in there a handful of times since.

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want to offer a product that <em>reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes </em>and that <em>generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app</em>. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">strategy validation techniques</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> I have captured on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">Product Goals in Scrum</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to <em>allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base</em>. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen <em>user feedback</em>, <em>net promoter score</em>, and <em>referral rate</em>, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, <em>acquire an initial user base</em>, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Health Indicators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/technical-debt-and-product-success/\">technical debt</a>, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less is More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better.

Misinformation, trolling, harassment, polarization, and the resulting negative implications — none of these are as simple to define as CTR or CPM. I myself fell victim to this during my time leading the consumer product team at YouTube. When Google leadership asked us to shift from focusing solely on user growth to also increasing monetization, the team we destaffed to fund the new effort had been working on the comments system. Yup, YouTube comments, which most often resulted in a lot of name-calling, profanity, and worse. We all wanted it to improve, but why did I sacrifice this project in the near term?

It’s not crazy to wonder this, and while I don’t believe that it’s a true correlation or that our social platforms are intentionally running at the efficient frontier of anger and profits, I do always wonder what <a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/is-the-quest-for-software-margins-to-blame-for-twitters-trolls-facebook-s-russians-and-1ef0bef605bc\">margin pressure</a> does to, say, adequate investment in trust and safety.<br><br>Casey Newton’s <em>Platformer</em> article about <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/facebooks-ai-reckoning?r=2c7b&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy\">Facebook’s Responsible A.I. team</a> provoked a combination of eagerness and skepticism. My fear is that even if these teams are actually equipped to study and challenge internally held beliefs about their products, they will be forbidden from making changes that negatively impact business metrics. That is to say, we want responsibility but only when it doesn’t put the stock price at risk. I say this not just (or specifically) about Facebook, but more generally about the complexity of incentives within a corporation.

While much of Silicon Valley was already curtailing travel and starting to work from home, zeitgeist watchers note a perfect storm of the NBA suspending their season, Tom Hanks being diagnosed as positive, WHO declaring a global pandemic and He Which Shall Not Be Named implementing a travel ban (actually a good idea) as the starting point for “this isn’t just the flu.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading&nbsp;Maya Kosoff’s ‘<a href=\"https://kosoff.medium.com/i-always-knew-2020-was-going-to-be-a-lost-year-8889807949bf\">Lost Year</a>’ essay as part of Medium’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/tag/pandemic-reflections\">Pandemic Reflections</a>&nbsp;made me consider my own past 12 months. Because of my love for this thing we call the World Wide Web, I’m going to do my own reminiscing via Five Links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID Tracking Project</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An oasis in a misinformation desert, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/\">COVID Tracking Project&nbsp;</a>started very ad hoc but was always authoritative and reliable in trying to understand the illness’ spread. Good data helped put so much in perspective: that this thing was running wild, that it was disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and geographies and that outside of vaccines, the spread *could* be managed via safety practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the numbers got larger and we almost numbed to the milestones, I stopped focusing on the quantitative and transitioned to the qualitative, namely how to emotionally support my family and my community. The COVID Tracking Project will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/covid-tracking-project-end-march-7\">discontinue updating</a>&nbsp;on its first anniversary (March 7, 2021) but it was one of the URLs that defined my first year of COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Casey Newton &amp; I Got&nbsp;Zoombombed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on this whole WFH thing was kinda silly and fun in the tech industry.

I got to say things like “I’ve never ordered so much Goldbelly!” while others lost paychecks and family members. My friend Nikhil summarized so many of my thoughts in his essay&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nbt.substack.com/p/a-widening-gap\">A Widening Gap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A widening gap. A gap between the “haves” and the “have nots,” between those with disposable income and those that don’t have jobs.&nbsp;A gap between fact and fiction, between those that have access to the truth and those that are fed lies non-stop. A gap that’s been exacerbated by the pandemic, certainly, but also by the forces of technology, media, and politics, not just in the last four years, but for the past decade.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It will take considerable work, across technology, media, and government, to reverse this course. There isn’t a simple solution that will be the&nbsp;</em>next big thing<em>&nbsp;in 2021; instead, it’s going to take years of effort.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I appreciate about Nikhil’s blog post was that it’s not just about tech’ing our way out of this dynamic, but about empathy, caring and even some sacrifice. “Do Things That Don’t Scale” is classic startup advice and I feel the same way about the beginnings of what it takes to reverse these inequality dynamics. Beyond structural change, if we each just cared for a handful of other people in a way that extended beyond our immediate circles, we’d make so much progress. It’s why I love direct action nonprofits such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://detroitwaterproject.org/\">Human Utility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Virtual Drinking Buddies</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years when people asked what my hobbies were I’d kind of shrug my shoulders. There were activities I enjoyed (movies! friends! work!) but nothing that I’d consider a ‘hobby.’&nbsp;Maybe I’d been overly influenced by the people around me who, when they pursued something, did so with a focus that turned “jogging” into “complete marathons on all continents” and “cooking” into “I’m spending the summer in France as an apprentice pastry baker.”&nbsp;If a hobby equated to something you spent too much time and money on, then my only hobby was therapy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’d gotten tired of not having an answer and started telling folks my hobbies were&nbsp;coffee and notebooks (the paper note-taking kind).&nbsp;These were honest answers as I do enjoy researching, purchasing and consuming both of these, but there’s only so far you can go with notebooks and on the coffee front, I cared more about good beans than necessarily experimenting with every prep method, which meant the subreddits were a bit too much for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-forward to the beginning of 2020 and the whiplash we all experienced with travel stopping, restaurants closing and our homes becoming work, play, live 24/7. We’ve all adopted new coping mechanisms and found new aspects to our relationships. Some even used the time to reconsider where they work or move to new cities. Me?&nbsp;I got into whiskey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before sharing more I want to acknowledge that alcohol as a “hobby” can be jarring for many. People close to me have dealt with various addictions, including alcohol, and many more have removed it from their lifestyle in the interest of health, mental clarity and other benefits. Fortunately I’m not prone to over-consumption and my interest has been as much about the history, business and people around the spirit as actual consumption (I’m basically a 1–4 oz type of guy — for reference, the average 750ml bottle is roughly 25 ounces).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d previously been whiskey-curious, buying a bottle every now and then, trying different bourbons in a bar and so on. But about a year ago I joined a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SFWhiskies/\">local Bay Area whiskey group</a>&nbsp;that I’ve enjoyed learning from, sharing with and doing virtual tastings.

While much of Silicon Valley was already curtailing travel and starting to work from home, zeitgeist watchers note a perfect storm of the NBA suspending their season, Tom Hanks being diagnosed as positive, WHO declaring a global pandemic and He Which Shall Not Be Named implementing a travel ban (actually a good idea) as the starting point for “this isn’t just the flu.”\nReading Maya Kosoff’s ‘Lost Year’ essay as part of Medium’s Pandemic Reflections made me consider my own past 12 months. Because of my love for this thing we call the World Wide Web, I’m going to do my own reminiscing via Five Links.\nThe COVID Tracking Project\nAn oasis in a misinformation desert, the COVID Tracking Project started very ad hoc but was always authoritative and reliable in trying to understand the illness’ spread. Good data helped put so much in perspective: that this thing was running wild, that it was disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and geographies and that outside of vaccines, the spread *could* be managed via safety practices.\nAs the numbers got larger and we almost numbed to the milestones, I stopped focusing on the quantitative and transitioned to the qualitative, namely how to emotionally support my family and my community. The COVID Tracking Project will discontinue updating on its first anniversary (March 7, 2021) but it was one of the URLs that defined my first year of COVID.\nWhen Casey Newton & I Got Zoombombed\nEarly on this whole WFH thing was kinda silly and fun in the tech industry.

Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied.

Some view it as the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a>, others equate it to the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">value proposition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a <em>specific and measurable benefit or outcome</em> a product should create in the course of the next <em>two to six months</em>. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are <em>connected to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a></em> and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16846\" width=\"482\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png 993w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-300x252.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-768x644.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The Product Goal in Context</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal.

When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal. It took me years to come up with the set of goals in figure 1. In hindsight, the set looks disappointingly simple <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the contents of this article on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my YouTube Channel</a>:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Product Goals In Scrum\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0NWukbHkDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sample Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand how the goals in figure 1 can be applied, let’s take a look at an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16847\" width=\"491\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-300x237.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-768x606.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Sample Goals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 2, I first captured the vision “Help people eat healthily” and then used it to choose the user and business goals “Reduce the risk of developing type-two diabetes; create new revenue source.” In order to determine the right product goal, I asked myself, “What would be a first good step to meet the from the user and business goal?” I consequently chose the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” I then used this goal to determine the right sprint goal. I figured that finding out if users are willing to share personal information when activating the app would be the most important risk to address and hence should be the goal of the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I chose to use a <em>compound product goal</em> in figure 2 that has a user part—help the users understand their eating habits and business—and a business one—acquire an initial user base. Both parts are closely connected: In order to acquire a user base, the product must offer tangible value to the users, and a first step to help people eat more healthily is to help them become aware of their current eating habits. You don’t have to work with compound product goals of course, if you prefer to focus your objectives on either the user or the business benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Roadmap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting a single product goal is great. But unless you can’t see further than the next few months, I recommend determining the next three to four product goals and capturing them on your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, as figure 3 below shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16848\" width=\"569\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-300x197.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-768x505.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals.png 1197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Sample GO Product Roadmap with Product Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 3 shows a sample roadmap based on my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/the-go-product-roadmap/\">GO product roadmap template</a>, which contains three product goals. Each goal builds on the previous one thereby nicely progressing the product: The first goal helps the users become aware of their eating habits and creates and initial user base. The second one helps people improve their eating habits and acquires additional users. The third product goal, finally, helps the users improve their overall fitness and generates revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Scrum Guide does not mention identifying future product goals and adding them to the product roadmap, I find this practice very helpful: Stakeholders and dev teams usually benefit from understanding how to product is likely to evolve beyond the next two to three months. This helps the individuals create an effective sales and marketing strategy, for example, and to make the right architecture and technology decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Backlog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a product roadmap in place, I like to select the product goal to be worked on and copy it from the roadmap to the product backlog together with any coarse-grained features that are associated with the goal. This approach is illustrated by figure 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16849\" width=\"570\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-300x81.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-768x207.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog.png 1187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Product Goal and Product Backlog</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of using a product goal in the backlog is that it focuses the latter, as I describe in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">The Product Roadmap and the Product Backlog</a>.” This addresses a common issue: Many product backlogs I have seen over the years were too big and too detailed. This made them hard to prioritise and difficult to update, which is bad news as long as your product is young or experiences more than small, incremental changes. In most cases, the product backlogs grew so big because they lacked a measure to decide which items should be added to the backlog and which should not. The product goal is this measure: <em>Only add an item to the product backlog if it helps meet the product goal</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s briefly explore how a product goal might be used on the product backlog. Say I was to start the development of my healthy eating product, I would copy the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base” into the product backlog together with the features “healthy eating dashboard” and “integration with smart watches and fitness devices.” I’d ask myself which additional features are required to meet the product goal and add these to the backlog. I would the start breaking some of the features into <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"538\">prioritise the product backlog</a>. Finally, I’d refine the high-priority items to be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> to start the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can tell, I like product goals and find them very helpful, and I would encourage you to try them out if you haven’t used them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">Product Goals in Scrum</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Product Goals Defined\nThe Scrum Guide released in November 2020 states that “the product goal describes a future state of the product … [It] is the long-term objective for the Scrum team.” It also suggests that “the product goal is in the product backlog.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”</h3><p>(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up <a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/\">here</a>.)</p><p>Given rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.</p><p>To answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Seek high-growth companies.</strong> These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.</li><li><strong>Build your network of peers and mentors.</strong> These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.</li><li><strong>Be ready to learn and unlearn.</strong> One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.</li><li><strong>Working with humans is hard! </strong>Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.</li></ol><p>Below, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.</p><h3>1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)</h3><p>Trip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.</p><p>Early at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:</p><ol><li><strong>How to ship a product on time.</strong> Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.</li><li><strong>How to deal with imposter syndrome.</strong> Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”</li></ol><p>Electronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.</p><p>In my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:</p><ol><li>Here’s what you did well</li><li>Here’s what you could have done better.</li></ol><p>My mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.</p><h3>1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)</h3><p>Greg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:</p><ol><li><strong>Greg forced me out of the building to connect with peers.</strong> He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.</li><li><strong>Greg helped me to transition into a formal leader.</strong> I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.</li></ol><p>Louis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:</p><ol><li><strong>How to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively.</strong> You can read my “<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/branding-for-builders-19e103ef3f1d\">Branding for Builders</a>” essay to learn more.</li><li><strong>How to form successful work relationships.</strong> Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:</li></ol><ul><li>Form (get to know each other to build trust)</li><li>Storm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)</li><li>Norm (develop shared ideas and approaches)</li><li>Perform (based on shared ideas and process)</li></ul><p>I learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.</p><p>Last, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.</p><p>Upon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.</p><h3>The Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)</h3><p>The Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)</p><p>My leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”</p><p>He answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”</p><p>I laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”</p><p>The reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.</p><p>My biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.</p><h3>1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company</h3><p>After two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:</p><blockquote><em>“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we </em>finally<em> talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”</em></blockquote><p>Jonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.</p><p>That week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.</p><h3>2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup</h3><p>Keith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.</p><h3>2005: Netflix</h3><p>When I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:</p><ol><li>“Can you delight customers?”</li><li>“Can you do consumer science?”</li></ol><p>I answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:</p><ol><li><strong>Delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways.</strong> I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/intro-to-product-strategy-60bdf72b17e3\">Here’s</a> my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)</li><li><strong>The power of simplicity.</strong> One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.</li><li><strong>The balancing act of qualitative and quantitative.</strong> In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.</li><li><strong>The downside of management.</strong> Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.</li><li><strong>I learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business</strong>. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”\n(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up here.)\nGiven rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.\nTo answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:\n\nSeek high-growth companies. These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.\nBuild your network of peers and mentors. These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.\nBe ready to learn and unlearn. One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.\nWorking with humans is hard! Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.\n\nBelow, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.\n1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)\nTrip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.\nEarly at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:\n\nHow to ship a product on time. Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.\nHow to deal with imposter syndrome. Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”\n\nElectronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.\nIn my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:\n\nHere’s what you did well\nHere’s what you could have done better.\n\nMy mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.\n1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)\nGreg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:\n\nGreg forced me out of the building to connect with peers. He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.\nGreg helped me to transition into a formal leader. I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.\n\nLouis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:\n\nHow to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively. You can read my “Branding for Builders” essay to learn more.\nHow to form successful work relationships. Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:\n\nForm (get to know each other to build trust)\nStorm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)\nNorm (develop shared ideas and approaches)\nPerform (based on shared ideas and process)\n\nI learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.\nLast, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.\nUpon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.\nThe Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)\nThe Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)\nMy leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”\nHe answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”\nI laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”\nThe reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.\nMy biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.\n1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company\nAfter two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:\n“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we finally talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”\nJonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.\nThat week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.\n2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup\nKeith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.\n2005: Netflix\nWhen I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:\n\n“Can you delight customers?”\n“Can you do consumer science?”\n\nI answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:\n\nDelight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (Here’s my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)\nThe power of simplicity. One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.\nThe balancing act of qualitative and quantitative. In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.\nThe downside of management. Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.\nI learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes. The Netflix culture — its articulation of the values, skills, and behaviors desired for all employees — enabled individuals to make significant decisions without even talking to one another.\n\nLeslie Kilgore ran Marketing at Netflix. While Reed was “all in” on AB testing, Leslie helped me form the customer’s voice in my head through qualitative. Her coaching:\n\nGet outside Silicon Valley. We moved beyond “Silicon Valley Freaks” to find “normal” customers in Providence, Memphis, and Denver, among other cities.\nGet to the “why” through qualitative. Leslie often had a live video feed of focus groups playing in her cube. In a building full of “quant jocks,” it was helpful to get insight into the “why” of customer behavior by listening to our members in focus groups and usability. Leslie was an effective counter-voice to Reed.\nTest big changes. We did lots of testing of our non-member site — our site’s front door. One day Leslie looked down at a print-out of six versions going into the next AB test. In looking at the postage-stamp-sized designs, she struggled to see the differences. She remarked, “If we can’t see the deltas in each version, our customers will never notice them. Our members are way too busy to detect nuance.”\nThe dance between marketing and product. Sometimes we’d test a hypothesis for a new feature on the non-member homepage to see if it improved conversion, and if it did, we’d build the feature. In other cases, the product evolved, and we’d bring attention to a new feature on the non-member homepage later. This “Tango” between product development and marketing continued forever.\n\nThe last person at Netflix who fundamentally influenced my thinking is Patty McCord, the Chief People Officer. She helped me to solve many “people problems” in a highly leveraged way. Her advice:\nWhen presented with a problem from an employee, ask the following question: “When you talked to this person about the issue, what did he or she say.”\nIn 80% of the cases, the person would go back, talk to the other person, and solve the problem independently.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDjkQxXw-2U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Brave New Agile World</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">collaborate much more closely</a>. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/think-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"553\">product-led approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early user feedback, frequent solution validation</strong>: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/beyond-product-demo-validation-techniques-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7876\">validate our ideas</a> and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced time-to-market</strong>: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a> that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better product quality and improved adaptability</strong>: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better requirements</strong>: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\">dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work</a> and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparent development progress</strong>: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">The progress is now based on working software</a> rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved alignment</strong>: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">sprint reviews</a>. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">involving them in the process of making product decisions</a> increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivated productive teams</strong>: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Old and New Product Management Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist.

Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confusion about roles and responsibilities</strong>: Even 20 years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> was conceived, agile roles like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">product owner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.\nDuring the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.\nThis sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.\nYou can also access the content of this article on my YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brave New Agile World\nAs agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to collaborate much more closely. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a product-led approach.\nEarly user feedback, frequent solution validation: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us validate our ideas and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.\nReduced time-to-market: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as user stories that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.\nBetter product quality and improved adaptability: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.\nBetter requirements: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.\nTransparent development progress: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: The progress is now based on working software rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.\nImproved alignment: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like sprint reviews. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and involving them in the process of making product decisions increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.\nMotivated productive teams: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.\nOld and New Product Management Challenges\nWhile agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.\nLack of empowerment: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term product owner instead of product manager in order to emphasise the level of authority and empowerment a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.\nUnfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.\nConfusion about roles and responsibilities: Even 20 years after the Manifesto for Agile Software Development was conceived, agile roles like product owner and Scrum Master are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the Scrum Guide puts it.\nLack of direct interaction with users and customers: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the agile manifesto. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to empathise with the users and customers and to fully understand their needs. This, in turn, reduces the chances of offering a product that does a great job for its target audience and generates the desired business benefits.\nProduct discovery and product strategy poorly practiced: The most beautiful user stories are useless if it’s not clear who the users are and why they would want to use the product. Acquiring this information requires focused product discovery and strategy work. Unfortunately, product discovery and strategy aren’t always effectively practiced. This is not helped by the fact that agile approaches like Scrum do not offer any tools and techniques to help product owners understand if a product should be developed. Fortunately, a number of tools and techniques have emerged in recent years that help product people with their product discovery and strategy work including my product vision board and GO product roadmap.\nLack of sustainable pace: “The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely,” states the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Ironically, working at a healthy, sustainable pace can be particularly challenging in an agile context: Product people have to regularly interact with development teams in order to update the product backlog, agree on sprint goals, answer questions, and provide feedback on product increments in addition to all the other product management duties. Being overworked, however, has a negative impact on our productivity and mental health. Luckily, there are a number of practical measures you can take to achieve sustainable pace. These include not covering other people jobs on a continued basis—like acting as a stand-in Scrum Master—and having the courage to decline stakeholder requests. Please see my article “Sustainable Pace in Product Management” for more guidance.\nLooking into the Crystal Ball\nSo where do we go from here? How will product management change over the next 20 years, and which role will agile methods play—if any?\nWithout having a crystal ball at my disposal, I believe that the future of product management will be shaped by our ability to address the product management challenges mentioned above. I sincerely hope that in 20 years from now, empowerment will no longer be a significant issue, product roles will be better understood and more effectively applied, and product discovery and strategy will always be practiced by anybody who manages or owns a product.

The dev team is struggling with the current workload, and moving the date is not an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, you suspect that John’s request may be motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets. But John is a well-connected and influential individual who doesn’t like to be told that he is wrong. How can you decline his request without offending him and losing his support?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DB0ggAe7ApA?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Feel Bad about Saying<strong> </strong>No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Declining a request can be hard. You might not want to disappoint John in the example above, you might worry that saying no will anger him and lead to conflict, or you might not want to be seen as a naysayer but somebody who has a can-do attitude and wants to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying no, however, is part and parcel of a product person’s job. If you said yes to every idea and request, you would end up with a <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adrenaline-Junkies-Template-Zombies-Understanding/dp/0932633676/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">feature soup</a></em>, a product with an uncompelling value proposition and a poor user experience. As Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe, however, that it would be impossible for you to say no to John, then this may indicate that you are not properly empowered, that you lack the authority and respect required to be in charge of the product and be responsible for its success. If that’s the case, explore how you can strengthen your product leadership. Refer to my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a>&#8221; for more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empathise with the Stakeholder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having decided that you can’t accept John’s request, you might be tempted to share your view with the individual and say, for instance: “Sorry, John. But there is no way that I can add the feature to the current release. The development team is struggling to implement the agreed features, and, as you know, we can’t push out the date.” This might seem like a reasonable answer: It’s direct and it offers an explanation. But would it be effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If John does not feel heard and understood, it will be hard for him to accept no as an answer, no matter how valid your arguments are. Instead, he might feel rejected and react with disappointment or anger. He might think that you don’t appreciate his views and don’t care about his needs. Consequently, John may no longer fully trust and support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this situation and maximise the chances that John can receive a no, empathise with the individual before you offer an answer. Find out why the feature is important to John. What is his personal, vested interest in getting the feature included in the release? Why does it matter to him? Only if John feels understood will he open up to your perspective, listen to your arguments, and accept that you can’t add the feature to the release. The following <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\">listening techniques</a> will help you with this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give your full attention to the individual. Maintain eye contact and show the person that you are interested in what she or he has to say.</li><li>Keep an <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/growth-mindset-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14188\">open mind</a> even if you disagree with what you are hearing or if you dislike the individual. Listen with the intention to understand, not to answer. John might be right, after all, and you should add the feature to the release.</li><li>Pay attention to the person’s body language. Non-verbal information—like voice pitch and volume, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movement—expresses the speaker’s feelings, which help you uncover the individual’s underlying interests.</li><li>Ask clarifying and probing questions to check that you have correctly understood what was said and encourage the other person to provide more information. You might say, for instance, “Can you please help me understand why adding the feature is important to you?”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reframe the Conversati<strong>on</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">Stakeholders</a> often request specific features without necessarily being fully aware of the problem it addresses. But value is hardly created by adding a single piece of functionality—at least as long as a product is young or changing. Instead of debating an individual feature with John, reframe the conversation. Explore which user or customer problem the functionality would help address. How would implementing the feature benefit these individuals? Why do some customers view it as crucial, to stay with the example above? And would there be an alternative way to achieve the desired impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if the feature is aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goal</a> of the current development effort, the outcome you want to achieve, for example, to enter a new market or to increase engagement. Will addressing the user problem help you meet this goal and create the desired benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then you should consider adapting the development effort. You may decide to add the feature to the release, assuming that you make appropriate adjustments like reducing or removing other features or moving the delivery date. But if the answer is no, then you should decline the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Rush the Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be tempting to quickly make a decision just to be done with it. While you don’t want to procrastinate the decision, rushing it is usually a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that the conversation with John has turned difficult. He is adamant that the feature must be added, and he doesn’t want to accept your view. What’s more, he suggests that you don’t understand what the customers want, and he threatens to escalate the issue if you decline his request. In such a situation, it’s natural to feel difficult emotions like confusion, worry, and anger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, it’s best to pause the conversation and to postpone the decision to regain a cool head and allow the difficult feelings to subside. You might say to John, “It’s really important to me that we find a good solution. But I am feeling upset right now, and I need some time to reflect on what I heard you say. Let’s please continue the conversation in the afternoon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if you can and should make the decision on your own. If the decision has a bigger impact, if you require other people’s input to make the right decision, or if you want to secure their buy-in, I recommend scheduling a meeting with all the key stakeholders and the development team representatives in order to discuss and evaluate the feature request and make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">joint decision</a>. You might even find that you need to run an experiment and collect relevant data, for instance, by interviewing users or releasing a feature fake, before you can make the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try to Find Common Ground, but Don’t Split the Difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While saying no is sometimes unavoidable, I recommend that you explore if there is an alternative way to meet the stakeholder’s underlying need. Say that your suspicion turned out to be right: John’s request is, at least partly, motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets and claim a bonus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, find out if you can help him achieve his goal without having to add the feature—assuming that you believe that it is right for you to help John pursue this goal. Would it be helpful, for example, to develop a sales pitch that shows that the product addresses some of the customer needs without providing the extra feature? Or is there another solution you can develop together with John?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t make the mistake, though, to simply split the difference and suggest to John that you will partially implement the feature as part of the current release—unless this would actually meet John’s underlying need and not sacrifice sustainable pace for the development team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do what is necessary to maximise the value your product creates but don’t attempt to please individual stakeholders. Be kind and firm. Remember: Successful products are not built on weak compromises or the smallest common denominator.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-saying-no-to-stakeholders/\">5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Imagine that you are talking to John, a senior salesperson who’s been involved with the product for a while.

cancel rate from 10% to 2%. They did this by balancing delight against margin (profit) while building a durable, hard-to-copy advantage. I call it the <strong>DHM</strong> model: <strong>D</strong>elight customers in <strong>H</strong>ard-to-copy, <strong>M</strong>argin-enhancing ways.</p><p>Today, Netflix’s hard-to-copy attributes are:</p><ul><li>unique technology (personalization, streaming encoding)</li><li>network effects (a large device ecosystem)</li><li>economies of scale (a $20B annual content spend), and a</li><li>trusted brand</li></ul><p>A challenge along the way: How do you evaluate trade-offs between delight and margin? When might you choose to lose money to delight customers?</p><p>Below, I answer both of these questions using two Netflix cases, using directional data.</p><p><strong>2005: The Perfect New Release Experiment</strong></p><p>In 2005, Netflix had one million members in its nascent DVD-by-mail service. The most frequent customer request? Faster new release DVD delivery. The challenge: three months after a movie appeared in theaters, Studios released the DVD version — and as soon as that DVD version dropped, lots of customers wanted it immediately. Within a few months, however, demand decreased as the novelty wore off.</p><p>Rather than buying up a surplus of newly released DVDs to handle that short-term spike in demand, we decided to optimize for the long-term. As a result, during the first few months after a DVD launch, some customers had to wait a week or two to get the new release. If the new release wasn’t available when the customer requested it, we shipped the next movie on the customer’s movie list, then sent the new release when it became available.</p><p>In response to customer requests for faster DVD delivery, we designed a “perfect new release” A/B test and allocated 10,000 customers to the test cell. These customers received their new release DVDs the next day, while customers in the control cell waited for weeks or months to get their new releases. Our delight metric? Retention.</p><p>The questions we hoped to answer:</p><ul><li>Will faster new release DVD delivery improve retention, and, if so, by how much? (At the time, roughly 4.5% of our customers canceled each month).</li><li>If this experience improves retention, is it worth spending more money on DVD inventory? How much more?</li></ul><p>The answer: Yes, faster new release delivery improved retention, but by much less than we expected. The monthly cancel rate improved by about 0.05% — from 4.50% to 4.45%. So, was it worth spending more money on the new release DVD inventory?</p><p>Here’s how we evaluated the balance between delight and margin:</p><ul><li>If we rolled out this “perfect new release” experience to all members, we’d save 5,000 customers/year. (One million subscribers x .05 retention improvement = 5,000 saved customers).</li><li>We believed happier customers would rave about the service, attracting new members via word of mouth, so we doubled the number of saved customers. We estimated that each “saved” customer would attract one new member to the service.</li><li>The value of this perfect new release experience was $1 million: 5,000 saved customers x $100 (the lifetime value of a customer) X 2 for the WOM factor.</li></ul><p>But the cost to deliver that perfect new release experience was $5 million in additional DVD inventory. Given the potential gain of $1 million against a $5M spend, we chose not to roll the feature out to all members.</p><p>What we learned:</p><ol><li>What customers say doesn’t always match their behavior. You need A/B testing to measure behavior change.</li><li>It’s helpful to understand how much customers value different features. We invested in things our members valued (broader DVD selection, lower prices, next-day DVD delivery). We invested less in features they didn’t value (new release DVDs, social, unique movie-finding tools).</li></ol><p>We never established a more precise word-of-mouth factor, though I’ve heard that Amazon sometimes uses an 8X factor. A large WOM multiple encourages more investment in customer delight, but at the time, we couldn’t afford to spend $5 million for a marginal retention improvement.</p><p><strong>2016: The Free Trial Reminder Experiment</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fTpYyZM_pvOCBX6V\" /></figure><p>Netflix’s non-member page is the store window for the service.

When do I use this knife?”\nThese five-percenters gunk up the experience and make it harder to use. And zillions of edge cases start popping up: “Hey! Why can’t I use “Party” on devices other than my laptop?!” or “How do I execute “Party” using voice on an Amazon Show device?”\nNot All Good Ideas Benefit the Brand\nWhy won’t Netflix party? For more than two decades, Netflix has been building a product that delivers on the brand promise “Movie Enjoyment Made Easy.”\nThink for a moment about the experience of forming a Netflix Party. First, you need to choose a movie everyone likes. Then, you agree on a time to watch. Finally, you hope the experience of watching a TV show/movie with friends somehow overcomes the downsides (your friends’ lame banter and the hesitancy you had about this movie choice at this particular time).\nNetflix understands this. That’s why they give premium members the ability for family members to watch four simultaneous streams. Kristen and I can watch a movie in our bedroom, while Kelsey watches in her room, and Britney is on the living room couch. That’s “Movie Enjoyment Made Easy.” No debate about what movie to watch and when! And that’s why I think it’s unlikely that you’ll see Netflix Party implemented anytime soon.\nThanks for reading,\nGib\nGibson Biddle\ngibsonbiddle.com\nPS. Click here to give feedback on this essay.

An objective describes<em> what </em>is to be achieved. The key results state <em>how</em> we accomplish the objective. Let’s say, for example, that the objective is to “increase engagement.” The key results might then be “simplify user journey A” and “enhance feature alpha.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OKRs can be used to create cascading goals—goals that are systematically linked. This is done by using higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as the following example shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png\" alt=\"Sample Cascading OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16705\" width=\"666\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-300x71.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-768x183.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Cascading OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the key result “simplify user journey alpha” becomes an objective with two new key results, “remove user journey step two” and “improve performance by 10%” thereby connecting the two OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to note that OKRs were originally invented by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970ies to facilitate “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent execution</a>,” that is, to help people set hard, measurable goals and to be able to clearly determine if these have been met.

Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png\" alt=\"Cascading Product Management Goals\" class=\"wp-image-16704\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-768x476.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals.

A product goal, finally, helps determine the right <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision.

In the month of November, the goal is to write a 50,000-word novel. (Very quickly, you realize this averages out to 1,667 words a day for 30 days.)</p><p>When I first heard of NaNoWriMo in college, I was instantly swept by the ingenuity of the concept. I’m not one to run an actual marathon, but this felt like the mental equivalent of one: intense, but capped. Extreme yet intoxicating. It felt like stepping into a creative blizzard and emerging at the end with something tangible: the actual bones of a story.</p><blockquote>Here’s the thing: we all have stories to tell.</blockquote><p>Perspectives, parables, proposals, lessons, fantasies — they all live within us, in the dark depths of the mind’s ocean. Writing is the process of fishing these out. It’s the extraction of personal truth, bottled into little black squiggles on crisp white paper. These words help us sweep chaos into order, knit pain into opportunity, multiply the power of great ideas. They help us be known.</p><p>Entire religions, governments and innovations have been constructed from a few pieces of writing. The reading of someone else’s words is the closest thing we have to being able to occupy their mind for a few brief minutes or hours.</p><p>But your writing doesn’t have to be read by someone else for it to be worthwhile.</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of words of my earliest novels have seen no eyes but my own. The extraction process, especially during those Novembers, was sloppy. I often didn’t know what I wanted to say, or the sentences were dull, or the plot meandered like a lost child, or the characters changed histories midway through.</p><p>I failed in my dream of being a published novelist, and there were times when I wondered at all that effort — all those plot holes I tried to mend, the sentences I tried to shape, all those November nights lost in a flurry of typing — what was the point, if nobody was going to read them?</p><p>But now, more than a decade later, I reap the bountiful harvest.</p><p>What is a few hundred thousand wasted words when I have written millions more since then?</p><p>I am a product designer and manager by profession, but oh, how I write. Daily e-mails debating the pros and cons of specific product decisions; mission statements and company values; new strategies and organizational updates; promotion criteria and primers for new employees; letters to myself that turned into widely read blog that turned into a bestselling management book.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that the most important thing in writing is to <em>just get the words down — </em>the discipline of 1667 a day. The words don’t have to be good; they just have to <em>be</em>. Because once they’re down, you have something you can evolve, respond to, and polish.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that writing, reading and thinking go hand-in-hand. As my words sharpened, so did the clarity of my ideas. What used to be an amorphous haze of emotions and fragments now, more often than not, present themselves as a series of structured thoughts.</p><p>I approach reading with more depth as I consider all the choices the author made, and why. I express myself more honesty and connect better with readers. I am learning, over and over again, that writing regularly has many advantages in life.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that writing is fun when you do it for yourself. There is joy in the invention that happens on the page. There is delight in unwrapping a tiny piece of ourselves only to discover what’s behind it is universal.</p><p>For all of you doing this year’s NaNoWriMo — congratulations as you cross into the final day!

In the month of November, the goal is to write a 50,000-word novel. (Very quickly, you realize this averages out to 1,667 words a day for 30 days.)\nWhen I first heard of NaNoWriMo in college, I was instantly swept by the ingenuity of the concept. I’m not one to run an actual marathon, but this felt like the mental equivalent of one: intense, but capped. Extreme yet intoxicating. It felt like stepping into a creative blizzard and emerging at the end with something tangible: the actual bones of a story.\nHere’s the thing: we all have stories to tell.\nPerspectives, parables, proposals, lessons, fantasies — they all live within us, in the dark depths of the mind’s ocean. Writing is the process of fishing these out. It’s the extraction of personal truth, bottled into little black squiggles on crisp white paper. These words help us sweep chaos into order, knit pain into opportunity, multiply the power of great ideas. They help us be known.\nEntire religions, governments and innovations have been constructed from a few pieces of writing. The reading of someone else’s words is the closest thing we have to being able to occupy their mind for a few brief minutes or hours.\nBut your writing doesn’t have to be read by someone else for it to be worthwhile.\nThe hundreds of thousands of words of my earliest novels have seen no eyes but my own. The extraction process, especially during those Novembers, was sloppy. I often didn’t know what I wanted to say, or the sentences were dull, or the plot meandered like a lost child, or the characters changed histories midway through.\nI failed in my dream of being a published novelist, and there were times when I wondered at all that effort — all those plot holes I tried to mend, the sentences I tried to shape, all those November nights lost in a flurry of typing — what was the point, if nobody was going to read them?\nBut now, more than a decade later, I reap the bountiful harvest.\nWhat is a few hundred thousand wasted words when I have written millions more since then?\nI am a product designer and manager by profession, but oh, how I write. Daily e-mails debating the pros and cons of specific product decisions; mission statements and company values; new strategies and organizational updates; promotion criteria and primers for new employees; letters to myself that turned into widely read blog that turned into a bestselling management book.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that the most important thing in writing is to just get the words down — the discipline of 1667 a day. The words don’t have to be good; they just have to be. Because once they’re down, you have something you can evolve, respond to, and polish.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that writing, reading and thinking go hand-in-hand. As my words sharpened, so did the clarity of my ideas. What used to be an amorphous haze of emotions and fragments now, more often than not, present themselves as a series of structured thoughts.\nI approach reading with more depth as I consider all the choices the author made, and why. I express myself more honesty and connect better with readers. I am learning, over and over again, that writing regularly has many advantages in life.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that writing is fun when you do it for yourself. There is joy in the invention that happens on the page. There is delight in unwrapping a tiny piece of ourselves only to discover what’s behind it is universal.\nFor all of you doing this year’s NaNoWriMo — congratulations as you cross into the final day! The end is in sight. Looking back, I hope you’ll find the journey as rewarding as I did. And for those who aren’t, there’s always next year… or next month!

For example, a product manager might determine the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/ten-product-backlog-tips/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1301\">product backlog</a>, the development work, and the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10199\">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle, Process Oly\" class=\"wp-image-16650\" width=\"512\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png 896w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-300x259.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-768x663.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14245\">extend the product’s life cycle</a>, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">too big and heterogenous</a>, the value proposition might <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">not be compelling enough</a>, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\">Strategize</a></em>. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to &#8220;Product Strategy&#8221; in the picture above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goals</a></em>. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog</a>. Then create just enough <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready product backlog items</a> to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-scrum-cycle/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3854\">best suited to create a new product or a major product update</a>, I&#8217;ve added another little cycle between &#8220;Product Backlog&#8221; and &#8220;Product&#8221; on the picture above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release burndown chart</a>. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are <em>engagement</em>, <em>retention</em>, <em>product quality</em>, <em>team motivation</em>, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, <em>revenue</em> and <em>cost</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the KPIs and the development progress data to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">review the product strategy</a> and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\" target=\"_blank\">pivot</a>, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have now completed the cycle and started another one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Involve the Right People</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Systematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a> and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">development progress</a>, and updating the plans. Inviting people to contribute to strategic decisions makes it more likely that they understand and support them.  What’s more, this allows you to leverage their expertise, which makes it more likely that you will make the right decisions. If you work on a larger product and in a scaled environment, include the product people who work with you, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature owners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great way to engage the key stakeholders and development team members is to run a collaborative workshop, be it online or in the office. Ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or another experienced facilitator to help prepare the workshop and facilitate the session. This includes establishing ground rules, selecting a helpful <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule like consent</a>, and ensuring that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. (You can find more advice on collaborative decision-making in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Involving the stakeholder and development team members in the decision-making process puts collaboration at the centre of the strategy cycle, as the picture below shows. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-1024x880.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle\" class=\"wp-image-16641\" width=\"635\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-1024x880.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-300x258.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-768x660.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle.png 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All models are wrong, but some are useful,&#8221; as George Box once observed.

If that is not the case, then you might have to adjust the product roadmap, which might even trigger an adjustment of the product strategy. Similarly, if your product backlog experiences significant changes, as you find out, for instance, that a key feature is not required or has to be replaced, you should <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">consider the impact on the product roadmap</a> and update it as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, you should not forget to engage in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery</a>, which includes frequently monitoring new trends and the competition. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/establishing-an-effective-product-strategy-process/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14705\">As I have suggested before</a>, spend at least half a day per week carrying out continuous discovery and strategy work including reviewing relevant trends and keeping an eye on the competition.

In this article, I explain how you can use the cycle to join up product strategy, product roadmap, KPIs, product backlog, and development work, and I discuss the role stakeholders and development team members play in making effective strategic product decisions.\nThe post The Product Strategy Cycle appeared first on Roman Pichler.","guid":"https://www.romanpichler.com/?p=16635","categories":["Process: Product Discovery, Agile, Scrum","Product Vision and Strategy","product discovery","scrum","teamwork"],"isoDate":"2020-11-03T08:05:57.000Z"},{"creator":"Roman Pichler","title":"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery","link":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/","pubDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:39:03 +0000","content:encoded":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" title=\"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/clark-tibbs-oqStl2L5oxI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"something great\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h2>What is Product Discovery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Product discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> should be developed and offered. This increases the chances of creating a product that users actually want and need and achieving product success. Carrying out product discovery involves answering the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the specific value the product should create for the users and customers? What problem should it solve, or which benefit should it create?</li><li>Which market and market segment should the product address? Who are the users and who are the customers?</li><li>What makes the product stand out? How will it differ from competing offerings?</li><li>What are its business goals? How will it benefit the company? For example, generate revenue or meet a profit margin, reduce cost, or develop the brand?</li><li>What business model will it use in order to achieve the business goals, including revenue sources, cost factors, and channels?</li><li>Will the product make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-ethics/\">positive impact on people’s lives, the wider society, and the planet, or will it at least not cause any harm</a>?</li><li>How might people use the product? What are the major touch points? What kind of user experience (UX) should the product give rise to?</li><li>How can the product be built? What architecture patterns and technologies may be used?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to answer the questions above, you may want to use techniques such as direct observation, user interviews, prototyping, creating a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">strategy canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>, and you may capture some of them using a tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a>. Whatever you do, I suggest that you follow Steve Blank’s advice and “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/\" target=\"_blank\">get out of the building</a>”. Meeting users and customers, at least in form of a video call, not only helps you validate your assumptions and develop new ideas. It also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\">empathise with the individuals</a> and to better understand their perspectives and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it helpful to distinguish two types of product discovery: timeboxed and continuous discovery. Let’s look at timeboxed product discovery first.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeboxed Product Di<strong>scovery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you create a brand-new product or when you make bigger changes to an existing one, like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\">taking it to a new market</a>, you will benefit from using a dedicated, timeboxed product discovery period. This results in an innovation process like the one shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png\" alt=\"product discovery vs product development\" class=\"wp-image-16536\" width=\"561\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-300x92.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-768x234.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development.png 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, product discovery precedes product development. The former focuses on understanding if and why a product should be created or updated. The latter largely determines how the product should be developed. This includes discovering the right UX design and functionality and making the right technical decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I have purposefully drawn discovery and development as overlapping, as I find it helpful to address major UX and technical risks as part of the discovery work—without making the mistake of using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front\" target=\"_blank\">big design upfront (BDU)</a>. Addressing these risks ensures that the development team has the right knowledge to hit the ground running <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8888\">when starting development</a>. Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> and business model,</li><li>Actionable <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a> that implements the strategy,</li><li>Initial product backlog that captures the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-lean-product-backlog-variation-and-overburden/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"591\">necessary product details</a>,</li><li>A high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\">spikes</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/discovery-and-strategizing-team-1024x489.png\" alt=\"Product Discovery Team\" class=\"wp-image-14741\" width=\"555\" height=\"262\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\">understand why the product is being created or updated</a>. The latter will <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution</a>. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision</a>, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Co</strong>ntinuous Product Discovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Review the product performance using the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\">key performance indicators</a>. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?</li><li>Look for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.</li><li>Keep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate? Job postings can help you guess your competitors’ plans. Reviewing their products will tell you <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">if your product is still sufficiently differentiated</a>.</li><li>Follow the developments at your own company: Are there any changes to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/business-strategy-and-product-strategy/\">business strategy</a>? And if so, what are the consequences for your product? </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, regularly hold <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">collaborative strategy reviews</a>, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb. Assess the product strategy and product roadmap together with development team representatives and key stakeholders. These are ideally the same people who participated in the timeboxed discovery work and who helped you create the current product strategy and roadmap. As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you manage a larger product and you work in a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\">scaled environment</a>, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature and component owners or SAFe product owners</a>, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\">A Brief Guide to Product Discovery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"What is Product Discovery?\nProduct discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why a product should be developed and offered.

When I first encountered this story as a wide-eyed immigrant kid, I loved the idea that a smart, resourceful little girl could one-up the bullies. And not just kid bullies, but the the All-Powerful Adult Authority Bullies! Who doesn’t dream of that?</p><p>It wasn’t just Matilda. Looking back now, I see that so many of the stories I adored back then glorified the power of the individual. <em>You</em> could be the Chosen One. <em>You </em>could vanquish your foes, save the day, or turn a sticky situation into a happy ending. It doesn’t matter if you grew up in an orphanage or your childhood was absolutely miserable. That just made you more capable and deserving of the final rewards.</p><p>The appeal of that message is like honey when we’re small and powerless. But now that I have kids of my own, I can’t help thinking: <em>What will be the impact of Matilda’s parents treating her so poorly and then essentially abandoning her?</em></p><p>How will this affect her ability to trust others? How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?</p><p>It’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.</p><p><strong><em>“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — </em></strong>attributed to Sengcan</p><p>One of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:</p><ul><li>No situational problem-solving questions (“<em>What would do if X happened?</em>”)</li><li>No questions about my past roles (<em>“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”</em>)</li><li>No technical questions</li><li><em>Only</em> questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.</li></ul><p>I thought this was a fascinating interesting technique. I was tossed questions like <em>“What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome in your life?”</em> and <em>“Where did your drive come from?”</em> It felt as if the interviewer was trying to open my skull to discern what made me tick. Would my mindset fit in with this particular team? Would I be compelled to shoot for the same stars?</p><p>The whole thing got me wondering: what <em>does</em> make us tick? Certainly there is our genetic make-up. Any parent with multiple kids (me included) will happily talk you to sleep about how different their offspring are. My grandma likes to remind me that I was a hard-to-raise kid, the impish, rebellious sort, and my daughter got this “gene” but my son didn’t.</p><p>But increasingly, I believe much of my thinking and behavior is shaped by the thousands of circumstances outside my direct control.</p><p>What was the biggest challenge I had to overcome in my life?</p><p>How to feel like I belonged when, as a six-year-old, I boarded a plane to the United States alone to meet parents who were strangers to me.

I’m Julie Zhuo. I help companies scale and build people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a popular management book. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. The Looking Glass is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.\n\nOne glorious thing about having an almost six-year-old is that we’ve started to read some of my favorite childhood books together.\nRecently, we read Matilda by Roald Dahl. When I first encountered this story as a wide-eyed immigrant kid, I loved the idea that a smart, resourceful little girl could one-up the bullies. And not just kid bullies, but the the All-Powerful Adult Authority Bullies! Who doesn’t dream of that?\nIt wasn’t just Matilda. Looking back now, I see that so many of the stories I adored back then glorified the power of the individual. You could be the Chosen One. You could vanquish your foes, save the day, or turn a sticky situation into a happy ending. It doesn’t matter if you grew up in an orphanage or your childhood was absolutely miserable. That just made you more capable and deserving of the final rewards.\nThe appeal of that message is like honey when we’re small and powerless. But now that I have kids of my own, I can’t help thinking: What will be the impact of Matilda’s parents treating her so poorly and then essentially abandoning her?\nHow will this affect her ability to trust others? How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?\nIt’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.\n“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — attributed to Sengcan\nOne of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:\n\nNo situational problem-solving questions (“What would do if X happened?”)\nNo questions about my past roles (“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”)\nNo technical questions\nOnly questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.\n\nI thought this was a fascinating interesting technique. I was tossed questions like “What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome in your life?” and “Where did your drive come from?” It felt as if the interviewer was trying to open my skull to discern what made me tick. Would my mindset fit in with this particular team? Would I be compelled to shoot for the same stars?\nThe whole thing got me wondering: what does make us tick? Certainly there is our genetic make-up. Any parent with multiple kids (me included) will happily talk you to sleep about how different their offspring are. My grandma likes to remind me that I was a hard-to-raise kid, the impish, rebellious sort, and my daughter got this “gene” but my son didn’t.\nBut increasingly, I believe much of my thinking and behavior is shaped by the thousands of circumstances outside my direct control.\nWhat was the biggest challenge I had to overcome in my life?\nHow to feel like I belonged when, as a six-year-old, I boarded a plane to the United States alone to meet parents who were strangers to me. How to fit in when my classmates spoke of camping and tooth fairies and trampolines as they ate their PB&J while I picked at my “weird Chinese leftovers” and wondered what they meant. How to prove myself worthy of years of sacrifice.\nThis constant yearning to belong explains so much about my behavior today, in ways both big and small. It’s why I’m fanatical about celebrating traditions. You better believe I’ve got a stack of mooncakes for this week’s Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, and my kids’ Tooth Fairy writes long letters about good dental hygiene. It’s why I avoid engaging in public conflicts on Twitter and elsewhere. It’s why I’m determined to prove myself over and over again, sometimes past the point where it serves me.\nMy family runs deep in my roots as well. Every few months, I’ll realize with fresh shock that I am doing something just as my mom does, despite my deep-seated narrative that I’m SO incredibly different from her. For example, earlier this year it hit me that my default tendency is to believe there is an objective “best” path forward in any situation, which is how she sees the world. But this is not my intention. Once I recognized this, I could start to unwind the thought pattern and remind myself that often we are choosing from many fulfilling paths, or choosing the one that best matches our needs at a given moment in time. Sometimes there is simply no such thing as “objectively best.” Chance plays a huge role in specific outcomes anyway, so why not just enjoy the journey?\nUnderstand the roots, and you can understand the body. I know one person who never locks their doors because they grew up in a warm, close-knit community. I know another who is adamant about installing security features because they’ve experienced break-ins before. I know decorated former athletes who to this day are incredibly motivated by the idea of winning; I know others with losing Little League records who care far more about the players than the score.\nWhen we’ve been badly hurt by those we love, we find it difficult to trust again; when we’re repeatedly shown a vision of what “good” looks like, that influences our North Star. We treat people the way we’ve been treated. The body always keeps the score.\nSome of the explorations of one’s roots are joyful and heartwarming, some are dark. Some are best done with a trained therapist or medical professional. I am sure I will be unearthing my roots for the rest of my life, and I’m glad for it. Our past doesn’t define use, and we can always change for the better.\nBut the better I understand where I came from, the more content I become; the sharper the future seems.\nHow well do we understand our roots?\nIf I asked you to describe yourself, I bet you’d have a well-practiced answer for me. You’d tell me about your interests, your work, your childhood, your family.\nBut personal stories are complex and richly layered. My own answers to the same questions evolve year over year.

Fluff gets eroded away.\nEvery six months or so, I try to ask myself the same things:\n\nWhat kinds of people do you admire and hope to emulate? Why?\nWhat do you love about yourself? Why do you love those things?\nWhat do you dislike about yourself? Why do you think you feel that way?\nWhat do you consider the greatest challenges in your life? How did you respond?\nWhat are some recent examples of things you tried and failed at?

We can get a peek into the thoughts and lifestyles of practically anyone we’re interested in, whether they’re top epidemiologists, activists, politicians, influencers or innovators. We can find kindred spirits we’ve never met before that share our undying love of ramen and Death Note and wacky real estate listings. With just a few <em>Follows</em>, we can tumble down the rabbit hole of our curiosity.</p><p>But with this access comes a belief that just because we see more, we can also come to better conclusions about more topics — whether wearing masks is necessary, whether saying or doing X is deplorable, whether TikTok is good or bad, whether a certain executive should be fired, whether designers should code/do woodworking/wear top hats.</p><p>We’re entitled to our own opinions, of course, but in reading through so many of these debates, I find myself wondering:</p><h4><em>Is social media actually making us better informed?</em></h4><p>Here’s what it feels like sometimes: you and I are looking at a picture in the distance. We’re standing in different spots, so parts of our view are blocked.</p><p>You say: “This picture has wonderful blue sky tones.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_zLhqqEquD8tSG5J.png\" /></figure><p>And I say: “What are you talking about? There’s so much exquisite detail in these little vignettes that are totally orange!”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*erP_Rw2g_tUFVtnm.png\" /></figure><p>And a third acquaintance chimes in and says: “You’re both wrong. This picture is about dudes reading.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n6lQkKx6w9RQ6eNm.png\" /></figure><p>And some other random person on the Internet is like: “You all suck. I’m an expert, and architecture is what makes this 💯.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9XikEWm13pccTw0X.png\" /></figure><h4>Who is right?</h4><p>Well, everybody.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6fswlaSHr-3WzVh5.png\" /></figure><p>None of the observations are patently false. But the fact that we’re arguing about them is ridiculous. We’re all reporting the picture as we see it, but we each see such a small slice.</p><p>Some of us who have spent far more energy — years or decades, maybe — in understanding a thing might have have uncovered more of the picture, but even then, every perspective has blind spots.</p><p>One of my great frustrations with social media today is that it’s so hard to zoom out and gain an appreciation for the complexity of a given topic. Short, Tweet-like posts constrain observations to these micro-squares, stripping them of context and nuance. Covid hits, and suddenly it seems like everyone and their dog is an expert on how to deal with pandemics.</p><p>The problem gets even worse when you throw bad actors into the mix who intentionally lie and mislead. Now we have to deal with a bunch of voices claiming that this picture is actually about Martians and submitting false pixels as evidence.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xSSna_WGnsohipzz.png\" /></figure><p>Putting bad actors aside for a second, I suspect most posters on social media <em>are</em> describing their little view rectangles as they see it.</p><p>We may disagree on how representative that rectangle is — does a few guys holding books make <em>reading</em> the most salient theme? Is architecture really why this picture is so famous, or is it the dynamism of the figures, the noble subject matter, or the sheer scale?</p><p>But assuming the other party is stupid or dishonest or wicked for pointing out that they see blue clouds is not helping us understand the image any better. It’s just causing us to waste time and energy.</p><p>It’s why I struggle to agree or disagree with one-line takes on social media, or why I find writing short, pithy tweets exceedingly challenging. Everything that sounds like a sweet aphorism feels right in some contexts and wrong in others. Is Tiktok good or bad? Good for some, bad for others. Should a certain executive be fired? The people who know the most should judge. Should designers code? It depends on the designer and their goals.</p><p>Unfortunately, “It depends” is a dull answer. Nobody reshares “It depends.” And the long explanations summarizing centuries of critical analyses for why “The School of Athens” is such a famous painting is simply tl;dr for most of us.</p><p>Our human brain craves villains and heroes, conflicts and denouements, the entirety of a story heard and judgement rendered in the time it takes for a quarantine lunch to heat up. Is it any wonder why our communication systems have evolved to ever shorter and shorter snippets of narrative? We went from the book to the blog to the tweet; the movie to the YouTube episode to the TikTok video.</p><p>And yet, “It depends” is often the path to real wisdom. It invites more questions, leads to more of the picture being filled in. It’s not sexy, but actual learning and problem solving rarely is. It’s the spiritual sibling to all those things we rationally know are good for us but struggle to choose: the carrots over the chips; the workout shoes over the couch; meaningful time with loved ones over mindless scrolling of blue screens.</p><p><em>Is social media actually making us better informed?</em> Maybe a better question to ask is:</p><h4>How can social media systems better incentivize informedness?</h4><p>I’ll throw out a proposal: Give <strong>verified users</strong> the <strong>ability to determine</strong> if a particular post needs more <strong>factual context</strong>. If <strong>enough viewers</strong> flag something as needing more context, <strong>factual context</strong> automatically appears next to the post.</p><p>Let’s dive into this a bit more:</p><p><strong>Why verified users?</strong> Given the prevalence of bots and coordinated misinformation campaigns, why not extend identity verification beyond just advertisers and blue-check celebrities to everyone? Make it easy to create an account and get started, but if you want to grow your influence, let’s make sure you’re a real person. Imagine capping your post’s distribution or limiting your ability to send engagement signals to the system (in the form of clicks, reports, votes, etc) unless you provide identification.</p><p><strong>Why give people the ability to determine?</strong> Empowering a vast group of people to add context to content is a lot more democratic and scalable than a small, centralized body making unilateral decisions about what posts should stay up or go down. Plus, we all know the gray zone is vast. Some posts don’t violate policies but cherry-pick certain facts and omit others in ways that distort the picture. Give people the power to fill in the blanks.</p><p><strong>Why factual context?</strong> This is the fuzziest part of the proposal, because facts are notoriously tricky to define. Even if we agree on the facts (“who did what when?”), the way they are presented can favor certain interpretations over others. The proposal here is to let verified users browse a database of approved factual statements from independent fact-checkers and submit them to be included along with the original post.</p><p><strong>Why automatically trigger when enough users do this?</strong> In order for a system to feel democratic, the rules for how it works need to be transparent. The trigger could be some combination of % of users who saw the post and flagged it and total number of viewers. The more a post is seen, the more scrutiny it should receive.</p><p><strong>Why is this proposal awesome</strong>? I make no claims that this proposal is awesome. I share it because I hope to inspire critique and alternatives. This is where I throw you a heaping pile of caveats — that the proposal has holes and may be impractical and may lead to new vectors of abuse and gamification. Complexifying an already-complex system is a fool’s errand, and throwing more things in front of people doesn’t mean they’ll absorb it. But if you think this solution sucks and have a better one, share it! Or if parts of this proposal inspire new ideas, by all means build upon them.</p><h4>Is social media more good than bad?</h4><p>Depends on who you ask. The prevailing narratives, like Pokemon, have gone through so many forms already. Once, many hailed social media as the harbinger of democracy. Now, it’s blamed for the erosion of it. If you ask me, my answer is <em>Yes, social media is more good than bad</em>. Information travels today at unheard of speeds, much of it to strengthen relationships, nurture communities, spread ideas, and accelerate innovation. But the same tools also sow division, disguise truth, and enable crime. Our experiences with social media reflect the good and bad of humanity. In our lives, we’re somebody’s demon and somebody else’s angel. Still, I choose to believe that <em>we</em> are more good than bad.</p><p>And yet. Social media tools can and should improve. Between the walls of “free speech” and “make the platforms safer” lies a fertile ground of possibilities. I am reminded of a school cafeteria design I heard about once, where the problem to be solved was: “How can schools incentive healthier eating?”</p><p><em>Get rid of all those flaming hot cheetoes!</em> you might think. <em>Slap nutritional labels on everything!</em> Instead, they kept the exact same lunch options but made the unhealthy stuff harder to access. Ice cream was put behind a closed, opaque door. Water lived next to the cash register while soda hung out in a different section of the cafeteria. Plates were smaller in size.</p><p>Guess what?

Should Rick be fired? Should designers wear top hats? Also: How can social media systems better incentivize informedness?\n👋 Hi! I’m Julie Zhuo. I help companies scale and build people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a popular management book. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. The Looking Glass is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.\nOne of the great gifts of social media is the way it expands our understanding of the world.\nIt used to be that our exposure to facts and opinions came from the dozens of people we see regularly in real life — besties, those colleagues we do Taco Tuesdays with, our parents and Uncle Paul and Cousin Maria, those high-school bandmates that we see once a year — along with the handful of TV channels, books or newspapers.\nToday, thanks to social media, those dozens of opinions have become hundreds or thousands. We can get a peek into the thoughts and lifestyles of practically anyone we’re interested in, whether they’re top epidemiologists, activists, politicians, influencers or innovators. We can find kindred spirits we’ve never met before that share our undying love of ramen and Death Note and wacky real estate listings. With just a few Follows, we can tumble down the rabbit hole of our curiosity.\nBut with this access comes a belief that just because we see more, we can also come to better conclusions about more topics — whether wearing masks is necessary, whether saying or doing X is deplorable, whether TikTok is good or bad, whether a certain executive should be fired, whether designers should code/do woodworking/wear top hats.\nWe’re entitled to our own opinions, of course, but in reading through so many of these debates, I find myself wondering:\nIs social media actually making us better informed?\nHere’s what it feels like sometimes: you and I are looking at a picture in the distance. We’re standing in different spots, so parts of our view are blocked.\nYou say: “This picture has wonderful blue sky tones.”\n\nAnd I say: “What are you talking about? There’s so much exquisite detail in these little vignettes that are totally orange!”\n\nAnd a third acquaintance chimes in and says: “You’re both wrong. This picture is about dudes reading.”\n\nAnd some other random person on the Internet is like: “You all suck. I’m an expert, and architecture is what makes this 💯.”\n\nWho is right?\nWell, everybody.\n\nNone of the observations are patently false. But the fact that we’re arguing about them is ridiculous. We’re all reporting the picture as we see it, but we each see such a small slice.\nSome of us who have spent far more energy — years or decades, maybe — in understanding a thing might have have uncovered more of the picture, but even then, every perspective has blind spots.\nOne of my great frustrations with social media today is that it’s so hard to zoom out and gain an appreciation for the complexity of a given topic. Short, Tweet-like posts constrain observations to these micro-squares, stripping them of context and nuance. Covid hits, and suddenly it seems like everyone and their dog is an expert on how to deal with pandemics.\nThe problem gets even worse when you throw bad actors into the mix who intentionally lie and mislead. Now we have to deal with a bunch of voices claiming that this picture is actually about Martians and submitting false pixels as evidence.\n\nPutting bad actors aside for a second, I suspect most posters on social media are describing their little view rectangles as they see it.\nWe may disagree on how representative that rectangle is — does a few guys holding books make reading the most salient theme? Is architecture really why this picture is so famous, or is it the dynamism of the figures, the noble subject matter, or the sheer scale?\nBut assuming the other party is stupid or dishonest or wicked for pointing out that they see blue clouds is not helping us understand the image any better. It’s just causing us to waste time and energy.\nIt’s why I struggle to agree or disagree with one-line takes on social media, or why I find writing short, pithy tweets exceedingly challenging. Everything that sounds like a sweet aphorism feels right in some contexts and wrong in others. Is Tiktok good or bad? Good for some, bad for others. Should a certain executive be fired? The people who know the most should judge. Should designers code? It depends on the designer and their goals.\nUnfortunately, “It depends” is a dull answer. Nobody reshares “It depends.” And the long explanations summarizing centuries of critical analyses for why “The School of Athens” is such a famous painting is simply tl;dr for most of us.\nOur human brain craves villains and heroes, conflicts and denouements, the entirety of a story heard and judgement rendered in the time it takes for a quarantine lunch to heat up. Is it any wonder why our communication systems have evolved to ever shorter and shorter snippets of narrative? We went from the book to the blog to the tweet; the movie to the YouTube episode to the TikTok video.\nAnd yet, “It depends” is often the path to real wisdom. It invites more questions, leads to more of the picture being filled in. It’s not sexy, but actual learning and problem solving rarely is. It’s the spiritual sibling to all those things we rationally know are good for us but struggle to choose: the carrots over the chips; the workout shoes over the couch; meaningful time with loved ones over mindless scrolling of blue screens.\nIs social media actually making us better informed? Maybe a better question to ask is:\nHow can social media systems better incentivize informedness?\nI’ll throw out a proposal: Give verified users the ability to determine if a particular post needs more factual context. If enough viewers flag something as needing more context, factual context automatically appears next to the post.\nLet’s dive into this a bit more:\nWhy verified users? Given the prevalence of bots and coordinated misinformation campaigns, why not extend identity verification beyond just advertisers and blue-check celebrities to everyone? Make it easy to create an account and get started, but if you want to grow your influence, let’s make sure you’re a real person. Imagine capping your post’s distribution or limiting your ability to send engagement signals to the system (in the form of clicks, reports, votes, etc) unless you provide identification.\nWhy give people the ability to determine? Empowering a vast group of people to add context to content is a lot more democratic and scalable than a small, centralized body making unilateral decisions about what posts should stay up or go down. Plus, we all know the gray zone is vast. Some posts don’t violate policies but cherry-pick certain facts and omit others in ways that distort the picture. Give people the power to fill in the blanks.\nWhy factual context? This is the fuzziest part of the proposal, because facts are notoriously tricky to define. Even if we agree on the facts (“who did what when?”), the way they are presented can favor certain interpretations over others. The proposal here is to let verified users browse a database of approved factual statements from independent fact-checkers and submit them to be included along with the original post.\nWhy automatically trigger when enough users do this? In order for a system to feel democratic, the rules for how it works need to be transparent. The trigger could be some combination of % of users who saw the post and flagged it and total number of viewers. The more a post is seen, the more scrutiny it should receive.\nWhy is this proposal awesome? I make no claims that this proposal is awesome. I share it because I hope to inspire critique and alternatives. This is where I throw you a heaping pile of caveats — that the proposal has holes and may be impractical and may lead to new vectors of abuse and gamification. Complexifying an already-complex system is a fool’s errand, and throwing more things in front of people doesn’t mean they’ll absorb it. But if you think this solution sucks and have a better one, share it! Or if parts of this proposal inspire new ideas, by all means build upon them.\nIs social media more good than bad?\nDepends on who you ask. The prevailing narratives, like Pokemon, have gone through so many forms already. Once, many hailed social media as the harbinger of democracy. Now, it’s blamed for the erosion of it. If you ask me, my answer is Yes, social media is more good than bad. Information travels today at unheard of speeds, much of it to strengthen relationships, nurture communities, spread ideas, and accelerate innovation. But the same tools also sow division, disguise truth, and enable crime. Our experiences with social media reflect the good and bad of humanity. In our lives, we’re somebody’s demon and somebody else’s angel. Still, I choose to believe that we are more good than bad.\nAnd yet. Social media tools can and should improve. Between the walls of “free speech” and “make the platforms safer” lies a fertile ground of possibilities. I am reminded of a school cafeteria design I heard about once, where the problem to be solved was: “How can schools incentive healthier eating?”\nGet rid of all those flaming hot cheetoes! you might think. Slap nutritional labels on everything! Instead, they kept the exact same lunch options but made the unhealthy stuff harder to access. Ice cream was put behind a closed, opaque door. Water lived next to the cash register while soda hung out in a different section of the cafeteria. Plates were smaller in size.\nGuess what? Kids ate better.\nWhat could we design to better incentive informedness? How can we make it easier to pursue the truth in wonderful collaborative fashion, as Raphael imagined in his masterpiece fresco?\nThere’s work to be done. I’m looking forward to the next chapter.","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ef227e726e5e","isoDate":"2020-09-02T14:30:40.000Z"},{"creator":"Roman Pichler","title":"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important","link":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 08:19:45 +0000","content:encoded":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/\" title=\"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrishna-flickr-e1590504925764-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ducks in a row\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h2>Step 1: Ensure that you know who the product is for and why people will want to use it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll never forget the day when I suggested to the product manager of a brand-new healthcare product to prioritise its features. The individual looked at me slightly bewildered and replied, &#8220;I can’t. They are all high-priority.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritisation requires deciding how important an item is. If everything is high priority, everything is equally important. This means in effect that nothing is a priority. But without clear priorities, the development team lacks direction, and there is only a slim chance of creating a successful product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common root cause of not being able to prioritise a product backlog is a lack of understanding of who the users of the product are and what specific value it should create for them. I find it not uncommon that features are added to the product backlog because a senior <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholder</a> demands it (HIPPO syndrome) or someone thinks it is a good idea (“let’s brainstorm some <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a>”). But <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> exists to generate value for the users and for the company providing it. If it is not clear who the users are and why they would want to interact with the product, it will be hard to decide which items should be in the product backlog and how important they are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate the risk of adding the wrong items to the product backlog, ensure that you have a validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> in place, no matter if you look after a brand-new or as an existing product. Such a strategy should clearly state the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The users and customers of the product so that it is clear who will benefit from it and who won’t;</li><li>The main problem the product should address or the primary benefit it should offer, or the main goal users will want to achieve with it;</li><li>The three to five features that will make it stand out from the crowd;</li><li>The specific benefits it should create for the business.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at a brief example and say that I want to create a product that helps people eat healthily. Then I could choose to address middle aged men who suffer from unhealthy eating habits and who don’t exercise enough. The benefit might be to reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The standout features might be to measure food sugar levels, analyse the user’s eating habits, and integrate with leading smart scales. The business goals, finally, might be to diversify my company and open up a new revenue stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you should be confident that your strategy is correct, and you should have data to support your view. In other words, you should have addressed the key assumptions and risks in the product strategy, and you should have carried out the necessary validation work. A tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a> helps you capture and validate your product strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Describe the outcome or benefit the product should create in the next few months</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a product strategy in place is great, but it is not enough to effectively prioritise a product backlog. What’s required is a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\">product goal</a> that is connected to the strategy and creates the right context to decide which backlog items are more important and which ones are less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create such a goal, ask yourself which outcome or benefit your product should achieve in the next, say, three to six months. What are the desired user and business benefits you want to create? Make sure that this goal is in line with the product strategy and that it helps create the desired user and business benefits. An example based on the sample strategy above would be &#8220;help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.&#8221; (Note that I have chosen a compound goal that captures the desired user and business benefits.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to take this idea further, derive several product goals from the product strategy for the next 12 months, and capture them on a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a>. This puts the goal chosen in context and communicates how the product is likely to evolve over a longer period. If you have a product roadmap, then ensure that it implements the overall product strategy. Consider reworking it so that it clearly states the desired outcomes your product should achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Remove all items from the product backlog that do not support the desired outcome</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, use the product goal you have chosen to delete all items from the product backlog that do not serve it. While this approach might sound radical, it ensures that your backlog becomes concise and focused. It avoids having items on the backlog that are speculative and may not create value, and maybe even more importantly, it facilitates prioritisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe that removing the product backlog items is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, then this may indicate that you lack the necessary <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">empowerment</a> and/or that the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\">stakeholders</a> do not buy into the overall product strategy and the specific product goal you have chosen. Involving the individuals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">decision-making process</a> can help address both issues. This allows the stakeholders to voice their ideas and concerns, and it makes it more likely that they understand and support important product decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to decide together with the stakeholders, then invite them to a meeting. Carefully prepare the session and choose a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule</a>, for instance, consent. Additionally, ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or another skilled facilitator to help run the meeting so that everyone is heard, and nobody dominates. (I offer more advice on securing stakeholder buy-in and decision-making in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Prioritise the remaining product backlog items</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now prioritise the remaining product backlog items. I recommend that you prioritise a new or significantly changed product backlog initially by risk, taking into account the user, technology, and business-related risks. Assess all backlog items together with the development team and move those to the top that carry the highest risk. This approach <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leveraging-failure-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13630\">accelerates learning</a> and it avoids failing late when there are less options to change course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, ensure that the high-priority items are &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>&#8220;, that the development team and you have a shared understanding of them, that the team can implement them in the next sprint, and that they are testable.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering what was up with the healthcare product I mentioned earlier.

Additionally, such a vision is hardly inspiring. A good vision exercises pull—it describes a future state that people want to bring about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong>: A confusion about what an effective product vision is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Describe the ultimate purpose of your product, the positive change the product should bring about like “healthy eating”. Think of the vision as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html\" target=\"_blank\">big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)</a> that inspires people and offers a continuity of purpose for the next five to ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\">8 Tips for Creating A Compelling Product Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Target Group is (too) Big and Heterogenous</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Everyone who owns a smartphone”, “Business users and consumers”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A very big and diverse target group makes it hard to formulate a crisp, compelling value proposition and strong standout features. It can also result in a large product backlog and high development cost: The greater the number of people who should benefit from your product is, the more diverse their needs are likely to be, and the more features are usually required to address them. Trying to offer a product that pleases everybody carries the risk of not doing a good job for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: A lack of understanding of users and their needs, lack of empowerment of the person in charge of the product, inappropriate growth strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Successful products are not built by agreeing on the smallest common denominator or trying to please powerful stakeholders. Instead, they require tough strategic decision and clear focus. Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank suggested</a>, particularly when you manage a new or young product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams</a>: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/market-segmentation-tips-for-product-managers/\">Market Segmentation Tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 59; <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 36.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor. Consequently, it will be hard to achieve the desired business benefits and monetise the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of understanding what problems users really face and what they really need; a target group that is too large and heterogenous, as discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the main reason for people to use the product, the primary benefit that the product should offer to the users or the main problem it should address. Another approach is to identify the main goal users will want to achieve by using the product or to find the primary job the product should do for them. Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order get to know the users, empathise with the individuals, and develop a thorough understanding of their needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 94, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs are Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy to use, calorie counter, works on iOS and Android”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When features—in the sense of product capabilities—are mistaken for needs, it is not clear why people should use the product, and the offering is likely to suffer from having a poor, unconvincing value proposition. Additionally, there is too much focus on the solution (“solutionising”), which is likely to limit the development team’s ability to come up with the best possible design and architecture options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Confusion about what a need is; a lack of understanding of the user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the <em>why</em>: Ask why people would want to use the product. What specific benefit will it offer, or which problem will it help solve? Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews. Additionally, describe the needs from the users’ perspective, for example, “help me achieve a healthy target weight” or “help me significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">What is a Digital Product: Section “Features and Components”</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs Statement is not Specific</strong> Enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Get fit&#8221;, &#8220;Feel better&#8221;, &#8220;Improve eating habits”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: It’s perfectly fine to start out with a broad needs statement.

Iterate over the product vision board and refine its contents, similar to how you would refine the product backlog and break bigger items into more specific ones. For instance, if getting fit is the desired benefit, then a refined and more specific needs statement might be “be able to run 10k”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 66.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>No Convincing Standout Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy-to-use user interface, calorie intake, barcode scanner”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Standout features ensure that your product is effectively differentiated: As their name suggests, they make your product stand out from the crowd, they give people a reason to choose it over competing offerings. If the features are weak, it will not be clear to prospective users why they should favour your product over alternatives, and it will be hard to market and sell the offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of market insight, lack of empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: To address the first cause, perform competitor research and apply a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">Strategy Canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>.

I’m the author of a </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567\"><em>popular management book</em></a><em>. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. </em><strong><em>The Looking Glass</em></strong><em> is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5_Xv5q_WfIXdhkIN.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Once upon a time, I received an important email in my inbox that alerted me to some distressing news.</p><p>Every six months, our company ran a wide-scale anonymous satisfaction survey that pretty much every single employee answered. If your team was big enough, you’d get your own breakout of the results for how your immediate team was feeling. I always looked forward to diving in and seeing what was going well and what wasn’t.</p><p>As my eyes scanned the various questions, graphs, and answers, one result in particular stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>Under the question “How often does your manager show care for you?” the chart that displayed the responses from my team was a mass of red. I had to read it a few times to ensure I wasn’t misunderstanding: <em>the majority of my team thought I didn’t show care for them?!</em></p><p>This was hard to process because of course I cared. I cared a lot! I took pride in helping my reports grow and thrive. I gave them challenging projects and frequent feedback because I wanted to see them succeed. And if there were ways in which I could help them — by hiring for their team, advocating for issues on their behalf, or pitching in on a tough project — I always showed up. How could they possibly think that I didn’t care?!</p><p>That night, I met a manager friend for dinner and poured my heart out to him. He listened and then gave me a diagnosis. “Julie,” he said, “Have you ever told your reports that you care about them? Or asked them how they’d like to be cared for?”</p><p>I searched my memories and came up short. He had a point. “Everyone’s wired differently,” he said. “So sometimes we struggle to understand each other. Maybe the way you show care and the way your reports perceive care are different. Everyone has their own preferences for how they like to operate and be treated.”</p><p>He was absolutely right. I took the feedback to better understand what “being cared for” meant to my reports. And I would learn this lesson time and time again — that even if you’re a good, experienced manager, even if you show up to work every day with confidence, you’re still going to fail to connect with others from time to time. You’ll still have misunderstandings or talk past each other.</p><p>Some of this will be due to cultural differences, or contrasting personalities, or because we simply have different perspectives and life experiences. Whatever the source, the more I understood about what mattered to my the people I worked with, the better of a colleague and manager I’d be. Similarly, the more my colleagues understood about how <em>I</em> worked, the fewer misunderstandings we’d have.</p><p>That’s where the exercise of creating a user manual comes in.</p><h4>A User Guide for You</h4><p>I started writing a “How to work with Julie” guide for my team about three or four years ago, and heard the phrase <em>User Guide</em> some time later. Instantly it stuck with me. When you buy a new camera, it comes with a little booklet that teaches you about the specifics of the gadget — what each button means, how to select the appropriate lighting, how to review the images.</p><p>A User Guide for a Person works in a similar way. It creates clarity on how you work — what you value, how you look at problems, what your blind spots or areas of growth are, and how to build trust with you.</p><p>It’s something you can give to your manager, the folks you work the closest with, or — if you are a manager — every new report who joins your team.</p><p>The key to a good User Guide is to make it as <em>specific to you as possible</em> (<a href=\"https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-candidates-companies\">check out this post on why that matters</a>). Leave out the generic fluff that everyone would agree with, like “<em>I get motivated when my work has impact.</em>” That doesn’t tell us anything, except that you’re not a cat. Can you be more specific and tell us what <em>kind</em> of impact is motivating to you (and what kind isn’t?)</p><p>The most effective User Guides contain snippets that might make you feel vulnerable, like you’re letting the team see you unplugged, in your PJs with rumpled hair. But vulnerability is the secret ingredient to trust. When you acknowledge your imperfections, you will receive far more rewards in the form of support, mentorship, and empathy. And you invite others to be more open with you as well.</p><p>I’ve included a User Guide template and my personal example as a starting point — feel free to modify to best suit your needs. Mine has been a living document over the years, honed through continual feedback that has shined new light on how I understand myself and my relationships. I hope yours gives you a similar gift.</p><p>Happy team-working!</p><h4><strong>Template: A User Guide To Working With &lt;Your Name&gt;</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://coda.io/@joulee/meet-julie\"><em>Use this template on Coda.io</em></a></p><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p><em>Why are you writing this user guide?

And I’m excited for all we’ll learn from each other! I already have high expectations that our collaboration together will yield some wonderful things :) That said, we are unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences and styles for how we like to work.</p><p>I’m writing this user guide to give you a better handle on me and my values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible. I encourage you to do the same and share your user guide with me as well!</p><h4><strong>How I view success</strong></h4><ul><li>A manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for her team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are people — hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; purpose — clarity on what success looks like; and process — clarity on how to best work. Of these three levers, I believe people is the most important.</li><li>Success is constantly learning and getting better. We can’t always control the results, and if we aim high we will sometimes fail. But no matter the outcome, there are always lessons to be mined. Those learnings are ours to keep forever.</li><li>The path to success matters as much as the outcome. Everyone gets lucky and unlucky sometimes. But if we’re good, our success will be sustainable because it’s our process that works.</li><li>It’s better to set ambitious goals that we don’t always meet, than to sell ourselves short.</li><li>We can always do and be better.</li><li>Success without integrity is like a car without an engine.</li></ul><h4><strong>How I communicate</strong></h4><ul><li>I am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk my thoughts out loud which can feel rambling. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or to be precise with action items.</li><li>Because a lot of my job is nurturing creativity, my preference is for others to come to the right solution with their own conviction, not to tell others what I think the right solution is. However, I recognize that sometimes the most pragmatic and efficient thing is to be clear with my opinion early on so we can resolve major misalignments. If I am not being clear and you worry we may not be seeing eye to eye, please let me know.</li><li>I like to be engaged in conversations and presentations and show respect to the speaker. I will often smile and nod along to encourage the speaker. It doesn’t mean I agree with everything that is being said.</li><li>I am continually working on being more direct, especially about concerns or things I don’t think are going well. I commit to giving you frequent feedback or suggestions that I think may help you. If it doesn’t feel like I am being direct enough, or if my feedback is not helpful, please let me know.</li><li>I place a lot of value on having a clear big-picture narrative and being able to to speak to the meaning behind the work, as well as what’s exciting about it. If you aren’t sure why we are working on something, please let me know.</li><li>I prefer email for asynchronous team communication. Please use email if you’re describing an issue with a good deal with context. I respond to most things within 2 work days, so if I’ve been slow, re-ping me as I do sometimes miss things. If something is urgent or easy to respond to, feel free to message me over chat, and allow me the rest of the day to respond.</li><li>If you feel something is better discussed with me in person, don’t hesitate to drop a note with what you’d like to talk about. If you are a direct report, I will try my best to move things around so we can meet as soon as possible — it’s extremely important to me that you feel you always have time when you need it. If you are not a direct report but I can be of help to you, then we’ll schedule time during the next available office hours block. Occasionally, I’ll lack the necessary context to be useful, and in those cases I will decline the meeting and suggest another person who would be better able to assist you.</li></ul><h4><strong>Things I do that may annoy you</strong></h4><ul><li>I am that archetype of the “high expectations Asian parent,” so I can seem demanding, critical, and never satisfied rather than supportive, encouraging, or empathetic. Since then, I’ve come to learn that different people respond better to different styles. Please know that I am always in your corner, and I care about you, even as I work on showing that better.</li><li>I am on the hyper-rational end of the emotional spectrum. This can be annoying when you share a problem or feeling with me, and I respond with a bunch of rationalized suggestions, when what the situation called for was listening and empathy. I am working on being better attuned to this.</li><li>I am generally more focused on inputs than outputs. This means that if there is a positive outcome, but the process in getting there didn’t seem sound or intentional to me, I might not see it as cause for celebration. This can be frustrating if you are more focused on outputs than inputs.</li><li>I am frequently late to meetings, like 1–5 minutes late. Sometimes there is a good reason, but 80% of the time, the reason is that I suck at punctuality, and need to get better at it. You should call me out when this happens.</li><li>I can fall into the bias of assuming everyone has the same context as I do, and as a result, not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly or as broadly as I should. Please remind me to provide more context if I do this.</li><li>Being a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics quickly, or who want to commit to plans and not change them.</li><li>Because I have a tendency to think long-term, I might give you impractical or complex suggestions when what you’re looking for is pragmatic, short-term options. Please remind me of the problem context if you feel my feedback is unhelpful or if you observe that I am trying to boil the ocean.</li><li>I’m optimistic and see the best in others, and sometimes that may strike you as naive or unrealistic when I’m convinced a tough situation can be fixed with greater effort versus a structural change.</li></ul><h4><strong>What gains and loses my trust</strong></h4><ul><li>The easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback — whether about a piece of design work, a project proposal, or their own behavior — and use it to improve. Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.</li><li>Another thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.</li><li>I appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.</li><li>I build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.</li><li>If you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.</li><li>If I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.</li><li>It’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.</li></ul><h4><strong>My strengths</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Strong relationships</strong>. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.</li><li><strong>Staying calm, collected, and optimistic</strong>. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong>. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.</li><li><strong>Thoughtful intentionality</strong>: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.</li></ul><h4><strong>My growth areas</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Directness and simplicity in communication</strong>: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.</li><li><strong>Execution/follow-through</strong>: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.</li><li><strong>Meta-prioritization</strong>: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.</li><li><strong>Expanding domains of knowledge</strong>: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.</li><li><strong>Storytelling</strong>: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.</li></ul><p><em>Image by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/miemo/\"><em>Miemo Penttinen</em></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b8ee547a79e9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","content:encodedSnippet":"What makes you tick?

Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.\nAnother thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.\nI appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.\nI build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.\nIf you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.\nIf I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.\nIt’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.\n\nMy strengths\n\nStrong relationships. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.\nStaying calm, collected, and optimistic. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.\nLong-term focus. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.\nThoughtful intentionality: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.\n\nMy growth areas\n\nDirectness and simplicity in communication: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.\nExecution/follow-through: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.\nMeta-prioritization: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.\nExpanding domains of knowledge: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.\nStorytelling: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.\n\nImage by Miemo Penttinen","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/b8ee547a79e9","isoDate":"2020-08-07T14:30:36.000Z"},{"creator":"Julie Zhuo","title":"Seven Reminders about Racism","link":"https://joulee.medium.com/seven-reminders-about-racism-b1b3e20d018?source=rss-b8a4e5ae7490------2","pubDate":"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 14:30:43 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person.

We’ve been socialized to think of “those racists” as morally horrible, so we want to avoid being labelled <em>racist</em> at any cost. But this cost is astronomically high: we’ve been living under a veil of ignorance that whispers: <em>“Good” people (such as ourselves!) are not racists</em>. Therefore, we don’t talk about racism. We don’t talk about racism <em>so much</em> that it feels uncomfortable to bring up race up at all. But you can’t fix a problem if you don’t talk about it.</li><li>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person. It means you’ve said or done things that perpetuate systems benefitting certain races — <em>your race</em> — at the expense of others. Instead of hearing <em>You said something racist</em> as <em>You just called me a shitty person</em>, we need to retrain ourselves to hear it as we would any other useful criticism — <em>Your statement had a negative impact on X person or group</em>. If you’re embarrassed about having that kind of negative impact, great! It means you care to do better (and are not a morally horrible person. )</li><li>The vast majority of conflicts are two-way streets, where each side can easily point out something the other side did that “wasn’t right.” For example, Person A calls Person B out for saying something racist, and Person B calls out Person A for saying it in an attacking manner. If you are Person C seeking to be a neutral mediator, you may think that both sides make reasonable points and could stand to improve by listening to the other. That seems fair, right? Well, only if Person B and Person A are in relatively equal positions of power. However, if they are not, <em>the person with greater power in the scenario holds greater responsibility to resolve (rather than escalate) the conflict.</em> If tensions escalate between a manager and her report, who would you expect to stay calm and collected? If a child and their parent both say “You’re awful” in a moment of anger to one another, who do you think needs to apologize first?</li><li>People with power often don’t recognize the power they have, especially if it’s afforded by the color of their skin. We tend to think of ourselves as “normal people,” “human, just like everyone else.” This is not wrong. None of us are exempt from joy, suffering, pain, fear, self-loathing, and the entire spectrum of the human condition. We all have moments when we feel trapped or suffocated by those who hold power over us. At the same time, <em>all</em> of us will be in contexts where we have more power than someone else. Some folks are in that position far more often due to the color of their skin (whiter), their gender (male), or their economic status (wealthier). Reflecting on your power is similar to the exercise of giving thanks: there is always something to be grateful for in your life (that somebody else doesn’t have); there is always something you have more power to change than somebody else.</li><li>Privilege is all the good stuff you get that others don’t because of the circumstances of your birth. Power is your ability to influence how the rules of our man-made society work. Both are hard to see in the same way that air is hard to see — you don’t notice it until there’s not enough. Black and Brown people have felt this lack for a long, long time. It started 400 years ago when they were enslaved, killed and treated as “less than” human. This lack continues today. Compared to a White or Asian person, it’s harder for them to be trusted, to be hired, to borrow money, to be believed, to be celebrated, to be in positions of power, or to be seen. We need to seek out, listen to and understand the stories of groups with less power and privilege to truly appreciate what we do have, and how we can apply that towards a more just society.</li><li>When someone calls you out for saying or doing something racist, your response can be very simple: 1) thank them for bringing it to your attention 2) apologize for the hurt you caused 3) commit to reflecting and improving. Thank them because feedback is a gift that will make your future self better. Apologize because you choose to believe people when they tell you they are hurt. Apologize even if your intentions were good, because good intentions don’t negate the negative impact of your actions. (You still say <em>Sorry</em> when you accidentally bump into someone, don’t you?) Reflect and strive for better because even if you don’t think you did anything wrong in that moment, you will likely find lessons to take away upon further processing. If you have feedback about how the other person’s message could have been better delivered, now’s not the time to share because it’s probably coming from a place of defensiveness. Save it for when you’ve built trust with that person and can share it with <em>their</em> best intentions in mind.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to acknowledge, talk about, and act on race and racism. You will make mistakes and say the wrong things. But that’s true for anything worthwhile in life. At the end of the day, actions matter. What can you do with your power?

In his article, he cites research from Google that suggests <strong>psychological safety is the most predictive characteristic of successful teams</strong>. As a minority working in tech, this article brought to mind a pressing question: given the lack of diversity in tech, how can tech workers foster a psychologically-safe environment for minorities, many of whom struggle just to be their true selves at work? For me, it starts with empathy.</p><p>Have you ever spent time in a place where you’re in the minority, even briefly? At an event, for example, or in another country? Think about how you felt being the only man at an event attended primarily by women, or the only white person in an entire train station in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. If you have never experienced this, try it. <strong>The feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, is what many minorities experience in the workplace on a regular basis.</strong></p><p>Until recently in my career, I was always the only black person on my team. Coworkers have generally been nice to me, but it’s hard to ignore that I’m <em>noticeably</em> different when no one else at work looks like I do. I’ve learned to ignore this feeling of being an outsider, but it always comes back eventually, whether it’s during meetings with executive leadership, while walking into a company’s office for an onsite interview, or in other work-related situations.</p><p>Perhaps you know some minorities who don’t seem to experience that feeling, and perhaps they don’t, especially when they feel successful in their career. I know minorities who’ve reached a point where they no longer give a damn about what others think or they’ve learned to cope with the status quo.</p><blockquote><em>But many minorities spend a significant amount of cognitive energy trying to belong instead of performing our best work and it’s exhausting.</em></blockquote><p>One thing I’ve come to realize is how hard it is for people to share these experiences. Often, these stories are too personal, emotional, subjective, or hard to share without deeply trusting the listener. It is also difficult to share these stories, as without the larger context, the listener is unlikely to grasp the nuances of the experience without knowing the backstory.</p><p>In general, many minorities choose not to speak up because they don’t want to jeopardize their careers, be disliked, feel like victims, or because their opinions have been ignored in the past. Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and ‘otherness’ that they experience, it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically, true to themselves, or thrive.</p><p>Although there has been more and more discussion about the lack of diversity in tech, I believe there is still a startling empathy gap as most people do not realize the sheer amount of energy minorities expend trying to belong.

In his article, he cites research from Google that suggests psychological safety is the most predictive characteristic of successful teams. As a minority working in tech, this article brought to mind a pressing question: given the lack of diversity in tech, how can tech workers foster a psychologically-safe environment for minorities, many of whom struggle just to be their true selves at work? For me, it starts with empathy.\nHave you ever spent time in a place where you’re in the minority, even briefly? At an event, for example, or in another country? Think about how you felt being the only man at an event attended primarily by women, or the only white person in an entire train station in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. If you have never experienced this, try it. The feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, is what many minorities experience in the workplace on a regular basis.\nUntil recently in my career, I was always the only black person on my team. Coworkers have generally been nice to me, but it’s hard to ignore that I’m noticeably different when no one else at work looks like I do. I’ve learned to ignore this feeling of being an outsider, but it always comes back eventually, whether it’s during meetings with executive leadership, while walking into a company’s office for an onsite interview, or in other work-related situations.\nPerhaps you know some minorities who don’t seem to experience that feeling, and perhaps they don’t, especially when they feel successful in their career. I know minorities who’ve reached a point where they no longer give a damn about what others think or they’ve learned to cope with the status quo.\nBut many minorities spend a significant amount of cognitive energy trying to belong instead of performing our best work and it’s exhausting.\nOne thing I’ve come to realize is how hard it is for people to share these experiences. Often, these stories are too personal, emotional, subjective, or hard to share without deeply trusting the listener. It is also difficult to share these stories, as without the larger context, the listener is unlikely to grasp the nuances of the experience without knowing the backstory.\nIn general, many minorities choose not to speak up because they don’t want to jeopardize their careers, be disliked, feel like victims, or because their opinions have been ignored in the past. Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and ‘otherness’ that they experience, it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically, true to themselves, or thrive.\nAlthough there has been more and more discussion about the lack of diversity in tech, I believe there is still a startling empathy gap as most people do not realize the sheer amount of energy minorities expend trying to belong. The ideal solution is simply to have companies that are diverse, so that no one feels out of place and everyone can thrive.\nAs a first step, our white, male-dominated industry needs to recognize the real struggle that underrepresented groups face and start driving conversations and actions to create a more empathetic and inclusive workplace. Without such empathy, most companies will continue to fail to achieve true organizational buy-in and won’t be able to take the necessary actions to attract, retain, or get the best work from people who come from underrepresented backgrounds. We can all contribute to finding solutions, but many people in tech don’t bother looking for those solutions because they fail to see the problem in the first place.\n(Thanks to Dan Sherizen and Leah Reich for reviewing earlier drafts)\n\nDiversity in Tech: The Unspoken Empathy Gap was originally published in Tech Diversity Files on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Jules Walter","guid":"https://medium.com/p/5b806c83d717","categories":["silicon-valley","diversity","tech"],"isoDate":"2016-06-06T16:25:38.000Z"},{"creator":"Jules Walter","title":"Teaching Coding Skills in Developing Countries","link":"https://medium.com/the-re-education/teaching-coding-skills-in-developing-countries-dc1df479257d?source=rss-eec997506378------2","pubDate":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 02:25:57 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>What I Learned Leading a Programming Bootcamp in Haiti</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WgkYM5R-BNe0mdV_7eskBQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Teacher (center) and students in the class</figcaption></figure><p>This spring I enrolled in a CodePath mobile development course.

One of the more challenging aspects of learning to code is the willingness to put in the hours it takes to attain proficiency.
