Metrics, Maker-User-Gap—Food for Agile Thought #293</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to the 293rd edition of the Food for Agile Thought newsletter, shared with 31,307 peers. This week, we delve into why picking success metrics is so challenging yet critical, and Henrik Kniberg shares some vital insights after years of working with Spotify, LEGO, and Minecraft development. Also, we point at how sociotechnical architecture and systems thinking are key to enabling product thinking in organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then share an eight-step strategy workshop; we understand why ‘going deep’ is Stripe’s core product principle, and we wonder why some product managers hold on to timeline-based planning while product roadmaps have evolved so rapidly in recent years. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we analyze the idea of ‘autonomy’ in the workplace, particularly regarding two challenges: the air sandwich and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #293: Success Metrics, Maker-User-Gap, Strategy and Outcomes, Stakeholder Map Templates — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65970\" data-wp-pid=\"65970\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics-825x413.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-293-success-metrics-800x400.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65968\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-292-bottom-agile/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #292: The Bottom of Agile, Efficiency is the Enemy, Nijute to Solve Impossible Problems, The Velocity Forecasting Spreadsheet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #292</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Smartphones are quintessentially personal devices, and hence mobile apps can play a significant role in personalizing customer communication to a great extent.</p><p>By utilizing a mobile app, even small enterprises across the niches enjoy the opportunity to drive customer engagement and create strong bonds. The Indian small business sector is more evident as mobile apps are helping the so-called brick-and-mortar stores compete with big brands with a personalized experience.</p><p>Small business mobile app development India focuses on certain features, and user experience attributes push this personalization drive. For example, the use of personalized push notifications helps small enterprises connect customers easily with the right message and at the right time.</p><p>The personalized user experience can be augmented by utilizing the users’ data and location data to unleash mobile promotions, roll out new features, and create a better user experience.</p><h3><strong>Lead generation and Business Conversion</strong></h3><p>Lead generation and steady business conversion happen to be the two most important benefits of mobile apps for small businesses. Many small businesses that have limited scope in interacting directly with customers find mobile apps and social media channels as an effective medium to generate business leads.</p><p>Hyperlocal and highly context-aware marketing of services and products through mobile apps can easily push lead generation and increase business conversion. In addition, thanks to the powerful location-sensing technologies used by today’s mobile apps and because of the scope of using data-driven insights, mobile apps can play a great role in engaging customers based on their location and the specific user context.</p><p>A retail business now can easily facilitate omnichannel targeting of customers with the mobile apps playing the central role in coordinating with different channels. For instance, a mobile app for a retail brand can sync the customer experience and buying process between the online store and the physical store. You scan a product while window shopping, get informed about the product through the mobile app and make the purchase order from mobile.</p><h3><strong>Helping with Operational Ease and Cost-Saving</strong></h3><p>Mobile apps can get things done in a whizz when communicating with customers, solving their issues and providing customers what they want. Operational efficiency is a key reason for many small businesses to embrace mobile apps.</p><p>Companies relying heavily on the field staff can benefit tremendously from mobile apps. From monitoring the field staff in real-time to collaborating on service-related issues, mobile apps in more than one way can ensure operational ease in companies depending on field service or field professionals.</p><p>Thanks to real-time collaboration and the capability to track employees and tasks through mobile apps, businesses can also make considerable cost savings for operational tasks. Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.</p><h3><strong>Taking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps</strong></h3><p>With the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches. So today, you have doorstep food delivery apps, an on-demand app for barbers and beauticians, apps for housemaid services and apps for almost everything that can cater to on-demand needs.</p><p>The best thing about on-demand apps is that you don’t need to start a completely new business catering to the demands of the customers registered through a mobile app. You can either just turn your good old website or the existing mobile app into an on-demand app to cater to more customers, or you can just register with an aggregator or marketplace app and allow customers to buy your services or products through that app.</p><p>When it comes to in-demand apps, the sky’s the limit for a small business to prosper. For example, suppose you are a local grocery shop with a limited clientele. In that case, you can just build your grocery delivery app and offer doorstep delivery services throughout the whole city and even beyond the city limits.</p><p>On-demand <strong>app development in India</strong> is on the rise, thanks to the overwhelming number of unique services and solutions these apps are providing. For example, an app offering tattoo and body graffiti artists services in every city area can just be availed by the people and artist professionals alike.</p><h3><strong>Enhancing Customer Loyalty</strong></h3><p>A mobile app, unlike a website, doesn’t get lost in the clamour and noise of the web. It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often. But a customer using your app knows your brand more personal and is likely to interact with your brand quite often.</p><p>The mobile app can help retain users with more certainty than any other digital interface. The personalized push notifications, customer-centric value creation through loyalty programs and special offers can help boost customer footfall and brand loyalty. Mobile apps can be the right tool in the measures for customer loyalty enhancement.</p><h3><strong>Data-driven Decision Making</strong></h3><p>These days even small businesses understand the value of data and data-driven insights in the decision-making and strategy-building processes. This is where mobile apps play a very crucial role. Mobile apps help a business capture various customer data referring to locations, preferences, online user behavior, taste and choices and other factors. This huge pool of customer data can help a business make decisions affecting sales and business conversion positively.</p><p>From capturing the customer’s demographic data to knowing the exact location of the customers to understanding the actual context and situation of the customers, mobile apps can help a business with potential data inputs in numerous ways. For example, depending upon the time, season, urgency and other data, a customer can be approached at the right time that boosts the chances of more purchases.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Did we mention all the benefits that mobile apps offer to small businesses? Unfortunately, we likely missed quite a few. But these advantages at least portray how small companies and startups can take advantage of a level playing field shared by big brands of their niches.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d45d1033fc57\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/how-small-companies-can-benefit-from-mobile-app-development-india-d45d1033fc57\">How Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://productcoalition.com\">Product Coalition</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Never before have we seen such an overwhelming boom of small business apps than what we are observing now.

From monitoring the field staff in real-time to collaborating on service-related issues, mobile apps in more than one way can ensure operational ease in companies depending on field service or field professionals.\nThanks to real-time collaboration and the capability to track employees and tasks through mobile apps, businesses can also make considerable cost savings for operational tasks. Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.\nTaking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps\nWith the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches. So today, you have doorstep food delivery apps, an on-demand app for barbers and beauticians, apps for housemaid services and apps for almost everything that can cater to on-demand needs.\nThe best thing about on-demand apps is that you don’t need to start a completely new business catering to the demands of the customers registered through a mobile app. You can either just turn your good old website or the existing mobile app into an on-demand app to cater to more customers, or you can just register with an aggregator or marketplace app and allow customers to buy your services or products through that app.\nWhen it comes to in-demand apps, the sky’s the limit for a small business to prosper. For example, suppose you are a local grocery shop with a limited clientele. In that case, you can just build your grocery delivery app and offer doorstep delivery services throughout the whole city and even beyond the city limits.\nOn-demand app development in India is on the rise, thanks to the overwhelming number of unique services and solutions these apps are providing. For example, an app offering tattoo and body graffiti artists services in every city area can just be availed by the people and artist professionals alike.\nEnhancing Customer Loyalty\nA mobile app, unlike a website, doesn’t get lost in the clamour and noise of the web. It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often. But a customer using your app knows your brand more personal and is likely to interact with your brand quite often.\nThe mobile app can help retain users with more certainty than any other digital interface. The personalized push notifications, customer-centric value creation through loyalty programs and special offers can help boost customer footfall and brand loyalty. Mobile apps can be the right tool in the measures for customer loyalty enhancement.\nData-driven Decision Making\nThese days even small businesses understand the value of data and data-driven insights in the decision-making and strategy-building processes. This is where mobile apps play a very crucial role. Mobile apps help a business capture various customer data referring to locations, preferences, online user behavior, taste and choices and other factors. This huge pool of customer data can help a business make decisions affecting sales and business conversion positively.\nFrom capturing the customer’s demographic data to knowing the exact location of the customers to understanding the actual context and situation of the customers, mobile apps can help a business with potential data inputs in numerous ways. For example, depending upon the time, season, urgency and other data, a customer can be approached at the right time that boosts the chances of more purchases.\nConclusion\nDid we mention all the benefits that mobile apps offer to small businesses? Unfortunately, we likely missed quite a few. But these advantages at least portray how small companies and startups can take advantage of a level playing field shared by big brands of their niches.\n\nHow Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India? was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Juned Ghanchi","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d45d1033fc57","categories":["mobile-app-developers","mobile-app-development","app-development","on-demand-app-development","app-development-india"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T10:41:45.000Z"},{"creator":"Juned Ghanchi","title":"How Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India?","link":"https://productcoalition.com/how-small-companies-can-benefit-from-mobile-app-development-india-d45d1033fc57?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 10:41:45 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DAoAeFaAFI21iVUc_ETKQw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Never before have we seen such an overwhelming boom of small business apps than what we are observing now.

From monitoring the field staff in real-time to collaborating on service-related issues, mobile apps in more than one way can ensure operational ease in companies depending on field service or field professionals.\nThanks to real-time collaboration and the capability to track employees and tasks through mobile apps, businesses can also make considerable cost savings for operational tasks. Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.\nTaking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps\nWith the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches. So today, you have doorstep food delivery apps, an on-demand app for barbers and beauticians, apps for housemaid services and apps for almost everything that can cater to on-demand needs.\nThe best thing about on-demand apps is that you don’t need to start a completely new business catering to the demands of the customers registered through a mobile app. You can either just turn your good old website or the existing mobile app into an on-demand app to cater to more customers, or you can just register with an aggregator or marketplace app and allow customers to buy your services or products through that app.\nWhen it comes to in-demand apps, the sky’s the limit for a small business to prosper. For example, suppose you are a local grocery shop with a limited clientele. In that case, you can just build your grocery delivery app and offer doorstep delivery services throughout the whole city and even beyond the city limits.\nOn-demand app development in India is on the rise, thanks to the overwhelming number of unique services and solutions these apps are providing. For example, an app offering tattoo and body graffiti artists services in every city area can just be availed by the people and artist professionals alike.\nEnhancing Customer Loyalty\nA mobile app, unlike a website, doesn’t get lost in the clamour and noise of the web. It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often. But a customer using your app knows your brand more personal and is likely to interact with your brand quite often.\nThe mobile app can help retain users with more certainty than any other digital interface. The personalized push notifications, customer-centric value creation through loyalty programs and special offers can help boost customer footfall and brand loyalty. Mobile apps can be the right tool in the measures for customer loyalty enhancement.\nData-driven Decision Making\nThese days even small businesses understand the value of data and data-driven insights in the decision-making and strategy-building processes. This is where mobile apps play a very crucial role. Mobile apps help a business capture various customer data referring to locations, preferences, online user behavior, taste and choices and other factors. This huge pool of customer data can help a business make decisions affecting sales and business conversion positively.\nFrom capturing the customer’s demographic data to knowing the exact location of the customers to understanding the actual context and situation of the customers, mobile apps can help a business with potential data inputs in numerous ways. For example, depending upon the time, season, urgency and other data, a customer can be approached at the right time that boosts the chances of more purchases.\nConclusion\nDid we mention all the benefits that mobile apps offer to small businesses? Unfortunately, we likely missed quite a few. But these advantages at least portray how small companies and startups can take advantage of a level playing field shared by big brands of their niches.\n\nHow Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India? was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Juned Ghanchi","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d45d1033fc57","categories":["mobile-app-developers","mobile-app-development","app-development","on-demand-app-development","app-development-india"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T10:41:45.000Z"},{"title":"Post Uploader for Instagram — Upload post to Instagram from your PC","link":"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/post-uploader-for-instagram","pubDate":"2021-05-20T10:28:40.000Z","author":"Thomas MacGibbon","content":"      <p>\n        &#8220;\n        Functionality:\n⭐️ Upload Instagram photos and videos.

We want to build software customers love, and that sometimes requires connecting with what real people care about, and understanding from their perspective what problems are worth solving.\nHow do we connect with these customers in order to understand them? This is where identifying customer types can be useful in focusing research activities. Here is one way you can identify three customer types.\nThere are essentially three types of customers that use your software:\nCold Customers\nThey historically have not expressed a deep interest in using the product, and if they do, they rarely use it.\nCasual Customers\nThey use it more than cold customers, but they are not “in love with the product” so it is not a habit or part of their lifestyle for them to use it.\nCore Customers\nThe customers who found a way to connect with the product. They personally discovered how it could improve their lives, they love your product, and they do not want to visualize their lives without it.\nFocus on Your Core Customers\nIt’s only natural to focus on your core customers, because they have valuable experiences and stories that led them to being loyal to your product. That’s why capturing those stories can be valuable for developing other services and launching marketing initiatives. Core customers are the ones really using your product and can provide invaluable insights.\nLearn about Your Cold and Casual Customers\nRegarding the cold and casual users, one can work to examine their respective user journeys and the thoughts and feelings they associate with it. To accomplish this, strive to do the following:\n\nLearn about the situation that led them to your product.\nUnderstand the actions they take in your product.\nUnderstand what they think and feel as they take those actions, and\nDon’t forget to ask why.\n\nEvolve Your Design Process with Customer Data\nKeep in mind that your customer’s perception of the product matters more than yours — so as you dive deeper into customer data, don’t forget to explore how the perceptions they share can evolve your design process. In time and with enough practice, being mindful of these three types of customers can help you gain valuable knowledge to improve conversion and retention rates, and increase your software product lifespan.\nSpecial thanks to Angela Prentner-Smith, Katherine Pickford, Leah Lockhart, Katriona Gordon, Al Morris, and the teams at This is Milk Consultancy for their input which contributed to the development of this article.\n\nThree Types of Customers that Use Your Software Product was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Tremis Skeete","guid":"https://medium.com/p/7bf6ed9f83b9","categories":["this-is-milk","software-development","customer-experience","customer-success","customer-engagement"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T05:44:30.000Z"},{"creator":"Mike Jimenez","title":"Ambition and Determination in Product","link":"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 05:41:54 GMT","dc:creator":"Mike Jimenez","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*TNoOXZXmN0tk4mWN\" width=\"6000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">How Setting Ambitious Goals can Help and Hinder Our Products</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4\">Continue reading on Product Coalition »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"How Setting Ambitious Goals can Help and Hinder Our Products\nContinue reading on Product Coalition »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/4d9ce250a0f2","categories":["product-management","determination","product-ownership","ambition","perseverance"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T05:41:54.000Z"},{"creator":"Mike Jimenez","title":"Ambition and Determination in Product","link":"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 05:41:54 GMT","dc:creator":"Mike Jimenez","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*TNoOXZXmN0tk4mWN\" width=\"6000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">How Setting Ambitious Goals can Help and Hinder Our Products</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4\">Continue reading on Product Coalition »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"How Setting Ambitious Goals can Help and Hinder Our Products\nContinue reading on Product Coalition »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/4d9ce250a0f2","categories":["product-management","determination","product-ownership","ambition","perseverance"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T05:41:54.000Z"},{"creator":"Mike Jimenez","title":"Ambition and Determination in Product","link":"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 05:41:54 GMT","dc:creator":"Mike Jimenez","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*TNoOXZXmN0tk4mWN\" width=\"6000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">How Setting Ambitious Goals can Help and Hinder Our Products</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/ambition-and-determination-in-product-4d9ce250a0f2?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4\">Continue reading on Product Coalition »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"How Setting Ambitious Goals can Help and Hinder Our Products\nContinue reading on Product Coalition »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/4d9ce250a0f2","categories":["product-management","determination","product-ownership","ambition","perseverance"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T05:41:54.000Z"},{"creator":"Stefan Wolpers","title":"The Developers Code Fallacy — Making Your Scrum Work #9","link":"https://age-of-product.com/developers-dont-talk-customers-fallacy-making-your-scrum-wor/","pubDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 03:32:01 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>TL; DR: The Developers Code Fallacy — They Should Talk to Customers, Too, Though</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum.

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;</li>\r\n\t<li>Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;</li>\r\n\t<li>Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>Holding each other accountable as professionals.</li>\r\n</ul></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#developers\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team’s Product Owner supports creating a shared understanding among all Scrum team members on the why, the what, and the how. However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>The Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/developers-dont-talk-customers-fallacy-making-your-scrum-wor/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers Code Fallacy — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.\n \r\n\r\nThe Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented.

(My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity. It is a sign for an organization still profoundly stuck in industrial paradigm thinking.\n\r\n\r\nJoin me and explore the reasons and the consequences of this Scrum anti-pattern in 110 seconds.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:\n\r\n\r\n\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCreating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n\r\n\t\nInstilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nAdapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n\r\n\t\nHolding each other accountable as professionals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nThe team’s Product Owner supports creating a shared understanding among all Scrum team members on the why, the what, and the how. However, the real magic starts unfolding when Developers observe customers when they use the product and listen to them sharing their everyday problems.\n \r\n\r\nThe Developers Code Fallacy Leaves Value on the Table\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers Code Fallacy — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nIf your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”\n\r\n\r\nWhat other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

Given that Scrum is a framework with a precise and concise yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. While the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum, stakeholders themselves are no official role (accountability), no matter their crucial contribution to a Scrum team’s overall success.\nExplore with me three widespread examples of how stakeholders fail their Scrum teams in three short video clips, totaling 6 minutes and 5 seconds.\n\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\nJoin more than 210 peers from May 27–29, 2021, for the Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021, a live virtual Barcamp using open space technology principles and practices.\nThe Scrum Guide on Stakeholders\nLet’s refresh our memories regarding stakeholders according to the 2020 Scrum Guide. While stakeholders are not an official accountability, the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum:\nPage 4: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.\nPage 5: The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.\nPage 6: The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.\nPage 6: The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog.\nPage 6: Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work.\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.\nPage 8: The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.\nPage 8: [Sprint Planning: Why is this Sprint valuable?] The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.\nPage 9: The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.\nPage 9: During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.\nPage 10: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.\nPage 10: These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.\nPage 12: However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.\nPage 12: The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.\nSource: The Scrum Guide on stakeholders. (This aggregation is from the Scrum Guide 2020 Reordered.)\nDownload the ’Scrum Anti-Patterns Guide’ for Free:\n\nThree Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\nLet me point at three Scrum stakeholder failures that have the potential to derail your organization’s attempt at achieving business agility with Scrum:\nTurning the Sprint Review into a Stakeholder Approval Instance\nIn my experience, the Sprint Review acceptance gate by stakeholders is an anti-pattern typical for organizations that are still rooted in the industrial paradigm, exercising command & control. Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\nhttps://medium.com/media/f67160df06e848ae147a5071256b09e6/href\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it.\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.)\nhttps://medium.com/media/8bf7b054d7b65f097a559a52ac6e0a91/href\nThere Is no Failure Culture\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option.\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed — without repercussions — so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\nhttps://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions.

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li>\r\n\t<li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>There Is no Failure Culture</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

(This aggregation is from the Scrum Guide 2020 Reordered.)\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me point at three Scrum stakeholder failures that have the potential to derail your organization’s attempt at achieving business agility with Scrum:\n\r\n\r\nTurning the Sprint Review into a Stakeholder Approval Instance\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the Sprint Review acceptance gate by stakeholders is an anti-pattern typical for organizations that are still rooted in the industrial paradigm, exercising command & control. Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\n\r\n\t\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\n\r\n\t\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\n \r\n\r\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\n\r\n\r\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li>\r\n\t<li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>There Is no Failure Culture</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

While stakeholders are not an official accountability, the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum:\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nPage 4: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.\n\r\n\t\nPage 5: The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog.\n\r\n\t\nPage 6: Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work.\n\r\n\t\nPage 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.\n\r\n\t\nPage 8: The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.\n\r\n\t\nPage 8: [Sprint Planning: Why is this Sprint valuable?] The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nPage 9: The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.\n\r\n\t\nPage 9: During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.\n\r\n\t\nPage 10: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.\n\r\n\t\nPage 10: These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nPage 12: However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.\n\r\n\t\nPage 12: The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on stakeholders. (This aggregation is from the Scrum Guide 2020 Reordered.)\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me point at three Scrum stakeholder failures that have the potential to derail your organization’s attempt at achieving business agility with Scrum:\n\r\n\r\nTurning the Sprint Review into a Stakeholder Approval Instance\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the Sprint Review acceptance gate by stakeholders is an anti-pattern typical for organizations that are still rooted in the industrial paradigm, exercising command & control. Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\n\r\n\t\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\n\r\n\t\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\n \r\n\r\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\n\r\n\r\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Here are what we can do:\n\nRecognize the bias: Most likely biases will influence your thinking and recognizing this is the first step to reduce it.\nIdentify the bias: After we can recognize that there are some biases on our thinking, we need to be able to identify what are the biases at play. Try to step back and revisit the information that was processed. Do we process it neutrally? Or do we have preconceptions when we process the information?\nChallenge the bias: After we can identify the bias, now we can challenge it. Try to see the problem or information from someone else’s point of view. Now try to see it under multiple scenarios. Or try to see the information as if you are seeing it for the first time with no background and see how does that change your perception.\n\nTry to do these exercises when making decisions.

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;</li>\r\n\t<li>Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;</li>\r\n\t<li>Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>Holding each other accountable as professionals.</li>\r\n</ul></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#developers\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Over-Delivering Is an Indicator for the Developers’ Lack of Professionalism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This Scrum anti-pattern is easy to spot: The Developers increase the Sprint&#8217;s scope by adding unnecessary effort to work items of Sprint Backlog, also referred to as scope-stretching or gold-plating beyond Done. Typically, this is done without prior consulting of the Product Owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ignorance of previously made agreements during the refinement process may result in a questionable allocation of resources by neglecting basic business principles like considering opportunity costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about when faced with gold-plating? Try to address the following issues in the next Sprint Retrospective:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\u000b\r\n\t<li>Are Developers and the Product Owner talking often enough with each other, is the Product Backlog refinement process up to the job?  \u000b</li>\r\n\t<li>Are the Developers aware that it is their responsibility to make sound investment decisions when creating Product Increments? Good enough, as in “meets the Definition of Done and the intended purpose,” is a viable approach. It does not always need to be the most elegant, best possible quality solution as long as the Increment delivers the intended value. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably, you also want to analyze whether decisions made in the past, for example, the design of extended software architecture, are now driving decisions. So, for example, developers might be doubling down to underline that the previous decision was correct. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, as we are all humans, brace for the occasional over-excitement on the Developers&#8217; side. Sometimes, a third and brand-new JavaScript framework is simply needed in your application. #sigh</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/gold-plating-done-making-your-scrum-work-7/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjxFeaBWWr-k%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gold-Plating Beyond Done  — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to develop an entrepreneurial mindset, not just the Product Owner. The Developers, in particular, are prone to oversee this necessity while at the same time making far-reaching product decisions daily. As Scrum Master and Product Owner, you need to help them fully embrace this level of accountability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Sprint anti-patterns have you observed?

Typically, this is done without prior consulting of the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nThis ignorance of previously made agreements during the refinement process may result in a questionable allocation of resources by neglecting basic business principles like considering opportunity costs.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about when faced with gold-plating?

Moreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide on how they plan to do this:\n\r\n\r\n\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCreating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n\r\n\t\nInstilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nAdapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n\r\n\t\nHolding each other accountable as professionals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Over-Delivering Is an Indicator for the Developers’ Lack of Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThis Scrum anti-pattern is easy to spot: The Developers increase the Sprint’s scope by adding unnecessary effort to work items of Sprint Backlog, also referred to as scope-stretching or gold-plating beyond Done. Typically, this is done without prior consulting of the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nThis ignorance of previously made agreements during the refinement process may result in a questionable allocation of resources by neglecting basic business principles like considering opportunity costs.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about when faced with gold-plating? Try to address the following issues in the next Sprint Retrospective:\n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nAre Developers and the Product Owner talking often enough with each other, is the Product Backlog refinement process up to the job?  \u000b\n\r\n\t\nAre the Developers aware that it is their responsibility to make sound investment decisions when creating Product Increments? Good enough, as in “meets the Definition of Done and the intended purpose,” is a viable approach. It does not always need to be the most elegant, best possible quality solution as long as the Increment delivers the intended value. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably, you also want to analyze whether decisions made in the past, for example, the design of extended software architecture, are now driving decisions. So, for example, developers might be doubling down to underline that the previous decision was correct. \n\r\n\r\nFinally, as we are all humans, brace for the occasional over-excitement on the Developers’ side. Sometimes, a third and brand-new JavaScript framework is simply needed in your application. #sigh\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nGold-Plating Beyond Done  — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nIf your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to develop an entrepreneurial mindset, not just the Product Owner. The Developers, in particular, are prone to oversee this necessity while at the same time making far-reaching product decisions daily.

But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">generate as much buy-in as possible</a>, as I explain in more detail in my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16393\">Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People</a>.&#8221; But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don&#8217;t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires <em>full-stack ownership</em>: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a> to the product details. The individual should carry out<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\"> product discovery</a> and strategy work in addition to taking care of the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog work</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">Scaling the Product Owner</a>.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png\" alt=\"Full-stack product owner vs. partial product owner\" class=\"wp-image-17099\" width=\"661\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-300x147.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-768x377.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO.png 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Be therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the product owner, you should focus on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10812\">product</a>, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">sacrifice your health</a>—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">care about the development teams</a> you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-owner-sprint-retrospective/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8232\">sprint retrospective</a>. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how <em>you</em> can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery work</a>, spending more time jointly <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/refining-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15179\">refining the product backlog</a>, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">review finished work</a> results during the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">Refining the product backlog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">writing user stories</a> is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is important that you don&#8217;t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a>, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-planning-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14390\">create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint</a> and succeed in meeting the sprint goal. If the items are too big and coarse-grained, most teams will struggle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, strike the right balance between strategic and tactical work and spend enough time working on the product backlog together with the development team members. As the product owner, it&#8217;s your responsibility that the work required to progress the product and reach the (next) <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">product goal</a> is adequately captured in the product backlog. Such a backlog has enough “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>” high-priority items to guide the work of the development team and to allow its members to create a “done” product increment—executable software that is tested and documented and that could be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #5: It’s the product owner’s job to get the project delivered</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional approaches to software development, Scrum does not offer the role of a project manager. It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a <em>product management</em> role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it. To put it differently, you can think of the product owner as a product life-cycle manager, which encourages decisions that result in sustainable growth and consider the product’s longer-term impact on the users and the business. The picture below illustrates this concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png\" alt=\"Product owner and the product life cycle\" class=\"wp-image-17100\" width=\"525\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png 1008w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-300x235.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture above shows how a product might create value over time together with three key events: launching the product, achieving product-market fit, and retiring the product (end of life). Only once it has achieved product-market fit (PMF) and entered the growth stage, has a product started to become successful. A product owner should therefore look after a product at least until PMF, preferably longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with the job of a project manager who is responsible for delivering a project to an agreed scope on time and on budget. Once that’s been achieved, the project manager’s work is done, and the individual often moves on and works on another project, which might progress a different product. A project manager is therefore focused on a comparatively short-term effort instead of a longer-term outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, avoid being a <em>project</em> owner but aspire to manage your product for an extended period, ideally for its entire life cycle. This does not imply, however, that you should not care about meeting a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goal</a> in a realistic timeframe on an agreed budget. The opposite is the case: Use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release planning tools and techniques</a> that work for you to track and guide the development progress. But create a continuity of purpose by working with a product roadmap like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO roadmap</a> that captures the specific outcomes the product is likely to create in the next six to twelve months.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/\">Five Product Owner Myths Busted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Myth #1: The product owner must ensure that the stakeholders are satisfied\nStakeholders can be powerful and influential individuals.

The individual should carry out<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\"> product discovery</a> and strategy work in addition to taking care of the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog work</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">Scaling the Product Owner</a>.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png\" alt=\"Full-stack product owner vs. partial product owner\" class=\"wp-image-17099\" width=\"661\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-300x147.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-768x377.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO.png 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Be therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the product owner, you should focus on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10812\">product</a>, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">sacrifice your health</a>—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">care about the development teams</a> you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-owner-sprint-retrospective/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8232\">sprint retrospective</a>. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how <em>you</em> can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery work</a>, spending more time jointly <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/refining-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15179\">refining the product backlog</a>, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">review finished work</a> results during the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">Refining the product backlog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">writing user stories</a> is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is important that you don&#8217;t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a>, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-planning-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14390\">create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint</a> and succeed in meeting the sprint goal. If the items are too big and coarse-grained, most teams will struggle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, strike the right balance between strategic and tactical work and spend enough time working on the product backlog together with the development team members. As the product owner, it&#8217;s your responsibility that the work required to progress the product and reach the (next) <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">product goal</a> is adequately captured in the product backlog. Such a backlog has enough “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>” high-priority items to guide the work of the development team and to allow its members to create a “done” product increment—executable software that is tested and documented and that could be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #5: It’s the product owner’s job to get the project delivered</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional approaches to software development, Scrum does not offer the role of a project manager. It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a <em>product management</em> role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it. To put it differently, you can think of the product owner as a product life-cycle manager, which encourages decisions that result in sustainable growth and consider the product’s longer-term impact on the users and the business. The picture below illustrates this concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png\" alt=\"Product owner and the product life cycle\" class=\"wp-image-17100\" width=\"525\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png 1008w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-300x235.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture above shows how a product might create value over time together with three key events: launching the product, achieving product-market fit, and retiring the product (end of life). Only once it has achieved product-market fit (PMF) and entered the growth stage, has a product started to become successful. A product owner should therefore look after a product at least until PMF, preferably longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with the job of a project manager who is responsible for delivering a project to an agreed scope on time and on budget. Once that’s been achieved, the project manager’s work is done, and the individual often moves on and works on another project, which might progress a different product. A project manager is therefore focused on a comparatively short-term effort instead of a longer-term outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, avoid being a <em>project</em> owner but aspire to manage your product for an extended period, ideally for its entire life cycle. This does not imply, however, that you should not care about meeting a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goal</a> in a realistic timeframe on an agreed budget. The opposite is the case: Use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release planning tools and techniques</a> that work for you to track and guide the development progress. But create a continuity of purpose by working with a product roadmap like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO roadmap</a> that captures the specific outcomes the product is likely to create in the next six to twelve months.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/\">Five Product Owner Myths Busted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Myth #1: The product owner must ensure that the stakeholders are satisfied\nStakeholders can be powerful and influential individuals. But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal stakeholders such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.\nAt the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and generate as much buy-in as possible, as I explain in more detail in my article “Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People.” But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don’t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.\nMyth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog\nIn Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires full-stack ownership: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the product vision to the product details. The individual should carry out product discovery and strategy work in addition to taking care of the product backlog work.\nBut the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe.

Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nCreate and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my upcoming training classes here.\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\n\r\n\r\nIt helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nWhat principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Complexity-Stacey-Matrix-Scrum.jpg\" alt=\"Four Scrum Master Success Principles: Complexity, the Stacey Matrix — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65949\" data-wp-pid=\"65949\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Complexity-Stacey-Matrix-Scrum.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Complexity-Stacey-Matrix-Scrum-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Strive for High Product Quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level.

Age-of-Product.com \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Technical-Debt-Performance.jpg\" alt=\"Product Quality, Technical Debt, Definition of Done — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65951\" data-wp-pid=\"65951\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Technical-Debt-Performance.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Technical-Debt-Performance-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Garbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice.

I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Value-Rader.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Management, Scrum Values — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65950\" data-wp-pid=\"65950\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Value-Rader.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Value-Rader-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>All sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people.com/events/\" title=\"Professional Scrum Classes by PST Stefan Wolpers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming training classes here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more than 195 peers from May 27-29, 2021, for the Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021, a live virtual Barcamp using open space technology principles and practices.\n\r\n\r\nMeeting Stakeholder Expectations\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how diverse the stakeholders of your Scrum Team are, they are all united in one expectation: Your Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience, four first principles support Scrum Masters to help their teams deliver on this expectation:\n\r\n\r\nChoose Scrum for the Right Purpose\n\r\n\r\nChoosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nCreate and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my upcoming training classes here.\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\n\r\n\r\nIt helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nWhat principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

We appreciate a new ebook on dealing with difficult stakeholders and critical situations, and we learn a simple approach to measuring team productivity: Don’t touch velocity! </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we learn that Gitlab identified a new DevOps maturity model. </p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #291: Hypotheses Validation, Authentic Feedback, Measuring Productivity, The Art of Removing Features — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65945\" data-wp-pid=\"65945\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65937\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-290-design-thinking-scrum/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #290: Design Thinking Scrum, Product vs. Project Teams, Agile Leadership Practice Library, Disrupting Disrupters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #290</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.\n\r\n\r\nWe then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches. We appreciate a new ebook on dealing with difficult stakeholders and critical situations, and we learn a simple approach to measuring team productivity: Don’t touch velocity! \n \r\n\r\nLastly, we learn that Gitlab identified a new DevOps maturity model. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you miss the previous Food for Agile Thought’s issue #290?\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-retrospective\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020 on the Sprint Retrospective\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\u000b\r\n\t<li>Commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b</li>\r\n\t<li>If Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives — Scrum Values — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65925\" data-wp-pid=\"65925\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/data-informed-retrospectives/\" title=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data-Informed Retrospectives</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0EHmvUIngkQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure. Among those, the blame game, the finger-pointing, is the most obvious and challenging that requires the utmost attention from all team members to overcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Sprint Retrospective anti-patterns have you observed?

Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThe Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: \n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nCommitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b\n\r\n\t\nIf Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure.

You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more than 170 peers from May 27-29, 2021, for the Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021, a live virtual Barcamp using open space technology principles and practices.\n\r\n\r\nThe Purpose of the Sprint Retrospective According to the Scrum Guide\n\r\n\r\nThe Sprint Retrospective reflects both a Scrum team’s ambition to continuously improve as well as its empowerment:\n\r\n\r\n\nThe purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.\n\r\n\r\nThe Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThe Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: \n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nCommitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b\n\r\n\t\nIf Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure. Among those, the blame game, the finger-pointing, is the most obvious and challenging that requires the utmost attention from all team members to overcome.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sprint Retrospective anti-patterns have you observed?

Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Garbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers &#038; the organization. </li>\r\n\t<li>The Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpet3ZRyTx34%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Product Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You are likely to end up in a feature factory.</li>\r\n\t<li>Probably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" title=\"Conway’s law\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conway’s law</a>: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.”)</li>\r\n\t<li>If you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fgc15kRtrNVg%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>I Know What to Build—Follow Me!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks &#038; balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0Zl-FMOjS9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Product Owner failures have you observed?

In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are likely to end up in a feature factory.\n\r\n\t\nProbably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (Conway’s law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”)\n\r\n\t\nIf you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know What to Build—Follow Me!\n\r\n\r\nIn this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. \n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks & balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Product Owner failures have you observed?

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:\n\r\n\r\nOversized Product Backlogs\n \r\n\r\nThe Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nGarbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are likely to end up in a feature factory.\n\r\n\t\nProbably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (Conway’s law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”)\n\r\n\t\nIf you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know What to Build—Follow Me!\n\r\n\r\nIn this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. \n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks & balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Product Owner failures have you observed?

This week, we delve into Design Thinking Scrum, and we note that most frameworks pay a lot of attention to decision making, less, though, to understanding decisions. We also share the agile leadership practice library, and we point at the12th principle of the Agile Manifesto: A self-managing team also needs to be a self-learning team.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then point at the advantages of product teams over project teams, and we learn when and how to get involved with Lean, Agile, and Design Thinking regarding your product lifecycle. Moreover, we enjoy describing a hiring process based on auditioning, not interviewing, the best candidates.  </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we appreciate ThoughtWork’s latest version of its tech radar, and we ask: Who Disrupts the Disrupters? </p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-290-Design-Thinking-Scrum.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #290: Design Thinking Scrum, Product vs. Project Teams, Agile Leadership Practice Library, Disrupting Disrupters — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65933\" data-wp-pid=\"65933\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-290-Design-Thinking-Scrum.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-290-Design-Thinking-Scrum-825x413.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-290-Design-Thinking-Scrum-800x400.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65929\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-289-fast-agile/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #289: FAST Agile, OKRs’ Dark Side, PM Competency Framework, Breaking into Product Management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #289</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

The second stage refers to gathering data so that the Scrum Team can have data-informed Retrospectives. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I have observed in practice, many Scrum Teams either limit the data gathering part of the Retrospective, thus lacking vital information.

This week, we delve into Design Thinking Scrum, and we note that most frameworks pay a lot of attention to decision making, less, though, to understanding decisions. We also share the agile leadership practice library, and we point at the12th principle of the Agile Manifesto: A self-managing team also needs to be a self-learning team.  \n\r\n\r\nWe then point at the advantages of product teams over project teams, and we learn when and how to get involved with Lean, Agile, and Design Thinking regarding your product lifecycle. Moreover, we enjoy describing a hiring process based on auditioning, not interviewing, the best candidates.  \n \r\n\r\nLastly, we appreciate ThoughtWork’s latest version of its tech radar, and we ask: Who Disrupts the Disrupters? \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you miss the previous Food for Agile Thought’s issue #289?\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

The second stage refers to gathering data so that the Scrum Team can have data-informed Retrospectives. \n\r\n\r\nAs I have observed in practice, many Scrum Teams either limit the data gathering part of the Retrospective, thus lacking vital information. Or they invest too much time doing so, leaving little capacity to analyze the data and come to conclusions on how to best improve as a team.\n\r\n\r\nRead on and learn how you can avoid falling victim to both scenarios by gathering data continuously and asynchronously.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n🛠 Tools & Measuring\n\r\n\r\n\nCrystal Widjaja (via Reforge): Scaling Data: Data Informed to Data Driven to Data Led\nCrystal Widjaja details the path to scaling data for startups.\n\nSource: Reforge: Scaling Data: Data Informed to Data Driven to Data Led\nAuthor: Crystal Widjaja\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n (via ThoughtWorks): Technology Radar Vol. 24\nThoughtWorks released the latest version of its tech radar.\n\nSource: ThoughtWorks: Technology Radar Vol. 24\n\r\n\r\n\r\n📅 Scrum Training Classes, Workshops, and Events\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\r\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 19px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}\r\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 19px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}\r\n.tg .tg-fymr{font-weight:bold;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\r\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {.tg {width: auto !important;}.tg col {width: auto !important;}.tg-wrap {overflow-x: auto;-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;}}\r\n\n\r\n  \n\r\n    Date\r\n    Class and Language\r\n    City\r\n    Price\r\n  \n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 💯 🇬🇧 May 18-21, 2021\r\n    GUARANTEED: Advanced Professional Scrum Master Online Training w/ PSM II Certificate\r\n    Live Virtual Class \r\n    €1.199 incl. 19% VAT\r\n  \n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 💯 🇬🇧 May 27-29, 2021\r\n    GUARANTEED: Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021\r\n    Live Virtual Conference \r\n    €29 incl. 19% VAT\r\n  \n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 🇬🇧 June 1-2, 2021\r\n    Professional Scrum Master Training (PSM I; English; Live Virtual Class)\r\n    Live Virtual Class \r\n    €1.199 incl. 19% VAT\r\n  \n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 🇩🇪 June 15-18, 2021\r\n    <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people.com/de/event/professional-scrum-master-schulung-psm-i-zertifikat-april-2021/\" title=\"🖥 🇩🇪 Professional Scrum Master Schulung mit PSM I Zertifikat — Online: 15. bis 18.

The second stage refers to gathering data so that the Scrum Team can have data-informed Retrospectives. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I have observed in practice, many Scrum Teams either limit the data gathering part of the Retrospective, thus lacking vital information. Or they invest too much time doing so, leaving little capacity to analyze the data and come to conclusions on how to best improve as a team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on and learn how you can avoid falling victim to both scenarios by gathering data continuously and asynchronously.</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Informed-Retrospectives.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives — Age-of-Product.oom\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65926\" data-wp-pid=\"65926\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Informed-Retrospectives.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Informed-Retrospectives-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learn more</strong>: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/data-informed-retrospectives/\" title=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives — Age-of-Product.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data-Informed Retrospectives</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>🛠 Tools &#038;

This week, we delve into Design Thinking Scrum, and we note that most frameworks pay a lot of attention to decision making, less, though, to understanding decisions. We also share the agile leadership practice library, and we point at the12th principle of the Agile Manifesto: A self-managing team also needs to be a self-learning team.  \n\r\n\r\nWe then point at the advantages of product teams over project teams, and we learn when and how to get involved with Lean, Agile, and Design Thinking regarding your product lifecycle.

The second stage refers to gathering data so that the Scrum Team can have data-informed Retrospectives. \n\r\n\r\nAs I have observed in practice, many Scrum Teams either limit the data gathering part of the Retrospective, thus lacking vital information. Or they invest too much time doing so, leaving little capacity to analyze the data and come to conclusions on how to best improve as a team.\n\r\n\r\nRead on and learn how you can avoid falling victim to both scenarios by gathering data continuously and asynchronously.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n🛠 Tools & Measuring\n\r\n\r\n\nCrystal Widjaja (via Reforge): Scaling Data: Data Informed to Data Driven to Data Led\nCrystal Widjaja details the path to scaling data for startups.\n\nSource: Reforge: Scaling Data: Data Informed to Data Driven to Data Led\nAuthor: Crystal Widjaja\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n (via ThoughtWorks): Technology Radar Vol. 24\nThoughtWorks released the latest version of its tech radar.\n\nSource: ThoughtWorks: Technology Radar Vol. 24\n\r\n\r\n\r\n📅 Scrum Training Classes, Workshops, and Events\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\r\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 19px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}\r\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 19px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}\r\n.tg .tg-fymr{font-weight:bold;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\r\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {.tg {width: auto !important;}.tg col {width: auto !important;}.tg-wrap {overflow-x: auto;-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;}}\r\n\n\r\n  \n\r\n    Date\r\n    Class and Language\r\n    City\r\n    Price\r\n  \n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 💯 🇬🇧 May 18-21, 2021\r\n    GUARANTEED: Advanced Professional Scrum Master Online Training w/ PSM II Certificate\r\n    Live Virtual Class \r\n    €1.199 incl. 19% VAT\r\n  \n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 💯 🇬🇧 May 27-29, 2021\r\n    GUARANTEED: Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021\r\n    Live Virtual Conference \r\n    €29 incl. 19% VAT\r\n  \n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 🇬🇧 June 1-2, 2021\r\n    Professional Scrum Master Training (PSM I; English; Live Virtual Class)\r\n    Live Virtual Class \r\n    €1.199 incl. 19% VAT\r\n  \n\r\n  \n\r\n    🖥 🇩🇪 June 15-18, 2021\r\n    <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people.com/de/event/professional-scrum-master-schulung-psm-i-zertifikat-april-2021/\" title=\"🖥 🇩🇪 Professional Scrum Master Schulung mit PSM I Zertifikat — Online: 15. bis 18.

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want to offer a product that <em>reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes </em>and that <em>generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app</em>. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">strategy validation techniques</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> I have captured on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">Product Goals in Scrum</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to <em>allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base</em>. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen <em>user feedback</em>, <em>net promoter score</em>, and <em>referral rate</em>, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, <em>acquire an initial user base</em>, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Health Indicators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/technical-debt-and-product-success/\">technical debt</a>, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less is More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better.

In the worst case, you act on irrelevant data and make wrong decisions. Think of driving a car. A small number of indicators are helpful for safely getting to your destination, including how fast you are travelling and how much battery/fuel is left. If the car dashboard continuously showed a range of other data, such as tyre pressure or ABS status, it would be harder to take in the relevant information and make the right decisions while driving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, limit the number of KPIs you use.

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want to offer a product that <em>reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes </em>and that <em>generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app</em>. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">strategy validation techniques</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> I have captured on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">Product Goals in Scrum</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to <em>allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base</em>. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen <em>user feedback</em>, <em>net promoter score</em>, and <em>referral rate</em>, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, <em>acquire an initial user base</em>, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Health Indicators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/technical-debt-and-product-success/\">technical debt</a>, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less is More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better. This includes the analytics tools we have available today. These powerful tools usually generate more data for us than we can handle. And herein lies the issue: There is no point in measuring everything that can be measured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using more KPIs than necessary and analysing data that provides no value is a waste of time. In the worst case, you act on irrelevant data and make wrong decisions. Think of driving a car. A small number of indicators are helpful for safely getting to your destination, including how fast you are travelling and how much battery/fuel is left. If the car dashboard continuously showed a range of other data, such as tyre pressure or ABS status, it would be harder to take in the relevant information and make the right decisions while driving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, limit the number of KPIs you use.

The rest of the product backlog emerges to define ‘what’ will fulfill the product goal.” The product owner is accountable for “developing and explicitly communicating the product goal.” The entire Scrum team is “focused on one … product goal” at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this definition leaves you scratching your head, don’t worry. Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied. As a consequence, different people have suggested different ways to apply the product goal. Some view it as the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a>, others equate it to the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">value proposition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a <em>specific and measurable benefit or outcome</em> a product should create in the course of the next <em>two to six months</em>. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are <em>connected to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a></em> and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16846\" width=\"482\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png 993w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-300x252.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-768x644.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The Product Goal in Context</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal. At the same token, each product goal acts as the foundation for identifying helpful <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>. In other words, the goals are connected and form a cascading set of product-related goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please see my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">Leading Through Shared Goals</a>” and my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em> for more information how to effectively use the goals in figure 1, which includes securing the necessary buy-in from the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">development teams</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Background Story</strong>: Readers familiar with the history of Scrum—sometimes lovingly referred to as Scrumtorians—will undoubtedly know that it has contained sprint goals at least <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Software-Development-SCRUM-International/dp/0130676349/\" target=\"_blank\">since 2002</a> and a (product) vision <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Management-Developer-Practices-Schwaber-2004-02-21/dp/B00HTJPJME/\" target=\"_blank\">since 2004</a>, even though the latter is not mentioned in the Scrum Guide. When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal. It took me years to come up with the set of goals in figure 1. In hindsight, the set looks disappointingly simple <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the contents of this article on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my YouTube Channel</a>:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Product Goals In Scrum\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0NWukbHkDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sample Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand how the goals in figure 1 can be applied, let’s take a look at an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16847\" width=\"491\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-300x237.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-768x606.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Sample Goals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 2, I first captured the vision “Help people eat healthily” and then used it to choose the user and business goals “Reduce the risk of developing type-two diabetes; create new revenue source.” In order to determine the right product goal, I asked myself, “What would be a first good step to meet the from the user and business goal?” I consequently chose the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” I then used this goal to determine the right sprint goal.

The rest of the product backlog emerges to define ‘what’ will fulfill the product goal.” The product owner is accountable for “developing and explicitly communicating the product goal.” The entire Scrum team is “focused on one … product goal” at a time.\nIf this definition leaves you scratching your head, don’t worry. Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied. As a consequence, different people have suggested different ways to apply the product goal. Some view it as the product vision, others equate it to the product’s value proposition.\nI find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a specific and measurable benefit or outcome a product should create in the course of the next two to six months. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.\nWhat’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are connected to the product strategy and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.\nFigure 1: The Product Goal in Context\nIn figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal. At the same token, each product goal acts as the foundation for identifying helpful sprint goals. In other words, the goals are connected and form a cascading set of product-related goals.\nPlease see my article “Leading Through Shared Goals” and my book How to Lead in Product Management for more information how to effectively use the goals in figure 1, which includes securing the necessary buy-in from the stakeholders and development teams.\nBackground Story: Readers familiar with the history of Scrum—sometimes lovingly referred to as Scrumtorians—will undoubtedly know that it has contained sprint goals at least since 2002 and a (product) vision since 2004, even though the latter is not mentioned in the Scrum Guide. When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal.

The rest of the product backlog emerges to define ‘what’ will fulfill the product goal.” The product owner is accountable for “developing and explicitly communicating the product goal.” The entire Scrum team is “focused on one … product goal” at a time.\nIf this definition leaves you scratching your head, don’t worry. Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied. As a consequence, different people have suggested different ways to apply the product goal. Some view it as the product vision, others equate it to the product’s value proposition.\nI find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a specific and measurable benefit or outcome a product should create in the course of the next two to six months. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.\nWhat’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are connected to the product strategy and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.\nFigure 1: The Product Goal in Context\nIn figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal. At the same token, each product goal acts as the foundation for identifying helpful sprint goals. In other words, the goals are connected and form a cascading set of product-related goals.\nPlease see my article “Leading Through Shared Goals” and my book How to Lead in Product Management for more information how to effectively use the goals in figure 1, which includes securing the necessary buy-in from the stakeholders and development teams.\nBackground Story: Readers familiar with the history of Scrum—sometimes lovingly referred to as Scrumtorians—will undoubtedly know that it has contained sprint goals at least since 2002 and a (product) vision since 2004, even though the latter is not mentioned in the Scrum Guide. When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal. It took me years to come up with the set of goals in figure 1. In hindsight, the set looks disappointingly simple \nYou can also access the contents of this article on my YouTube Channel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Goals\nTo better understand how the goals in figure 1 can be applied, let’s take a look at an example.\nFigure 2: Sample Goals\nIn figure 2, I first captured the vision “Help people eat healthily” and then used it to choose the user and business goals “Reduce the risk of developing type-two diabetes; create new revenue source.” In order to determine the right product goal, I asked myself, “What would be a first good step to meet the from the user and business goal?” I consequently chose the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” I then used this goal to determine the right sprint goal. I figured that finding out if users are willing to share personal information when activating the app would be the most important risk to address and hence should be the goal of the first sprint.\nNote that I chose to use a compound product goal in figure 2 that has a user part—help the users understand their eating habits and business—and a business one—acquire an initial user base. Both parts are closely connected: In order to acquire a user base, the product must offer tangible value to the users, and a first step to help people eat more healthily is to help them become aware of their current eating habits. You don’t have to work with compound product goals of course, if you prefer to focus your objectives on either the user or the business benefits.\nProduct Goals and the Product Roadmap\nSetting a single product goal is great. But unless you can’t see further than the next few months, I recommend determining the next three to four product goals and capturing them on your product roadmap, as figure 3 below shows.\nFigure 3: Sample GO Product Roadmap with Product Goals\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows a sample roadmap based on my GO product roadmap template, which contains three product goals. Each goal builds on the previous one thereby nicely progressing the product: The first goal helps the users become aware of their eating habits and creates and initial user base. The second one helps people improve their eating habits and acquires additional users. The third product goal, finally, helps the users improve their overall fitness and generates revenue.\nWhile the Scrum Guide does not mention identifying future product goals and adding them to the product roadmap, I find this practice very helpful: Stakeholders and dev teams usually benefit from understanding how to product is likely to evolve beyond the next two to three months. This helps the individuals create an effective sales and marketing strategy, for example, and to make the right architecture and technology decisions.\nProduct Goals and the Product Backlog\nWith a product roadmap in place, I like to select the product goal to be worked on and copy it from the roadmap to the product backlog together with any coarse-grained features that are associated with the goal. This approach is illustrated by figure 4.\nFigure 4: Product Goal and Product Backlog\nThe beauty of using a product goal in the backlog is that it focuses the latter, as I describe in my article “The Product Roadmap and the Product Backlog.” This addresses a common issue: Many product backlogs I have seen over the years were too big and too detailed. This made them hard to prioritise and difficult to update, which is bad news as long as your product is young or experiences more than small, incremental changes. In most cases, the product backlogs grew so big because they lacked a measure to decide which items should be added to the backlog and which should not. The product goal is this measure: Only add an item to the product backlog if it helps meet the product goal.\nLet’s briefly explore how a product goal might be used on the product backlog.

I would the start breaking some of the features into epics and prioritise the product backlog. Finally, I’d refine the high-priority items to be ready to start the first sprint.\nAs you can tell, I like product goals and find them very helpful, and I would encourage you to try them out if you haven’t used them.\nThe post Product Goals in Scrum appeared first on Roman Pichler.","enclosure":{"url":"https://episodes.castos.com/5e296c8fcbc2e2-83044581/Product-Goals-in-Scrum-09-03-2021-09.mp3","length":"0","type":""},"dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" title=\"Product Goals in Scrum\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mihai-lazar-yA6n_TzTSI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Goals\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>The 2020 edition of the Scrum Guide introduced a new type of goal, the product goal.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDjkQxXw-2U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Brave New Agile World</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">collaborate much more closely</a>. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/think-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"553\">product-led approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early user feedback, frequent solution validation</strong>: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/beyond-product-demo-validation-techniques-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7876\">validate our ideas</a> and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced time-to-market</strong>: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a> that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better product quality and improved adaptability</strong>: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better requirements</strong>: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\">dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work</a> and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparent development progress</strong>: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">The progress is now based on working software</a> rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved alignment</strong>: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">sprint reviews</a>. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">involving them in the process of making product decisions</a> increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivated productive teams</strong>: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Old and New Product Management Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of empowerment</strong>: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-manager-vs-product-owner/\"><em>product owner</em> instead of <em>product manager</em></a> in order to emphasise the level of <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"12541\">authority and empowerment</a> a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confusion about roles and responsibilities</strong>: Even 20 years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> was conceived, agile roles like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">product owner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the <a href=\"https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scrum Guide</a> puts it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of direct interaction with users and customers</strong>: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">agile manifesto</a>. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13288\">empathise with the users and customers</a> and to fully understand their needs. This, in turn, reduces the chances of offering a product that does a great job for its target audience and generates the desired business benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Product discovery and product strategy poorly practiced</strong>: The most beautiful user stories are useless if it’s not clear who the users are and why they would want to use the product. Acquiring this information requires focused product discovery and strategy work. Unfortunately, product discovery and strategy aren’t always effectively practiced. This is not helped by the fact that agile approaches like Scrum do not offer any tools and techniques to help product owners understand if a product should be developed. Fortunately, a number of tools and techniques have emerged in recent years that help product people with their product discovery and strategy work including my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-vision-board/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1817\">product vision board</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO product roadmap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of sustainable pace</strong>: “The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely,” states the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>. Ironically, working at a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">healthy, sustainable pace</a> can be particularly challenging in an agile context: Product people have to regularly interact with development teams in order to update the product backlog, agree on sprint goals, answer questions, and provide feedback on product increments in addition to all the other product management duties. Being overworked, however, has a negative impact on our productivity and mental health. Luckily, there are a number of practical measures you can take to achieve sustainable pace. These include not covering other people jobs on a continued basis—like acting as a stand-in Scrum Master—and having the courage to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-saying-no-to-stakeholders/\">decline stakeholder requests</a>. Please see my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\">Sustainable Pace in Product Management</a>” for more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Looking into the Crystal Ball</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So where do we go from here? How will product management change over the next 20 years, and which role will agile methods play—if any?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without having a crystal ball at my disposal, I believe that the future of product management will be shaped by our ability to address the product management challenges mentioned above. I sincerely hope that in 20 years from now, empowerment will no longer be a significant issue, product roles will be better understood and more effectively applied, and product discovery and strategy will always be practiced by anybody who manages or owns a product. I also believe that agile methods will continue to enrich product management, alongside other influences that have emerged in the last few years including Lean Startup and business modelling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is still plenty of work to be done, I am optimistic about the future of product management and agile.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-agile-has-changed-product-management/\">How Agile Has Changed Product Management</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Once Upon a Time in Waterfall Land\nBefore the advent of agile frameworks like Scrum, a product person—the product manager—would typically carry out the market research, compile a market requirements specification, create a business case, put together product roadmap, write a requirements specification, and then hand it off to a project manager.

But it is less suited to create complex digital products.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDjkQxXw-2U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Brave New Agile World</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">collaborate much more closely</a>. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/think-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"553\">product-led approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early user feedback, frequent solution validation</strong>: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/beyond-product-demo-validation-techniques-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7876\">validate our ideas</a> and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced time-to-market</strong>: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a> that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better product quality and improved adaptability</strong>: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better requirements</strong>: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\">dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work</a> and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparent development progress</strong>: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">The progress is now based on working software</a> rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved alignment</strong>: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">sprint reviews</a>. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">involving them in the process of making product decisions</a> increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivated productive teams</strong>: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Old and New Product Management Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of empowerment</strong>: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-manager-vs-product-owner/\"><em>product owner</em> instead of <em>product manager</em></a> in order to emphasise the level of <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"12541\">authority and empowerment</a> a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confusion about roles and responsibilities</strong>: Even 20 years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> was conceived, agile roles like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">product owner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the <a href=\"https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scrum Guide</a> puts it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of direct interaction with users and customers</strong>: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">agile manifesto</a>. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13288\">empathise with the users and customers</a> and to fully understand their needs. This, in turn, reduces the chances of offering a product that does a great job for its target audience and generates the desired business benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Product discovery and product strategy poorly practiced</strong>: The most beautiful user stories are useless if it’s not clear who the users are and why they would want to use the product.

You might not want to disappoint John in the example above, you might worry that saying no will anger him and lead to conflict, or you might not want to be seen as a naysayer but somebody who has a can-do attitude and wants to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying no, however, is part and parcel of a product person’s job. If you said yes to every idea and request, you would end up with a <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adrenaline-Junkies-Template-Zombies-Understanding/dp/0932633676/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">feature soup</a></em>, a product with an uncompelling value proposition and a poor user experience. As Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe, however, that it would be impossible for you to say no to John, then this may indicate that you are not properly empowered, that you lack the authority and respect required to be in charge of the product and be responsible for its success. If that’s the case, explore how you can strengthen your product leadership. Refer to my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a>&#8221; for more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empathise with the Stakeholder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having decided that you can’t accept John’s request, you might be tempted to share your view with the individual and say, for instance: “Sorry, John. But there is no way that I can add the feature to the current release. The development team is struggling to implement the agreed features, and, as you know, we can’t push out the date.” This might seem like a reasonable answer: It’s direct and it offers an explanation. But would it be effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If John does not feel heard and understood, it will be hard for him to accept no as an answer, no matter how valid your arguments are. Instead, he might feel rejected and react with disappointment or anger. He might think that you don’t appreciate his views and don’t care about his needs. Consequently, John may no longer fully trust and support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this situation and maximise the chances that John can receive a no, empathise with the individual before you offer an answer. Find out why the feature is important to John. What is his personal, vested interest in getting the feature included in the release? Why does it matter to him? Only if John feels understood will he open up to your perspective, listen to your arguments, and accept that you can’t add the feature to the release. The following <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\">listening techniques</a> will help you with this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give your full attention to the individual. Maintain eye contact and show the person that you are interested in what she or he has to say.</li><li>Keep an <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/growth-mindset-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14188\">open mind</a> even if you disagree with what you are hearing or if you dislike the individual. Listen with the intention to understand, not to answer. John might be right, after all, and you should add the feature to the release.</li><li>Pay attention to the person’s body language. Non-verbal information—like voice pitch and volume, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movement—expresses the speaker’s feelings, which help you uncover the individual’s underlying interests.</li><li>Ask clarifying and probing questions to check that you have correctly understood what was said and encourage the other person to provide more information. You might say, for instance, “Can you please help me understand why adding the feature is important to you?”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reframe the Conversati<strong>on</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">Stakeholders</a> often request specific features without necessarily being fully aware of the problem it addresses. But value is hardly created by adding a single piece of functionality—at least as long as a product is young or changing. Instead of debating an individual feature with John, reframe the conversation. Explore which user or customer problem the functionality would help address. How would implementing the feature benefit these individuals? Why do some customers view it as crucial, to stay with the example above? And would there be an alternative way to achieve the desired impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if the feature is aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goal</a> of the current development effort, the outcome you want to achieve, for example, to enter a new market or to increase engagement. Will addressing the user problem help you meet this goal and create the desired benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then you should consider adapting the development effort. You may decide to add the feature to the release, assuming that you make appropriate adjustments like reducing or removing other features or moving the delivery date.

If the decision has a bigger impact, if you require other people’s input to make the right decision, or if you want to secure their buy-in, I recommend scheduling a meeting with all the key stakeholders and the development team representatives in order to discuss and evaluate the feature request and make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">joint decision</a>.

The dev team is struggling with the current workload, and moving the date is not an option.\nWhat’s more, you suspect that John’s request may be motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets. But John is a well-connected and influential individual who doesn’t like to be told that he is wrong. How can you decline his request without offending him and losing his support?\nYou can also access the content of this article on my YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t Feel Bad about Saying No\nDeclining a request can be hard. You might not want to disappoint John in the example above, you might worry that saying no will anger him and lead to conflict, or you might not want to be seen as a naysayer but somebody who has a can-do attitude and wants to help.\nSaying no, however, is part and parcel of a product person’s job. If you said yes to every idea and request, you would end up with a feature soup, a product with an uncompelling value proposition and a poor user experience. As Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.”\nIf you believe, however, that it would be impossible for you to say no to John, then this may indicate that you are not properly empowered, that you lack the authority and respect required to be in charge of the product and be responsible for its success. If that’s the case, explore how you can strengthen your product leadership. Refer to my article “Boost Your Product Leadership Power” for more guidance.\nEmpathise with the Stakeholder\nHaving decided that you can’t accept John’s request, you might be tempted to share your view with the individual and say, for instance: “Sorry, John. But there is no way that I can add the feature to the current release. The development team is struggling to implement the agreed features, and, as you know, we can’t push out the date.” This might seem like a reasonable answer: It’s direct and it offers an explanation. But would it be effective?\nIf John does not feel heard and understood, it will be hard for him to accept no as an answer, no matter how valid your arguments are. Instead, he might feel rejected and react with disappointment or anger. He might think that you don’t appreciate his views and don’t care about his needs. Consequently, John may no longer fully trust and support you.\nTo avoid this situation and maximise the chances that John can receive a no, empathise with the individual before you offer an answer. Find out why the feature is important to John. What is his personal, vested interest in getting the feature included in the release? Why does it matter to him? Only if John feels understood will he open up to your perspective, listen to your arguments, and accept that you can’t add the feature to the release. The following listening techniques will help you with this:\nGive your full attention to the individual. Maintain eye contact and show the person that you are interested in what she or he has to say.\nKeep an open mind even if you disagree with what you are hearing or if you dislike the individual. Listen with the intention to understand, not to answer. John might be right, after all, and you should add the feature to the release.\nPay attention to the person’s body language. Non-verbal information—like voice pitch and volume, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movement—expresses the speaker’s feelings, which help you uncover the individual’s underlying interests.\nAsk clarifying and probing questions to check that you have correctly understood what was said and encourage the other person to provide more information. You might say, for instance, “Can you please help me understand why adding the feature is important to you?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReframe the Conversation\nStakeholders often request specific features without necessarily being fully aware of the problem it addresses. But value is hardly created by adding a single piece of functionality—at least as long as a product is young or changing. Instead of debating an individual feature with John, reframe the conversation. Explore which user or customer problem the functionality would help address. How would implementing the feature benefit these individuals? Why do some customers view it as crucial, to stay with the example above? And would there be an alternative way to achieve the desired impact?\nAdditionally, consider if the feature is aligned with the product goal of the current development effort, the outcome you want to achieve, for example, to enter a new market or to increase engagement. Will addressing the user problem help you meet this goal and create the desired benefit?\nIf the answer is yes, then you should consider adapting the development effort. You may decide to add the feature to the release, assuming that you make appropriate adjustments like reducing or removing other features or moving the delivery date. But if the answer is no, then you should decline the request.\nDon’t Rush the Decision\nIt can be tempting to quickly make a decision just to be done with it. While you don’t want to procrastinate the decision, rushing it is usually a bad idea.\nSay that the conversation with John has turned difficult. He is adamant that the feature must be added, and he doesn’t want to accept your view. What’s more, he suggests that you don’t understand what the customers want, and he threatens to escalate the issue if you decline his request. In such a situation, it’s natural to feel difficult emotions like confusion, worry, and anger. \nWhen this happens, it’s best to pause the conversation and to postpone the decision to regain a cool head and allow the difficult feelings to subside. You might say to John, “It’s really important to me that we find a good solution. But I am feeling upset right now, and I need some time to reflect on what I heard you say. Let’s please continue the conversation in the afternoon.”\nAdditionally, consider if you can and should make the decision on your own. If the decision has a bigger impact, if you require other people’s input to make the right decision, or if you want to secure their buy-in, I recommend scheduling a meeting with all the key stakeholders and the development team representatives in order to discuss and evaluate the feature request and make a joint decision. You might even find that you need to run an experiment and collect relevant data, for instance, by interviewing users or releasing a feature fake, before you can make the decision.\nTry to Find Common Ground, but Don’t Split the Difference\nWhile saying no is sometimes unavoidable, I recommend that you explore if there is an alternative way to meet the stakeholder’s underlying need. Say that your suspicion turned out to be right: John’s request is, at least partly, motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets and claim a bonus.\nIf that’s the case, find out if you can help him achieve his goal without having to add the feature—assuming that you believe that it is right for you to help John pursue this goal. Would it be helpful, for example, to develop a sales pitch that shows that the product addresses some of the customer needs without providing the extra feature? Or is there another solution you can develop together with John?\nDon’t make the mistake, though, to simply split the difference and suggest to John that you will partially implement the feature as part of the current release—unless this would actually meet John’s underlying need and not sacrifice sustainable pace for the development team.\nDo what is necessary to maximise the value your product creates but don’t attempt to please individual stakeholders. Be kind and firm. Remember: Successful products are not built on weak compromises or the smallest common denominator.\nThe post 5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-saying-no-to-stakeholders/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-saying-no-to-stakeholders/\" title=\"5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-miguel-Ã¡-padriÃ±Ã¡n-1111368-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Saying no\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>Saying no is a firm part of our job as product people: Trying to please everyone and taking on board every idea is hardly a recipe for achieving product success.

An objective describes<em> what </em>is to be achieved. The key results state <em>how</em> we accomplish the objective. Let’s say, for example, that the objective is to “increase engagement.” The key results might then be “simplify user journey A” and “enhance feature alpha.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OKRs can be used to create cascading goals—goals that are systematically linked. This is done by using higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as the following example shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png\" alt=\"Sample Cascading OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16705\" width=\"666\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-300x71.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-768x183.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Cascading OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the key result “simplify user journey alpha” becomes an objective with two new key results, “remove user journey step two” and “improve performance by 10%” thereby connecting the two OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to note that OKRs were originally invented by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970ies to facilitate “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent execution</a>,” that is, to help people set hard, measurable goals and to be able to clearly determine if these have been met.

Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png\" alt=\"Cascading Product Management Goals\" class=\"wp-image-16704\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-768x476.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals. The <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">vision</a> guides the user and business goals, which are contained in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>.

A product goal, finally, helps determine the right <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision. (For a more detailed explanation of the goals above, please see my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">Leading through Shared Goals</a>,” and if you would like to learn more about goal setting in product management, then check out my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now explore how the goals in figure 2 can be captured as OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capturing Product-related Goals as OKRs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that I’d like to offer a product that helps people eat more healthily.

An objective describes<em> what </em>is to be achieved. The key results state <em>how</em> we accomplish the objective. Let’s say, for example, that the objective is to “increase engagement.” The key results might then be “simplify user journey A” and “enhance feature alpha.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OKRs can be used to create cascading goals—goals that are systematically linked. This is done by using higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as the following example shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png\" alt=\"Sample Cascading OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16705\" width=\"666\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-300x71.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-768x183.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Cascading OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the key result “simplify user journey alpha” becomes an objective with two new key results, “remove user journey step two” and “improve performance by 10%” thereby connecting the two OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to note that OKRs were originally invented by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970ies to facilitate “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent execution</a>,” that is, to help people set hard, measurable goals and to be able to clearly determine if these have been met. And that’s exactly how I experienced OKRs when I worked at Intel in the late 1990ies.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Goals in Product Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explain in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>, setting the right goals is crucial to align stakeholders and development teams and to achieve product success. Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png\" alt=\"Cascading Product Management Goals\" class=\"wp-image-16704\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-768x476.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals. The <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">vision</a> guides the user and business goals, which are contained in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>.

A product goal, finally, helps determine the right <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision. (For a more detailed explanation of the goals above, please see my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">Leading through Shared Goals</a>,” and if you would like to learn more about goal setting in product management, then check out my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now explore how the goals in figure 2 can be captured as OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capturing Product-related Goals as OKRs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that I’d like to offer a product that helps people eat more healthily.

For example, a product manager might determine the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/ten-product-backlog-tips/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1301\">product backlog</a>, the development work, and the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10199\">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle, Process Oly\" class=\"wp-image-16650\" width=\"512\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png 896w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-300x259.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-768x663.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14245\">extend the product’s life cycle</a>, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">too big and heterogenous</a>, the value proposition might <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">not be compelling enough</a>, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\">Strategize</a></em>. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to &#8220;Product Strategy&#8221; in the picture above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goals</a></em>. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog</a>. Then create just enough <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready product backlog items</a> to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-scrum-cycle/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3854\">best suited to create a new product or a major product update</a>, I&#8217;ve added another little cycle between &#8220;Product Backlog&#8221; and &#8220;Product&#8221; on the picture above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release burndown chart</a>. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance.

For example, a product manager might determine the product strategy and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.\nBased on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the product roadmap, the product backlog, the development work, and the key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n\n\n\nIn the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to extend the product’s life cycle, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals.\nBefore you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be too big and heterogenous, the value proposition might not be compelling enough, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book Strategize. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to “Product Strategy” in the picture above.\nOnce you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes product goals. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.\nWith an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog. Then create just enough ready product backlog items to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually best suited to create a new product or a major product update, I’ve added another little cycle between “Product Backlog” and “Product” on the picture above. \nAfter development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a release burndown chart. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are engagement, retention, product quality, team motivation, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, revenue and cost.\nUse the KPIs and the development progress data to review the product strategy and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to pivot, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.\nYou have now completed the cycle and started another one.\nInvolve the Right People\nSystematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.\nTo maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the key stakeholders and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and development progress, and updating the plans.

I have therefore placed a small cycle next to “Product Strategy” in the picture above.\nOnce you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes product goals. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.\nWith an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog. Then create just enough ready product backlog items to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually best suited to create a new product or a major product update, I’ve added another little cycle between “Product Backlog” and “Product” on the picture above. \nAfter development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a release burndown chart. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are engagement, retention, product quality, team motivation, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, revenue and cost.\nUse the KPIs and the development progress data to review the product strategy and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to pivot, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.\nYou have now completed the cycle and started another one.\nInvolve the Right People\nSystematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.\nTo maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the key stakeholders and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and development progress, and updating the plans. Inviting people to contribute to strategic decisions makes it more likely that they understand and support them.  What’s more, this allows you to leverage their expertise, which makes it more likely that you will make the right decisions. If you work on a larger product and in a scaled environment, include the product people who work with you, for example, the feature owners.\nA great way to engage the key stakeholders and development team members is to run a collaborative workshop, be it online or in the office. Ask your Scrum Master or another experienced facilitator to help prepare the workshop and facilitate the session. This includes establishing ground rules, selecting a helpful decision rule like consent, and ensuring that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. (You can find more advice on collaborative decision-making in my book How to Lead in Product Management.)\nInvolving the stakeholder and development team members in the decision-making process puts collaboration at the centre of the strategy cycle, as the picture below shows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n“All models are wrong, but some are useful,” as George Box once observed. Every model is an abstraction of reality. It therefore simplifies or ignores certain aspects and leaves out some details. This is also true for the process that I have described in this article. In reality, things are a little bit more complicated.\nThere are two aspects I’d like to draw your attention to: First, you should measure the development progress, as soon as the dev team has started to transform the product backlog items into a product increment. Once you have enough data to see a clear trend—which tends to be the case after two to three sprints—check if the product goal can be met on time and on budget. If that is not the case, then you might have to adjust the product roadmap, which might even trigger an adjustment of the product strategy. Similarly, if your product backlog experiences significant changes, as you find out, for instance, that a key feature is not required or has to be replaced, you should consider the impact on the product roadmap and update it as soon as possible.\nSecond, you should not forget to engage in continuous product discovery, which includes frequently monitoring new trends and the competition. As I have suggested before, spend at least half a day per week carrying out continuous discovery and strategy work including reviewing relevant trends and keeping an eye on the competition. This ensures that you do not miss any threats and opportunities and that you can respond to changes early rather than reacting to them with your back against the wall.\nThe post The Product Strategy Cycle appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-strategy-cycle/#respond","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-strategy-cycle/\" title=\"The Product Strategy Cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reid-zura-rSrK-P0Wips-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Spiral\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>Despite its importance, product strategy is not always effectively practiced.

This increases the chances of creating a product that users actually want and need and achieving product success. Carrying out product discovery involves answering the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the specific value the product should create for the users and customers? What problem should it solve, or which benefit should it create?</li><li>Which market and market segment should the product address? Who are the users and who are the customers?</li><li>What makes the product stand out? How will it differ from competing offerings?</li><li>What are its business goals? How will it benefit the company? For example, generate revenue or meet a profit margin, reduce cost, or develop the brand?</li><li>What business model will it use in order to achieve the business goals, including revenue sources, cost factors, and channels?</li><li>Will the product make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-ethics/\">positive impact on people’s lives, the wider society, and the planet, or will it at least not cause any harm</a>?</li><li>How might people use the product? What are the major touch points? What kind of user experience (UX) should the product give rise to?</li><li>How can the product be built? What architecture patterns and technologies may be used?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to answer the questions above, you may want to use techniques such as direct observation, user interviews, prototyping, creating a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">strategy canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>, and you may capture some of them using a tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a>. Whatever you do, I suggest that you follow Steve Blank’s advice and “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/\" target=\"_blank\">get out of the building</a>”. Meeting users and customers, at least in form of a video call, not only helps you validate your assumptions and develop new ideas. It also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\">empathise with the individuals</a> and to better understand their perspectives and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it helpful to distinguish two types of product discovery: timeboxed and continuous discovery. Let’s look at timeboxed product discovery first.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeboxed Product Di<strong>scovery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you create a brand-new product or when you make bigger changes to an existing one, like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\">taking it to a new market</a>, you will benefit from using a dedicated, timeboxed product discovery period. This results in an innovation process like the one shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png\" alt=\"product discovery vs product development\" class=\"wp-image-16536\" width=\"561\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-300x92.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-768x234.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development.png 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, product discovery precedes product development. The former focuses on understanding if and why a product should be created or updated. The latter largely determines how the product should be developed. This includes discovering the right UX design and functionality and making the right technical decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I have purposefully drawn discovery and development as overlapping, as I find it helpful to address major UX and technical risks as part of the discovery work—without making the mistake of using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front\" target=\"_blank\">big design upfront (BDU)</a>. Addressing these risks ensures that the development team has the right knowledge to hit the ground running <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8888\">when starting development</a>. Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> and business model,</li><li>Actionable <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a> that implements the strategy,</li><li>Initial product backlog that captures the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-lean-product-backlog-variation-and-overburden/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"591\">necessary product details</a>,</li><li>A high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\">spikes</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/discovery-and-strategizing-team-1024x489.png\" alt=\"Product Discovery Team\" class=\"wp-image-14741\" width=\"555\" height=\"262\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\">understand why the product is being created or updated</a>. The latter will <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution</a>. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision</a>, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Co</strong>ntinuous Product Discovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Review the product performance using the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\">key performance indicators</a>. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?</li><li>Look for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.</li><li>Keep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate?

And if so, what are the consequences for your product? </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, regularly hold <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">collaborative strategy reviews</a>, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb. Assess the product strategy and product roadmap together with development team representatives and key stakeholders. These are ideally the same people who participated in the timeboxed discovery work and who helped you create the current product strategy and roadmap. As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you manage a larger product and you work in a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\">scaled environment</a>, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature and component owners or SAFe product owners</a>, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\">A Brief Guide to Product Discovery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"What is Product Discovery?\nProduct discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why a product should be developed and offered.

As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.\nA Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment\nIf you manage a larger product and you work in a scaled environment, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, feature and component owners or SAFe product owners, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.\nIn addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.\nThe post A Brief Guide to Product Discovery appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" title=\"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/clark-tibbs-oqStl2L5oxI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"something great\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>When practiced correctly, product discovery maximises the chances of achieving product success.

This increases the chances of creating a product that users actually want and need and achieving product success. Carrying out product discovery involves answering the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the specific value the product should create for the users and customers? What problem should it solve, or which benefit should it create?</li><li>Which market and market segment should the product address? Who are the users and who are the customers?</li><li>What makes the product stand out? How will it differ from competing offerings?</li><li>What are its business goals? How will it benefit the company? For example, generate revenue or meet a profit margin, reduce cost, or develop the brand?</li><li>What business model will it use in order to achieve the business goals, including revenue sources, cost factors, and channels?</li><li>Will the product make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-ethics/\">positive impact on people’s lives, the wider society, and the planet, or will it at least not cause any harm</a>?</li><li>How might people use the product? What are the major touch points? What kind of user experience (UX) should the product give rise to?</li><li>How can the product be built? What architecture patterns and technologies may be used?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to answer the questions above, you may want to use techniques such as direct observation, user interviews, prototyping, creating a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">strategy canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>, and you may capture some of them using a tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a>. Whatever you do, I suggest that you follow Steve Blank’s advice and “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/\" target=\"_blank\">get out of the building</a>”. Meeting users and customers, at least in form of a video call, not only helps you validate your assumptions and develop new ideas. It also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\">empathise with the individuals</a> and to better understand their perspectives and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it helpful to distinguish two types of product discovery: timeboxed and continuous discovery. Let’s look at timeboxed product discovery first.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeboxed Product Di<strong>scovery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you create a brand-new product or when you make bigger changes to an existing one, like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\">taking it to a new market</a>, you will benefit from using a dedicated, timeboxed product discovery period. This results in an innovation process like the one shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png\" alt=\"product discovery vs product development\" class=\"wp-image-16536\" width=\"561\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-300x92.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-768x234.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development.png 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, product discovery precedes product development. The former focuses on understanding if and why a product should be created or updated. The latter largely determines how the product should be developed. This includes discovering the right UX design and functionality and making the right technical decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I have purposefully drawn discovery and development as overlapping, as I find it helpful to address major UX and technical risks as part of the discovery work—without making the mistake of using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front\" target=\"_blank\">big design upfront (BDU)</a>. Addressing these risks ensures that the development team has the right knowledge to hit the ground running <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8888\">when starting development</a>. Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> and business model,</li><li>Actionable <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a> that implements the strategy,</li><li>Initial product backlog that captures the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-lean-product-backlog-variation-and-overburden/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"591\">necessary product details</a>,</li><li>A high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\">spikes</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/discovery-and-strategizing-team-1024x489.png\" alt=\"Product Discovery Team\" class=\"wp-image-14741\" width=\"555\" height=\"262\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\">understand why the product is being created or updated</a>. The latter will <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution</a>. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision</a>, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Co</strong>ntinuous Product Discovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Review the product performance using the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\">key performance indicators</a>. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?</li><li>Look for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.</li><li>Keep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate? Job postings can help you guess your competitors’ plans. Reviewing their products will tell you <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">if your product is still sufficiently differentiated</a>.</li><li>Follow the developments at your own company: Are there any changes to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/business-strategy-and-product-strategy/\">business strategy</a>? And if so, what are the consequences for your product? </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, regularly hold <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">collaborative strategy reviews</a>, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb.

This allows the stakeholders to voice their ideas and concerns, and it makes it more likely that they understand and support important product decisions. \nIf you plan to decide together with the stakeholders, then invite them to a meeting. Carefully prepare the session and choose a decision rule, for instance, consent. Additionally, ask your Scrum Master or another skilled facilitator to help run the meeting so that everyone is heard, and nobody dominates. (I offer more advice on securing stakeholder buy-in and decision-making in my book How to Lead in Product Management.)\nStep 4: Prioritise the remaining product backlog items\nNow prioritise the remaining product backlog items. I recommend that you prioritise a new or significantly changed product backlog initially by risk, taking into account the user, technology, and business-related risks. Assess all backlog items together with the development team and move those to the top that carry the highest risk. This approach accelerates learning and it avoids failing late when there are less options to change course. \nFinally, ensure that the high-priority items are “ready“, that the development team and you have a shared understanding of them, that the team can implement them in the next sprint, and that they are testable.\nThe Moral of the Story\nYou might be wondering what was up with the healthcare product I mentioned earlier. The prioritisation difficulties were indeed rooted in the lack of a clear and agreed product strategy and the absence of a clear, focused goal for the initial version. Consequently, the offering launched was more like a maximum viable product than a minimum one. Unsurprisingly, it pretty much bombed, which resulted in the company losing significant market share and people leaving the enterprise. \nAs this story shows, it is crucial to have an overall product strategy in place before you decide which functionality your product should offer and in which order it should be implemented. In other words, make sure that you create an effective product strategy first before you worry about the product details and that you systematically connect the product backlog to the strategy.\nThe post Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/#comments","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/\" title=\"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrishna-flickr-e1590504925764-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ducks in a row\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>The product backlog is an essential product management tool: It captures detailed product decisions and directs the work of the development team.

Think of the vision as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html\" target=\"_blank\">big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)</a> that inspires people and offers a continuity of purpose for the next five to ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\">8 Tips for Creating A Compelling Product Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Target Group is (too) Big and Heterogenous</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Everyone who owns a smartphone”, “Business users and consumers”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A very big and diverse target group makes it hard to formulate a crisp, compelling value proposition and strong standout features. It can also result in a large product backlog and high development cost: The greater the number of people who should benefit from your product is, the more diverse their needs are likely to be, and the more features are usually required to address them. Trying to offer a product that pleases everybody carries the risk of not doing a good job for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: A lack of understanding of users and their needs, lack of empowerment of the person in charge of the product, inappropriate growth strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Successful products are not built by agreeing on the smallest common denominator or trying to please powerful stakeholders. Instead, they require tough strategic decision and clear focus. Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank suggested</a>, particularly when you manage a new or young product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams</a>: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/market-segmentation-tips-for-product-managers/\">Market Segmentation Tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 59; <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 36.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor.

Additionally, such a vision is hardly inspiring. A good vision exercises pull—it describes a future state that people want to bring about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong>: A confusion about what an effective product vision is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Describe the ultimate purpose of your product, the positive change the product should bring about like “healthy eating”. Think of the vision as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html\" target=\"_blank\">big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)</a> that inspires people and offers a continuity of purpose for the next five to ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\">8 Tips for Creating A Compelling Product Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Target Group is (too) Big and Heterogenous</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Everyone who owns a smartphone”, “Business users and consumers”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A very big and diverse target group makes it hard to formulate a crisp, compelling value proposition and strong standout features. It can also result in a large product backlog and high development cost: The greater the number of people who should benefit from your product is, the more diverse their needs are likely to be, and the more features are usually required to address them. Trying to offer a product that pleases everybody carries the risk of not doing a good job for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: A lack of understanding of users and their needs, lack of empowerment of the person in charge of the product, inappropriate growth strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Successful products are not built by agreeing on the smallest common denominator or trying to please powerful stakeholders. Instead, they require tough strategic decision and clear focus. Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank suggested</a>, particularly when you manage a new or young product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams</a>: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/market-segmentation-tips-for-product-managers/\">Market Segmentation Tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 59; <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 36.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor. Consequently, it will be hard to achieve the desired business benefits and monetise the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of understanding what problems users really face and what they really need; a target group that is too large and heterogenous, as discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the main reason for people to use the product, the primary benefit that the product should offer to the users or the main problem it should address. Another approach is to identify the main goal users will want to achieve by using the product or to find the primary job the product should do for them. Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order get to know the users, empathise with the individuals, and develop a thorough understanding of their needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 94, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs are Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy to use, calorie counter, works on iOS and Android”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When features—in the sense of product capabilities—are mistaken for needs, it is not clear why people should use the product, and the offering is likely to suffer from having a poor, unconvincing value proposition. Additionally, there is too much focus on the solution (“solutionising”), which is likely to limit the development team’s ability to come up with the best possible design and architecture options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Confusion about what a need is; a lack of understanding of the user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the <em>why</em>: Ask why people would want to use the product. What specific benefit will it offer, or which problem will it help solve? Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews. Additionally, describe the needs from the users’ perspective, for example, “help me achieve a healthy target weight” or “help me significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">What is a Digital Product: Section “Features and Components”</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs Statement is not Specific</strong> Enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Get fit&#8221;, &#8220;Feel better&#8221;, &#8220;Improve eating habits”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: It’s perfectly fine to start out with a broad needs statement.

Iterate over the product vision board and refine its contents, similar to how you would refine the product backlog and break bigger items into more specific ones. For instance, if getting fit is the desired benefit, then a refined and more specific needs statement might be “be able to run 10k”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 66.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>No Convincing Standout Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy-to-use user interface, calorie intake, barcode scanner”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Standout features ensure that your product is effectively differentiated: As their name suggests, they make your product stand out from the crowd, they give people a reason to choose it over competing offerings. If the features are weak, it will not be clear to prospective users why they should favour your product over alternatives, and it will be hard to market and sell the offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of market insight, lack of empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: To address the first cause, perform competitor research and apply a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">Strategy Canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>.

If that’s not possible, stop and carry out just enough market and user research to be able to create a testable board. Then start the validation work by choosing the biggest risk and address it, for example, by observing users or building a prototype.\nMore Information: Product Discovery Tips, Working with the Product Vision Board, Strategize, pp. 86.\nThe post Common Product Vision Board Mistakes appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/#respond","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" title=\"Common Product Vision Board Mistakes\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a-man-in-red-shirt-covering-his-face-3760043-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Mistake\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>The product vision board is a simple yet powerful tool to capture the product vision and the product strategy.
