Depending on where you live, you pay between 1-2% of your salary to the Swedish church.\n\nYou're allowed to leave, but they don't make it easy. It's a great business they've got going:\n- Acquisition costs are 0 - you become a member automatically upon birth\n- Most members are unaware that they are paying - it's not talked about a lot\n- Recurring revenue - a 1-2% royalty on productivity of millions of people...\n- It's hard to opt-out - why would they make it easy to stop giving them money?\n\nThe church asks you to print out a form (that's hard to find), sign with a blue pen (wtf?) and send to the congregation you belong to (which one do I belong to??).\n\nThey make it hard. We make it easy.\n\n\nWhy did we build this?\n-----------------------------------------------\nLeaving the church is free, but it's a lot of work to figure out how to do it. Over 20k people search every month about this, with little information to find.\n\nThere's a few scammy sites out there that \"help\". They're often based in tax havens, charge WAY too much and don't deliver what they promise.\n\nWe figured we could make things easy for the customer and make a small margin in the process.\n\n\n\n► We Need YOU 🤜 💥 🤛\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI'd love some feedback on the layout of the site.

Similar to Linktree, Clubhouse began as a free, purpose-driven tool aimed at helping people create their own space to share ideas, innovate, and connect. \n\nIt’s only fitting to be rolling out Linktree’s latest link-detection features that gives users the ability to customize and share details about events and rooms on their Linktree page. This ultimately will increase your Clubhouse engagement and build your following directly from Linktree. \n\nWe're excited to rollout 5 new features:\n- Direct your followers to your latest Clubhouse Event so visitors can see what topics you’ll discuss, who is hosting and what time it starts!\n- Promote your impromptu Clubhouse Room via your Linktree\n- Grow your club through sending your visitors to your Club with a Club Link that displays important info like club interests and follower count\n- Promote your profile by adding a link to your profile\n- Grow your following with a Clubhouse Social Icon\n\nFor now, PRO users can utilize the scheduling feature to set the start and end time of Clubhouse links so you can have the link disappear as the event is done. For all users, we will automatically convert the date and time of your event to the visitor's timezone. \n\nLinktree’s Clubhouse links are available to all our users - free and PRO. Check out https://linktr.ee/LTClubhouse and don’t forget to join our Linktree club on Clubhouse to hear about new product features, what’s trending on social media and tips on how to optimise your online presence.

Here the competitions are quite different.\n\n- It's a community-funded data science tournament.\n- We run short-term tournaments\n- The competitions go through playoffs, with: quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals.\n- Each of this stages has different dataset releases, under the same ML problem. This faithfully simulates the input of new real data, and the improvement of the model (via re-training) based on them. It also keeps the excitement high, as no one has their position completely won!\n- In the playoffs you will compete head-to-head against other randomly picked data scientist (in the quarterfinals), and then the best of each bracket will compete against each other.\n- All backers/participants win something very valuable: the winner's ML models in a Jupyter Notebook\n- We choose exciting and unique ML problems to solve\n- We guarantee the transparency of the competition by giving the winner's models to all participants and publishing the actual values (of the datasets) at the end of each stage\n- The prize pool will be distributed as follows: 50% to the winner, 30% to the second place and 20% to the third place.\n\n\nWhat do you think of the idea? We love feedback and would be happy to hear from you.\n\nReady to get an adrenaline rush and show what you know?

Each purchase comes with a step by step guide on how to create it. This is a no experience needed process. Once you have a CAD you just need to email it to a caster to cast it into the metal of your choice (ex. 14kt gold). Once its finished you then need to take it to a polisher to finish it. The cost for doing all of this independently is 100% cheaper than buying from jewelry store. Another reason to independently make your jewelry is you receive better quality jewelry because your selecting the exact type of material you want behind the scenes rather than trusting a jeweler to give you a specific type of diamonds or metal.\n        &#8221;\n        <br>\n        – Tevar Johnson\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jewelry-cad-market?utm_campaign=producthunt-atom-posts-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss-feed&amp;utm_source=producthunt-atom-posts-feed\">Discussion</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/r/f36bc60799b8cd/296594?app_id=339\">Link</a>\n      </p>\n","contentSnippet":"Discussion\n        |\n        Link","id":"tag:www.producthunt.com,2005:Post/296594","isoDate":"2021-05-20T11:33:01.000Z"},{"title":"Ulmo E-Commerce UI Kit — High-quality kit to help create a beautiful e-commerce app","link":"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ulmo-e-commerce-ui-kit","pubDate":"2021-05-20T11:09:49.000Z","author":"Roman Belyaev","content":"      <p>\n        &#8220;\n        Hey, Guys!\nI'm Roman, and I want to share with you my first UI kit.\nI am open to all comments, so post here or at UI8.\n\nCheers!\n        &#8221;\n        <br>\n        – Roman Belyaev\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ulmo-e-commerce-ui-kit?utm_campaign=producthunt-atom-posts-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss-feed&amp;utm_source=producthunt-atom-posts-feed\">Discussion</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/r/597d8b18d8b8bf/296592?app_id=339\">Link</a>\n      </p>\n","contentSnippet":"Discussion\n        |\n        Link","id":"tag:www.producthunt.com,2005:Post/296592","isoDate":"2021-05-20T11:09:49.000Z"},{"title":"Post Uploader for Instagram — Upload post to Instagram from your PC","link":"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/post-uploader-for-instagram","pubDate":"2021-05-20T10:28:40.000Z","author":"Thomas MacGibbon","content":"      <p>\n        &#8220;\n        Functionality:\n⭐️ Upload Instagram photos and videos.
