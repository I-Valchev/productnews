But Rambachan thinks it will take a cultural shift for larger lenders. The idea makes a lot of sense to the data science crowd, he says. Yet when he talks to those teams inside banks they admit it’s not a mainstream view. “They&#8217;ll sigh and say there&#8217;s no way they can explain it to the business team,” he says. “And I&#8217;m not sure what the solution to that is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blattner also thinks that credit scores should be supplemented with other data about applicants, such as bank transactions.

I usually do french press at home, but its just too much effort for me to clean. So, nothing wrong with giving the infamous Aeropress a try — its relatively cheap, the review says it makes good coffee, and most importantly easy to clean. The day it arrived at my house, I don’t really bother that much because I don’t want to learn a new way of making coffee. A couple of weeks past and I decided to try Aeropress over the weekend.</p><p>Oh boy, how surprised I am with this little device. I’m literally shocked to taste something new in my regular cup of coffee — you know, the feeling when you buy a new set of headphones and you can hear that new instrument in an old song.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9WaumA2MR98LvSs4\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@goran_ivos?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Goran Ivos</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>“How can this little plastic thing make such a different cup compared to the french press? Why? How? How??”</blockquote><p>So like most average people, I embark on a journey to search the holy God of Internet for the answer. After some few hours of searching in my most productive times — 2AM in the morning — I found some answers. Aeropress uses paper filter, which blocks the fine coffee residue and the oils from entering the cup, thus makes the taste cleaner and brighter. Coffee oil if not filtered makes the cup bolder and heavier, some people prefer that, but for me, I like a cleaner cup to be able to taste the exciting subtle flavors of the coffee itself. Additionally, using the Aeropress will only take somewhere around 2:00–2:30 minutes of brewing time, which limits the coffee contact with water, therefore not over extracting the coffee beans. This will limit the chemicals in the coffee like quinic acid and furfuryl alcohol from getting extracted which makes the coffee bitter. It turns out, its never as simple as <em>coffee + water = cup of coffee</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*HuZM5AX4qaNTv1GCC4bdiQ.png\" /></figure><p>Aeropress with pre-ground coffee is just the beginning — it makes a nice good consistent cup of coffee. So now, armed with a good hand grinder and the will power to hand-ground my coffee every time, the next few years is experimenting with various brewing methods — V60, Wave Dripper, Moka Pot, Chemex, Turkish, etc. With all the tools that I had, I started to do weekend experiments on brewing coffee. Essentially, coffee brewers need to find the right extraction point — where the water extract the right amount of complex flavor compounds in the coffee. Under-extracting will create a bland and sour taste, while over-extracting will create just a bitter and boring cup with no complex flavors.</p><p>Over time, I have a fondness for V60 pour-over method since I can control every aspect of the brewing process. Depending on the pouring method, the result can be very different. The same beans, same grind, same water temperature, with a different pouring method, can create a different taste. If we break it down, brewing with V60 has 5 measurable variables:</p><ol><li><strong>Coffee beans</strong>: <em>Pretty self-explanatory. Depending on the freshness and origin of the beans, the coffee will taste different. Good coffee beans can have a nutty, flowery, and fruity taste when fully extracted.</em></li><li><strong>Grind size</strong>: <em>In a pour-over, this essentially will be determining how long the water is in contact with the coffee. A coarser ground will make the water flow faster while a finer ground will be the opposite. Grind size also affects the extraction rate, finer ground will increase the overall surface area and creating a higher extraction rate. The theory is that the higher the extraction rate, the less time it needs for the water to be in contact with the coffee.</em></li><li><strong>Water temperature</strong>: <em>The hotter the water, the faster coffee will extract. For a lighter roast, we use a hotter temperature to speed up the extraction process. For a darker roast, its the opposite.</em></li><li><strong>Coffee ratio</strong>: <em>This is very important to achieve a well-extracted coffee. Too much coffee will lead to an under-extraction. The golden ratio for pour-over is usually somewhere around 1:16 grams coffee to water ratio, give or take 10% depending on the preference.</em></li><li><strong>Pouring method</strong>: <em>Now this alone has many variables inside. How fast you pour the water, when you pour the water, how you bloom (the process of releasing the carbon dioxide gas in the coffee when you first pour in the water), how you agitate, and so on.</em></li></ol><p>From there, we can try to play around with the variables to get a great cup of coffee. If you are curious enough, try to under or over-extract the coffee a bit. Try to do it the wrong way, so you can appreciate it more if it is done the right way. When you try to play around with it, you will get a sense of how a great coffee should be like (I’ll post my go-to method down below).</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*jIl3tigqAmJNfxW25NdYqQ.jpeg\" /></figure><p>When you can brew a great cup of coffee, next would be how to improve it further. So then, I purchased some higher-end tools: a more accurate coffee scale, more stable kettle, a more consistent grinder, and many coffee gears to improve my brew. I spent quite some time in trying to improve or just to see what more can I get out of my coffee. Somehow, despite many upgrades, the coffee quality doesn’t really improve that much — <em>certainly not as much as what I spent</em>. This is the point where I stop investing more in trying to make a better cup of coffee and be satisfied with what I have. In fact, I sold some of it and only keep the basic ones.</p><h3>So what do I learn?</h3><p>Just like making a better coffee, when we want to improve on anything, we need to be strategic with the steps that we take. We cannot expect to improve by doing the same thing over and over again. So here is what I learn by making coffee:</p><ol><li><strong>Create a framework and identify the variables</strong><br><em>Before approaching any problem that you want to solve, you need to identify the variables affecting it. Having this will structurize your way of thinking and how you approach it. It will make your thinking more tactical in the sense that you will expect the outcome to change only when you change the variables. Having some kind of scoring system works too. For example, if you want to buy something, try to identify what features are important, what are nice to have, and give some scoring or weighing into it— try to also answers ‘why’ is it important or not.</em></li><li><strong>When problem solving, focus on one variable at a time<br></strong><em>Now when we already identify the variables that are at play, we can create experiments to see how it affects the outcome. Changing only one variable at a time will allow us to know exactly the quantum of that variable change. Throughout my working experience, I encountered people doing testing and changing multiple variables at a time. When there is an obvious effect on the outcome, we don’t know which variable causes it and by how much. In the end, we need to redo the testing.</em></li><li><strong>Timing is everything<br></strong><em>Just like brewing coffee, time is very essential in work and life. Time is a finite resource and you need to prioritize how much time you should spend on something. Spending too little time is not good, but being stuck on something is also not good either. I always ask myself, do spending time in this satisfy my personal value? Does it bring me closer to my goal? You need to know when to invest in time and when to stop and move on.</em></li><li><strong>You can’t please everyone<br></strong><em>Coffee is a matter of preference. We can taste the difference between good and great coffee, but improvements from there will be depending on individual preference. I have a small community with people that love coffee and we often review and exchange coffee beans. We can all appreciate high quality beans that have a great taste profile, but it&#39;s hard for us to agree on which one we like the most. No matter how exotic the beans or how it is carefully roasted, in the end, it all depends on preference. So when developing something, we have to focus on our target market and do the best for them — we can’t please everyone, and that’s okay. This reminds me of a trip to Kyoto and visited the Kurasu cafe (a world champion brewer). To my surprise, the coffee they make is somehow not my favorite. I mean, it’s still a great cup, even better than great, but somehow not my favorite.</em></li><li><strong>Do what you love <br></strong><em>I like brewing coffee in V60 or Kalita, it makes a great cup. But when I’m traveling, I stick with my Aeropress with pre-ground coffee for the sake of simplicity — it still makes a consistently good cup, in fact still better from most generic coffee shops. Even with my love for coffee, making a great one is not everything. There are things that you personally value that you prioritize more — simplicity in traveling for example (yes, I really hate to travel heavy that much). There will be people saying that I spend too much time and money on coffee, there will also be people saying that I will not produce a consistent coffee with the tools that I have.

I usually do french press at home, but its just too much effort for me to clean. So, nothing wrong with giving the infamous Aeropress a try — its relatively cheap, the review says it makes good coffee, and most importantly easy to clean. The day it arrived at my house, I don’t really bother that much because I don’t want to learn a new way of making coffee. A couple of weeks past and I decided to try Aeropress over the weekend.\nOh boy, how surprised I am with this little device. I’m literally shocked to taste something new in my regular cup of coffee — you know, the feeling when you buy a new set of headphones and you can hear that new instrument in an old song.\nPhoto by Goran Ivos on Unsplash\n“How can this little plastic thing make such a different cup compared to the french press? Why? How? How??”\nSo like most average people, I embark on a journey to search the holy God of Internet for the answer. After some few hours of searching in my most productive times — 2AM in the morning — I found some answers. Aeropress uses paper filter, which blocks the fine coffee residue and the oils from entering the cup, thus makes the taste cleaner and brighter. Coffee oil if not filtered makes the cup bolder and heavier, some people prefer that, but for me, I like a cleaner cup to be able to taste the exciting subtle flavors of the coffee itself. Additionally, using the Aeropress will only take somewhere around 2:00–2:30 minutes of brewing time, which limits the coffee contact with water, therefore not over extracting the coffee beans. This will limit the chemicals in the coffee like quinic acid and furfuryl alcohol from getting extracted which makes the coffee bitter. It turns out, its never as simple as coffee + water = cup of coffee.\n\nAeropress with pre-ground coffee is just the beginning — it makes a nice good consistent cup of coffee. So now, armed with a good hand grinder and the will power to hand-ground my coffee every time, the next few years is experimenting with various brewing methods — V60, Wave Dripper, Moka Pot, Chemex, Turkish, etc. With all the tools that I had, I started to do weekend experiments on brewing coffee. Essentially, coffee brewers need to find the right extraction point — where the water extract the right amount of complex flavor compounds in the coffee. Under-extracting will create a bland and sour taste, while over-extracting will create just a bitter and boring cup with no complex flavors.\nOver time, I have a fondness for V60 pour-over method since I can control every aspect of the brewing process. Depending on the pouring method, the result can be very different. The same beans, same grind, same water temperature, with a different pouring method, can create a different taste. If we break it down, brewing with V60 has 5 measurable variables:\n\nCoffee beans: Pretty self-explanatory. Depending on the freshness and origin of the beans, the coffee will taste different. Good coffee beans can have a nutty, flowery, and fruity taste when fully extracted.\nGrind size: In a pour-over, this essentially will be determining how long the water is in contact with the coffee. A coarser ground will make the water flow faster while a finer ground will be the opposite. Grind size also affects the extraction rate, finer ground will increase the overall surface area and creating a higher extraction rate. The theory is that the higher the extraction rate, the less time it needs for the water to be in contact with the coffee.\nWater temperature: The hotter the water, the faster coffee will extract. For a lighter roast, we use a hotter temperature to speed up the extraction process. For a darker roast, its the opposite.\nCoffee ratio: This is very important to achieve a well-extracted coffee. Too much coffee will lead to an under-extraction. The golden ratio for pour-over is usually somewhere around 1:16 grams coffee to water ratio, give or take 10% depending on the preference.\nPouring method: Now this alone has many variables inside. How fast you pour the water, when you pour the water, how you bloom (the process of releasing the carbon dioxide gas in the coffee when you first pour in the water), how you agitate, and so on.\n\nFrom there, we can try to play around with the variables to get a great cup of coffee. If you are curious enough, try to under or over-extract the coffee a bit. Try to do it the wrong way, so you can appreciate it more if it is done the right way. When you try to play around with it, you will get a sense of how a great coffee should be like (I’ll post my go-to method down below).\n\nWhen you can brew a great cup of coffee, next would be how to improve it further. So then, I purchased some higher-end tools: a more accurate coffee scale, more stable kettle, a more consistent grinder, and many coffee gears to improve my brew. I spent quite some time in trying to improve or just to see what more can I get out of my coffee. Somehow, despite many upgrades, the coffee quality doesn’t really improve that much — certainly not as much as what I spent. This is the point where I stop investing more in trying to make a better cup of coffee and be satisfied with what I have. In fact, I sold some of it and only keep the basic ones.\nSo what do I learn?\nJust like making a better coffee, when we want to improve on anything, we need to be strategic with the steps that we take. We cannot expect to improve by doing the same thing over and over again. So here is what I learn by making coffee:\n\nCreate a framework and identify the variables\nBefore approaching any problem that you want to solve, you need to identify the variables affecting it. Having this will structurize your way of thinking and how you approach it. It will make your thinking more tactical in the sense that you will expect the outcome to change only when you change the variables. Having some kind of scoring system works too. For example, if you want to buy something, try to identify what features are important, what are nice to have, and give some scoring or weighing into it— try to also answers ‘why’ is it important or not.\nWhen problem solving, focus on one variable at a time\nNow when we already identify the variables that are at play, we can create experiments to see how it affects the outcome. Changing only one variable at a time will allow us to know exactly the quantum of that variable change. Throughout my working experience, I encountered people doing testing and changing multiple variables at a time. When there is an obvious effect on the outcome, we don’t know which variable causes it and by how much. In the end, we need to redo the testing.\nTiming is everything\nJust like brewing coffee, time is very essential in work and life. Time is a finite resource and you need to prioritize how much time you should spend on something. Spending too little time is not good, but being stuck on something is also not good either. I always ask myself, do spending time in this satisfy my personal value? Does it bring me closer to my goal? You need to know when to invest in time and when to stop and move on.\nYou can’t please everyone\nCoffee is a matter of preference. We can taste the difference between good and great coffee, but improvements from there will be depending on individual preference. I have a small community with people that love coffee and we often review and exchange coffee beans. We can all appreciate high quality beans that have a great taste profile, but it's hard for us to agree on which one we like the most. No matter how exotic the beans or how it is carefully roasted, in the end, it all depends on preference. So when developing something, we have to focus on our target market and do the best for them — we can’t please everyone, and that’s okay. This reminds me of a trip to Kyoto and visited the Kurasu cafe (a world champion brewer). To my surprise, the coffee they make is somehow not my favorite. I mean, it’s still a great cup, even better than great, but somehow not my favorite.\nDo what you love \nI like brewing coffee in V60 or Kalita, it makes a great cup. But when I’m traveling, I stick with my Aeropress with pre-ground coffee for the sake of simplicity — it still makes a consistently good cup, in fact still better from most generic coffee shops. Even with my love for coffee, making a great one is not everything. There are things that you personally value that you prioritize more — simplicity in traveling for example (yes, I really hate to travel heavy that much). There will be people saying that I spend too much time and money on coffee, there will also be people saying that I will not produce a consistent coffee with the tools that I have. No matter what you do, there will be people judging and criticizing. Don’t let that get into you and keep doing what you think is best. Only you know your priority in life.\n\nSo there you go. Brewing coffee changed the way I look into my work and my personal life. It might be the caffeine speaking, but I feel that brewing coffee teach me valuable life lessons more than I could expect.\nEasy V60 Recipe:\n15 grams medium-fine grind coffee, 250 grams water, 92–95C water (or around 30 seconds off the boil)\nSteps:\n\nRinse paper filter and fill the V60 with coffee ground\nPour 30 grams of water in 15 seconds, then swirl\nLet it bloom for 30 seconds\nPour 120 grams of water in 30 seconds — your V60 should be about full at this stage\nGently swirl to knock off the grounds from the side.\nPour 100 grams of water in 30 seconds\nAim to finish by around 75 seconds +/- 15 seconds\nTotal brew time is around 3 minutes\nAdjust grind size if brew time is not within 3 minutes mark\n\nHow Coffee Brewing Help Me to Become a Better Human — in Work and in Life was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Sebastian Yaphy","guid":"https://medium.com/p/df036f743a75","categories":["productivity","self-improvement","personal-development","product-management","coffee"],"isoDate":"2021-06-17T08:08:32.000Z"},{"creator":"Njikwe","title":"3 Time Management Mindset Traps That Crush Your Content Creation","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/3-time-management-mindset-traps-that-crush-your-content-creation-e1b29a2e9538?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 06:32:46 GMT","dc:creator":"Njikwe","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/3-time-management-mindset-traps-that-crush-your-content-creation-e1b29a2e9538?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*VyVEdcJFgt9h1fPMAzhKaQ.jpeg\" width=\"4592\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">And how to avoid them</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/3-time-management-mindset-traps-that-crush-your-content-creation-e1b29a2e9538?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\">Continue reading on The Startup »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"And how to avoid them\nContinue reading on The Startup »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/e1b29a2e9538","categories":["psychology","time-management","content-creation","entrepreneur","productivity"],"isoDate":"2021-06-17T06:32:46.000Z"},{"creator":"Eliza Beth","title":"The Power of ‘Free’ in Increasing Online Sales","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-free-in-increasing-online-sales-afa3a2fa8e00?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 03:47:37 GMT","dc:creator":"Eliza Beth","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-free-in-increasing-online-sales-afa3a2fa8e00?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*-1Yj2hU79nmBAfEEWPhDLQ.jpeg\" width=\"3121\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">&#x201C;The more you divide, the more it yields dividends.

No, it’s not going to be little green men speeding through space in flying disks—more likely microbes or primitive bacteria. But a discovery like that would nevertheless be a sign that we are not alone in the universe—that life elsewhere is a possibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we going to find that life? It was once thought the solar system was probably a barren wasteland apart from Earth. Rocky neighbors were too dry and cold like Mars, or too hot and hellish like Venus. The other planets were gas giants, and life on those worlds or their satellite moons was basically inconceivable. Earth seemed to be a miracle of a miracle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But life isn’t that simple. We now know that life on Earth is able to thrive in even the harshest, most brutal environments, in super cold and super dry conditions, depths of unimaginable pressures, and without the need to use sunlight as a source of energy. At the same time, our cursory understanding of these obscure worlds has expanded tremendously. Our rocky neighbors of Venus and Mars may have once been temperate and Earth-like, and some of the life might have lingered on after these planets’ climates took a turn for the worse. Several of the icy moons that hang around Jupiter and Saturn might have underground oceans that could sustain life. A couple may even have atmospheres. And still other places that seem to be too exotic for life continue to surprise us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the myriad of new exoplanets we’re identifying every year, when it comes to worlds in the solar system, we have the ability to send probes to these places and study them directly. “We can measure things that would be impossible to measure with telescopes,” says David Catling, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington. They could study things up close, maybe fly into the atmosphere or land on the surface, and perhaps one day even bring back samples that could reveal whether these planets and moons are home to materials or fossils that are evidence of life—or perhaps life itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the 10 best places in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life, subjectively ranked by yours truly for how likely we are to find life—and how easy it would be to find it if it’s there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s3-1280.jpg?w=1280\" alt=\"triton\" class=\"wp-image-1026487\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s3-1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s3-1280.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s3-1280.jpg?resize=768,432 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">NASA</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>10. Triton</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Triton is the largest moon of Neptune, and one of the most exotic worlds in the solar system. It’s one of only five moons in the solar system known to be geologically active, as evidenced by its active geysers that spew sublimated nitrogen gas. Its surface is mostly frozen nitrogen, and its crust is made of water ice, and it has an icy mantle. Yes, this is a cold, cold world. But in spite of that, it seems to get some heat generated by tidal forces (gravitational friction between Triton and Neptune), and that could help warm up the waters and give rise to life through any organics that might exist on the moon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually finding life on Triton seems like a very distant possibility. The only mission to ever visit the world was Voyager 2 in 1989. The window for such a mission opens up only every 13 years. The best opportunity to visit Triton would be the proposed Trident mission (which seems unlikely to get launched after NASA just greenlighted <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/02/1025660/nasa-venus-davici-plus-veritas/\">two new missions to Venus</a>&nbsp;later this decade). And lastly, the horrendous cold tempers hopes that life could stay unfrozen for long enough to make a home for itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22381131691_57aef79584_o.png?w=1000\" alt=\"ceres\" class=\"wp-image-1026486\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22381131691_57aef79584_o.png 1000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22381131691_57aef79584_o.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22381131691_57aef79584_o.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22381131691_57aef79584_o.png?resize=768,768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">NASA / JPL-CALTECH / UCLA / MPS / DLR / IDA / JUSTIN COWART</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>9. Ceres</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The largest asteroid and smallest dwarf planet in the solar system could be home to liquid water, sitting deep underground. Ceres, a dwarf planet that sits between Mars and Jupiter, was studied by NASA’s Dawn probe from orbit from 2015 to 2018. Scientists are still unpacking and analyzing that data, but tantalizing studies in the past few years <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/11/1006447/ceres-largest-asteroid-dwarf-planet-underground-ocean-salty-water/\">suggest there’s an ocean sitting 25 miles below the surface</a>, and could stretch for hundreds of miles. It would almost certainly be extremely salty—which would keep the water from freezing even well below 0°C. Dawn even found evidence of organic compounds on Ceres that could act as raw materials for life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ceres ranks second-to-last on our list because its habitability has too many questions attached. The evidence of subsurface water and the organic materials is still very new. Even if those things are there, it would need some source of heat and energy that could actually help encourage that water and organic material to react in such a way that it leads to life. And even if&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;occurred, finding that life means we have to drill at least two-dozen miles into the ground to access that water and study it. Lastly, Ceres is tiny—more than 13 times smaller than Earth. It’s not yet clear how that fraction of gravity could affect life on the dwarf planet, but if Earth is our compass for what’s habitable, Ceres’s small size is probably not an asset. There’s no shortage of new proposals for future missions to study the dwarf planet, including ones that would even attempt <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Exploration%20of%20Ceres%20Habitability.pdf\">a sample return mission</a>. But nothing is going up soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43_PIA01667.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"io\" class=\"wp-image-1026485\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43_PIA01667.jpg 800w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43_PIA01667.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43_PIA01667.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43_PIA01667.jpg?resize=768,768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">NASA/JPL/UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>8. Io</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Boasting over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active world in the solar system. All of that activity is thought to be caused by tidal heating created as Io’s interior is gravitationally pulled between Jupiter and the other Jovian moons. The volcanism results in a huge coating of sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost (yes, that’s a thing!) across the globe, along with a super thin sulfur dioxide atmosphere. There might even be a subsurface ocean on Io, but it would be made of magma, not water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life on Io is very unlikely. But all that heat is a bit of an encouraging sign.

Those prospects ignited last year when researchers <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/14/1008373/gas-phosphine-spotted-in-venus-clouds-atmosphere-could-be-sign-of-biological-life/\">detected phosphine gas in very thick Venusian atmosphere</a>.

But this and other work that’s explored Venus’s history of water have renewed a lot of great interest into the idea that Venus may have once been habitable, and might still be.

And NASA’s found evidence of hydrothermal activity deep underground, which could very well provide a source of heat that’s necessary to give life a chance to evolve and thrive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, Enceladus ought to be higher up my list than Titan, were it not for the fact that there just simply isn’t any mission on the books right now to study it. Plenty of proposals have been debated for the last several years, including several under NASA. All are geared toward an astrobiological investigation that would look more closely for signs that Enceladus is habitable to life. While digging underground into the ocean would be the most surefire way to determine whether the moon is home to life, we might also catch a lucky break and be able to detect biosignatures that have been spewed up by the moon’s cryovolcanoes (volcanos that erupt vaporized materials like water or ammonia rather than molten rock).

Mars</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Mars takes the top spot for several reasons. We know it was once habitable billions of years ago, when it had lakes and rivers of liquid water on its surface. We know it had a robust atmosphere back then to keep things warm and comfy. And we currently have a rover on the surface, Perseverance, whose express goal is to look for signs of ancient life. It will even secure samples that we’ll one day bring back to Earth to study in the lab.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does that have to do with finding&nbsp;<em>current</em>&nbsp;life? Well, if there are signs of ancient life, it’s possible life on Mars still exists. Probably not on the surface, but maybe underground. There have already been a few big studies that have used radar observations to show that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/28/1008958/there-might-be-even-more-underground-reservoirs-of-liquid-water-on-mars/\">reservoirs of liquid water probably exist a couple kilometers below the surface</a>. We’ve found bacteria on Earth surviving in similar conditions, so it’s entirely possible something is living in those parts of Mars as well. Getting down there will be insanely difficult, but if we have reason to believe something is lurking in these reservoirs, it’ll be all hands on deck to figure out how we can get there and see for ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"If you want to believe, now is the time: the hope that we might one day stumble upon alien life is greater than it ever was. No, it’s not going to be little green men speeding through space in flying disks—more likely microbes or primitive bacteria. But a discovery like that would nevertheless be a sign that we are not alone in the universe—that life elsewhere is a possibility. \nWhere are we going to find that life? It was once thought the solar system was probably a barren wasteland apart from Earth. Rocky neighbors were too dry and cold like Mars, or too hot and hellish like Venus. The other planets were gas giants, and life on those worlds or their satellite moons was basically inconceivable. Earth seemed to be a miracle of a miracle.\nBut life isn’t that simple. We now know that life on Earth is able to thrive in even the harshest, most brutal environments, in super cold and super dry conditions, depths of unimaginable pressures, and without the need to use sunlight as a source of energy. At the same time, our cursory understanding of these obscure worlds has expanded tremendously. Our rocky neighbors of Venus and Mars may have once been temperate and Earth-like, and some of the life might have lingered on after these planets’ climates took a turn for the worse. Several of the icy moons that hang around Jupiter and Saturn might have underground oceans that could sustain life. A couple may even have atmospheres. And still other places that seem to be too exotic for life continue to surprise us. \nUnlike the myriad of new exoplanets we’re identifying every year, when it comes to worlds in the solar system, we have the ability to send probes to these places and study them directly. “We can measure things that would be impossible to measure with telescopes,” says David Catling, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington. They could study things up close, maybe fly into the atmosphere or land on the surface, and perhaps one day even bring back samples that could reveal whether these planets and moons are home to materials or fossils that are evidence of life—or perhaps life itself. \nHere are the 10 best places in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life, subjectively ranked by yours truly for how likely we are to find life—and how easy it would be to find it if it’s there. \n\nNASA\n10. Triton\nTriton is the largest moon of Neptune, and one of the most exotic worlds in the solar system. It’s one of only five moons in the solar system known to be geologically active, as evidenced by its active geysers that spew sublimated nitrogen gas. Its surface is mostly frozen nitrogen, and its crust is made of water ice, and it has an icy mantle. Yes, this is a cold, cold world. But in spite of that, it seems to get some heat generated by tidal forces (gravitational friction between Triton and Neptune), and that could help warm up the waters and give rise to life through any organics that might exist on the moon. \nBut actually finding life on Triton seems like a very distant possibility. The only mission to ever visit the world was Voyager 2 in 1989. The window for such a mission opens up only every 13 years. The best opportunity to visit Triton would be the proposed Trident mission (which seems unlikely to get launched after NASA just greenlighted two new missions to Venus later this decade). And lastly, the horrendous cold tempers hopes that life could stay unfrozen for long enough to make a home for itself.  \n\nNASA / JPL-CALTECH / UCLA / MPS / DLR / IDA / JUSTIN COWART\n9. Ceres\nThe largest asteroid and smallest dwarf planet in the solar system could be home to liquid water, sitting deep underground. Ceres, a dwarf planet that sits between Mars and Jupiter, was studied by NASA’s Dawn probe from orbit from 2015 to 2018. Scientists are still unpacking and analyzing that data, but tantalizing studies in the past few years suggest there’s an ocean sitting 25 miles below the surface, and could stretch for hundreds of miles. It would almost certainly be extremely salty—which would keep the water from freezing even well below 0°C. Dawn even found evidence of organic compounds on Ceres that could act as raw materials for life. \nBut Ceres ranks second-to-last on our list because its habitability has too many questions attached. The evidence of subsurface water and the organic materials is still very new. Even if those things are there, it would need some source of heat and energy that could actually help encourage that water and organic material to react in such a way that it leads to life. And even if that occurred, finding that life means we have to drill at least two-dozen miles into the ground to access that water and study it. Lastly, Ceres is tiny—more than 13 times smaller than Earth. It’s not yet clear how that fraction of gravity could affect life on the dwarf planet, but if Earth is our compass for what’s habitable, Ceres’s small size is probably not an asset. There’s no shortage of new proposals for future missions to study the dwarf planet, including ones that would even attempt a sample return mission. But nothing is going up soon.\n\nNASA/JPL/UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA\n8. Io\nBoasting over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active world in the solar system. All of that activity is thought to be caused by tidal heating created as Io’s interior is gravitationally pulled between Jupiter and the other Jovian moons. The volcanism results in a huge coating of sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost (yes, that’s a thing!) across the globe, along with a super thin sulfur dioxide atmosphere. There might even be a subsurface ocean on Io, but it would be made of magma, not water.\nLife on Io is very unlikely. But all that heat is a bit of an encouraging sign. There may be locations on the surface or underground that aren’t overwhelmed by the volcanic activity—more temperate places where hardy forms of life have found a way to survive. We wouldn’t be able to study those spots directly, but a probe might be able to find evidence of life if it gets lucky. \nThat’s easier said than done. The best chance of studying Io is through a proposed NASA mission called Io Volcano Observer (IVO), which if approved would launch in 2029 and do ten flybys of Io.

Well, if there are signs of ancient life, it’s possible life on Mars still exists. Probably not on the surface, but maybe underground. There have already been a few big studies that have used radar observations to show that reservoirs of liquid water probably exist a couple kilometers below the surface. We’ve found bacteria on Earth surviving in similar conditions, so it’s entirely possible something is living in those parts of Mars as well. Getting down there will be insanely difficult, but if we have reason to believe something is lurking in these reservoirs, it’ll be all hands on deck to figure out how we can get there and see for ourselves.","dc:creator":"Neel V.

Yet, this is often understood as e.g., backend &#038; front-end developers working together. If an organization is aiming for company-wide agility, to fully benefit from agility it has to enable teams as value centers that are truly cross-functional by bringing in different perspectives from business, markets, cultures, beliefs etc. This way cross-functional teams overcome not only the limitations of organizational silos but also of a singular view on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too many products have been developed that serve one kind of client only.

Yet, this is often understood as e.g., backend & front-end developers working together. If an organization is aiming for company-wide agility, to fully benefit from agility it has to enable teams as value centers that are truly cross-functional by bringing in different perspectives from business, markets, cultures, beliefs etc. This way cross-functional teams overcome not only the limitations of organizational silos but also of a singular view on the market.\n\r\n\r\nToo many products have been developed that serve one kind of client only. The reason is that the composition of the teams leads (subconsciously) to the development of products that serve only people that resemble the people in the team. One “famous” example is the soap dispenser that only works if your hands are white.\n\r\n\r\nIf teams are really cross-functional and are resembling the diversity of the market, the products they’re creating are also better. Thus, if the whole team has the full business expertise, knows the market, reflects the full diversity of the clients, then it can even disrupt the market and isn’t waiting for some person (e.g., the Product Owner) to decide on priorities. With this real cross-functionality the team can fully understand the company’s business and has a holistic view of it, knowing its contribution to the company’s value stream.\n\r\n\r\nReal cross-functional teams are an essential building block for implementing company-wide agility and the organization benefits by creating better and in a way more real products and by having more options when entering the war of talent.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n \r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about Jutta Eckstein\n\r\n\r\nJutta Eckstein works as an independent coach, consultant, and trainer.

These systems promised to slow the disease’s spread by providing automated warnings to people who came into contact with the virus. Now, over a year later, residents in over <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/16/1014878/covid-tracing-tracker/\">50 countries</a>—including half of US states—can opt into these systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the big question remains: how well did this technology work? <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/11/1018010/uk-exposure-notification-contact-tracing-app-succes/\">Some studies suggest answers</a>, but despite such wide rollout, it’s difficult to evaluate whether exposure notifications were actually able to stall covid-19 spread. This is especially true in the US, where many states launched their own apps—a decentralized approach that reflects America’s fragmented pandemic response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to learn more about how this technology fared in the US, MIT Technology Review reached out to every state public health department that launched a digital contact tracing system and examined app reviews left by anonymous Americans. We asked two questions: who is actually using this technology, and how do people feel about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end result of this analysis paints a picture of unexplored potential. Many of the country’s exposure notification apps are underutilized, misunderstood, and not well-trusted—and yet this technology may yet come into its own as a public health tool for future disease outbreaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How the technology works</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Exposure notifications were first put forward as a complement to traditional contact tracing. Under the traditional manual approach, investigators looking for people who may have been infected ask patients to trace their whereabouts and activities through phone calls and interviews. The new technology promised to scale to cover entire populations automatically rather than just small disease clusters— a distinct advantage for tracking a fast-spreading disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might remember the friend you met for lunch, for example, but not the stranger you stood next to in line for 15 minutes at the grocery store. An exposure notification system does the remembering for you, anonymously using Bluetooth to keep a log of nearby phones and alerting you if one of those phones is associated with a positive test result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first wave of this system was designed by cooperatives of developers, most of whom ended up collaborating with Apple and Google to create a uniform standard. The Apple-Google system prioritized privacy for users, anonymizing their data, and did not track users locations. With the backing of the world’s two most dominant phone platforms, this system is the one that’s been most widely adopted, and is used by the vast majority of US states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effectiveness of these systems has been notoriously hard to evaluate. Studies are just now starting to come out about <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z\">apps in the UK</a> and <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779376\">Switzerland</a>, for example. In the US, evaluation is made even harder by the fact that every state is basically doing its own thing. But our analysis does have a few takeaways:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>US systems were launched relatively late in the pandemic—when the country’s fall/winter surge was mostly already in progress</li><li>The technology has not been widely adopted, though some states are faring better than others</li><li>A lack of public trust in new technology—coupled with a lack of resources in the public health agencies peddling that technology—hampered both adoption rates and how people used the systems</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Who’s using this tech</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We tracked exposure notification apps that had been rolled out in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Virginia was the first state to make the technology publicly available to its residents in August 2020, while others are still only getting started now. Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2021/04/05/massachusetts-covid-tracing-app-massnotify\">began testing its app with a pilot in two cities</a> in April 2021, while South Carolina is currently running a pilot program at Clemson University. The state actually started work on its system back in May 2020—but legislators <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/musc-dhec-had-plans-for-an-sc-contact-tracing-app-privacy-concerns-have-delayed-it/article_de6729f0-2d99-11eb-a917-ff253b719ac2.html\">barred the public health department</a> from any digital contact tracing work last summer due to privacy concerns, holding back development.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe title=\"Exposure notification activation status by state\" aria-label=\"Map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-L2KlV\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/L2KlV/4/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"562\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\n</script>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the states where such apps are available, not everybody can use them. Exposure notifications are only available for smartphone users; and about <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/\">15% of Americans don’t have a smartphone</a>, according to Pew Research Center. Still, over half of the US population can now get plugged in. Whether they choose to join those systems is another matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the vast majority of states do not publicly report user data, we reached out to state public health departments directly to ask how many people had opted into the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty-four states and DC shared user estimates, showing that, by early May, a total 36.7 million Americans have opted in to the notifications. Hawaii has the highest share of its population covered, at about 46%. In four more states, more than 30% of residents opted in: Connecticut, Maryland, Colorado, and Nevada. Seven more states have over 15% of their populations covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That proportion is important: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00422-7\">modeling studies</a> have determined that if roughly 15% of a population opts into the system, it could significantly reduce a community’s covid case numbers, hospitalizations, and deaths. By this metric, 13 states—which together represent about one-third of the US population—have seen some degree of protection thanks to exposure notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe title=\"Share of population with exposure notifications activated\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-evnjk\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/evnjk/4/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"756\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\n</script>\n\n\n\n<p>The remaining 11 states with exposure notification apps fail to meet this benchmark for success. Of those 11, three states have under 5% of their populations covered: Arizona, North Dakota, and Wyoming. South Dakota, the one state which did not respond to a press request, shares use of the Care19 Diary app with the low-activation states of North Dakota and Wyoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing states isn’t perfect, though, because there are no federal standards guiding how states collect or report the data—and some may make very different choices to others. For example, while DC reports an “exposure notification opt-in” number on its <a href=\"https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/reopening-metrics\">Reopening Metrics page</a>, this number is actually higher than its residential population. A representative of DC Health explained that the opt-in number includes tourists and people who work in DC, even if they reside elsewhere. For our purposes, we looked at DC’s activation rate as a share of the surrounding metropolitan area’s population (including parts of nearby Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason these rates are hard to measure: Several of the states with higher usage rates benefit from a major upgrade that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410281/apple-google-coronavirus-exposure-notification-contact-tracing-app-system\">Apple and Google released in September</a>: Exposure Notification Express, or ENX. This framework made it much faster for states to spin up apps, and it also invited millions of iPhone users to avoid downloading anything at all. They could activate the notifications simply by flipping a switch in their phone settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ENX activation is much more convenient, and experts say it may seem safer than downloading a new app. It has seriously boosted activation rates for states that use it. Hawaii, for example, saw its users <a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/02/15/breaking-news/covid-19-app-that-warns-of-hawaii-exposure-now-available-for-older-iphones/\">more than double </a>from February to May while rolling out ENX.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The express system does mean we have less precise user data, though. States aren’t able to track ENX activations directly, and instead need to rely on Apple for their numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Beyond the numbers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when a lot of residents have downloaded an app or turned that switch in their iPhone settings, the system still needs to be properly used in order to make a difference in covid cases. So we tried to understand how people were using the systems, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779953\">recent study</a> found that Americans were hesitant to trust digital contact tracing technology. However, this finding was based on surveys conducted before most states even launched their apps. As a proxy for public attitudes towards the US state apps, MIT Technology Review scraped and analyzed app reviews from the Google Play store. We only looked at Google Play reviews (from Android users) to get the most current and consistent data. (Most iPhone users can now turn on notifications without downloading an app.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at app reviews isn’t a perfect system. Users who chose to review their state’s app are not a representative sample of the EN-activating population—instead, they are those users who want to share strong opinions about the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, here’s what we found:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Most of the state apps have average ratings between 3 and 4.</li><li>Michigan has the lowest score, at 2.6.</li><li>D.C, California, New York, Delaware, and Massachusetts have the highest scores, over 4.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<iframe title=\"Exposure notification app ratings\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-GuYBD\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GuYBD/4/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"377\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\n</script>\n\n\n\n<p>Many 1-star reviewers appeared to misunderstand how their state’s app works, didn’t trust in the technology, or were unable to understand how the app fit into the broader public health system. This indicates that, for many Americans, the app wasn’t doing its job even though it was technically in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Lessons from negative reviews</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor reviews provide a glimpse into common issues and misconceptions that the digital contact tracing system faced.<br><br><strong>Small glitches made a big difference</strong>.<br>Over and over, reviewers stated that they got tripped up by needing an activation code. To help protect privacy, when you test positive for covid you don’t input your name or other identifying details into the app: instead, you enter a string of numbers that your public health department gives you. Some reviewers state that they don’t know where to get an activation code after testing positive, or that they ran into error messages. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/19/1025041/england-nhs-vaccine-passports-worldwide/\">We’ve heard from developers in other countries about this issue</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some US states and other countries have streamlined the process by automating how a code gets sent, but in many cases, users must wait for a contact tracer to call them. This waiting period can decrease trust in the technology, and it significantly slows down digital contact tracing.<br><br><strong>“Trust” isn’t just about the app itself. It’s broader than that.</strong><br>Many app reviewers also mistrust new technology, the government, or both. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/30/key-findings-about-americans-views-on-covid-19-contact-tracing/\">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted in July 2020 found that 41% of Americans would likely not speak with a public health official on the phone or via text message, and 27% said they would not be comfortable sharing the names of recent contacts—both key elements of the contact tracing process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital contact tracing faces similar challenges. Some reviewers felt so strongly about protecting their privacy that they came to their state app’s pages in order to boast about their refusal to download this technology. Many echoed the sentiments of this reviewer from Pennsylvania: “Open access to my wifi, GPS, and Bluetooth? Creepy. No thanks, Harrisburg.”<br><br><strong>Low usage creates a downward spiral of mistrust.</strong><br>One crucial aspect of digital contact tracing is that you need participation for it to work—at least 15% of the community, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/05/1002775/covid-apps-effective-at-less-than-60-percent-download/\">but preferably much higher</a>. When people aren’t participating, the chance of getting a match is lower—even if covid levels are high—and so the system likely won’t send out alerts to those small number of people who <em>do</em> have exposure notifications activated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few reviews went as far as to beg the other residents of their states to opt into exposure notifications, reminding fellow reviewers that higher usage leads to higher effectiveness in a tone that seemed more reminiscent of a Facebook argument than an app store.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This may have been confusing for essential workers or other frontline staff who knew for a fact that they were being exposed. People who opted into the system hoping for protection—only to get silence—may have been discouraged into thinking the technology simply doesn’t work at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one New Jersey reviewer who claimed to work in an emergency room expressed frustration at how they “hadn’t been alerted once” even after direct contact with covid-19 patients. Those who felt like their app wasn’t working may have discouraged others from downloading it—when in fact more users was exactly what was needed for the system to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Lessons from positive reviewers&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What about reviews that rated apps highly? Here’s what we found:<br><br><strong>Trust continues to be a big issue</strong>.<br>Positive app reviewers tried to combat mistrust with explanations and endorsements. Most of the state apps, in fact, have more five-star ratings than any other category—an encouraging signal that thousands of Americans were willing to give the technology a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Many people are trying to do the public health system’s job</strong>. <br>Some of these positive reviewers identified themselves as experts in the tech space, such as software engineers and security analysts. They posted explanations about how the digital contact tracing system works and reassurances that no, this app will not share your location with the government.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>One security expert from Colorado wrote, “Please, please. Use this app. Control the spread.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One security expert from Colorado wrote, “Please, please. Use this app. Control the spread.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these efforts may seem heartwarming, such reviews mask a more fundamental problem: it should be public health authorities doing the trust-building, not random commenters. And they should have the resources to do it in a more effective forum than the Google Play store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public health agencies lacked resources</strong>.<br>These reviews—both positive and negative—show that public health systems faced a lot of pressure to get it right. But in actuality, state health agencies could only do so much with the budgets and capacity that they had. Public health workers in New Jersey, for example, said they relied on a free marketing toolkit and ad space provided by Google. While the agency did work with county health departments and social media for more targeted advertising, its efforts were limited because most workers had to deal with other facets of the covid response at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe that getting buy-in from communities for any new technology requires deep investment,” says Pardis Sabeti, a computational geneticist at Harvard and MIT who has developed covid-19 apps for higher education institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One criticism of these systems in the US is that they were a patchwork without federal leadership. However, when implemented correctly, patchworks can be successful. Some experts have suggested tying apps to trusted institutions to build what experts have called <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/12/1012033/why-people-dont-trust-contact-tracing-apps-and-what-to-do-about-it/\">“the piecemeal creation of public trust”</a>—gaining trust in one local community at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sabeti’s work may be an example of this strategy in action. On campuses, her team has engaged with students and other community members to test covid-related digital tools in small settings, before they’re released to the broader student body. The process requires “constant communication between the individuals using [the tool] and the developers, elements that empower every actor in the system, and education throughout, so that communities understand how to use the available tools wisely.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-term investment is especially difficult for US state public health departments, which were <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/tag/underfunded-and-under-threat/\">underfunded for decades before the pandemic</a>. “Public health authorities have not been able to sustain the messaging over time in terms of attracting people to download the app,” says Jenny Wanger, who runs programs on covid technology for Linux Foundation Public Health, a software development network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of trust-building is especially important for marginalized communities, who have many legitimate reasons to distrust the government.

These systems promised to slow the disease’s spread by providing automated warnings to people who came into contact with the virus. Now, over a year later, residents in over 50 countries—including half of US states—can opt into these systems.\nBut the big question remains: how well did this technology work? Some studies suggest answers, but despite such wide rollout, it’s difficult to evaluate whether exposure notifications were actually able to stall covid-19 spread. This is especially true in the US, where many states launched their own apps—a decentralized approach that reflects America’s fragmented pandemic response.\nIn an attempt to learn more about how this technology fared in the US, MIT Technology Review reached out to every state public health department that launched a digital contact tracing system and examined app reviews left by anonymous Americans. We asked two questions: who is actually using this technology, and how do people feel about it?\nThe end result of this analysis paints a picture of unexplored potential. Many of the country’s exposure notification apps are underutilized, misunderstood, and not well-trusted—and yet this technology may yet come into its own as a public health tool for future disease outbreaks.\nHow the technology works\nExposure notifications were first put forward as a complement to traditional contact tracing. Under the traditional manual approach, investigators looking for people who may have been infected ask patients to trace their whereabouts and activities through phone calls and interviews. The new technology promised to scale to cover entire populations automatically rather than just small disease clusters— a distinct advantage for tracking a fast-spreading disease.\nYou might remember the friend you met for lunch, for example, but not the stranger you stood next to in line for 15 minutes at the grocery store. An exposure notification system does the remembering for you, anonymously using Bluetooth to keep a log of nearby phones and alerting you if one of those phones is associated with a positive test result.\nThe first wave of this system was designed by cooperatives of developers, most of whom ended up collaborating with Apple and Google to create a uniform standard. The Apple-Google system prioritized privacy for users, anonymizing their data, and did not track users locations. With the backing of the world’s two most dominant phone platforms, this system is the one that’s been most widely adopted, and is used by the vast majority of US states. \nThe effectiveness of these systems has been notoriously hard to evaluate. Studies are just now starting to come out about apps in the UK and Switzerland, for example. In the US, evaluation is made even harder by the fact that every state is basically doing its own thing. But our analysis does have a few takeaways: \nUS systems were launched relatively late in the pandemic—when the country’s fall/winter surge was mostly already in progress\nThe technology has not been widely adopted, though some states are faring better than others\nA lack of public trust in new technology—coupled with a lack of resources in the public health agencies peddling that technology—hampered both adoption rates and how people used the systems\n\n\n\n\nWho’s using this tech\nWe tracked exposure notification apps that had been rolled out in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Virginia was the first state to make the technology publicly available to its residents in August 2020, while others are still only getting started now. Massachusetts began testing its app with a pilot in two cities in April 2021, while South Carolina is currently running a pilot program at Clemson University. The state actually started work on its system back in May 2020—but legislators barred the public health department from any digital contact tracing work last summer due to privacy concerns, holding back development.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\nEven in the states where such apps are available, not everybody can use them. Exposure notifications are only available for smartphone users; and about 15% of Americans don’t have a smartphone, according to Pew Research Center. Still, over half of the US population can now get plugged in. Whether they choose to join those systems is another matter.\nAs the vast majority of states do not publicly report user data, we reached out to state public health departments directly to ask how many people had opted into the technology.\nTwenty-four states and DC shared user estimates, showing that, by early May, a total 36.7 million Americans have opted in to the notifications. Hawaii has the highest share of its population covered, at about 46%. In four more states, more than 30% of residents opted in: Connecticut, Maryland, Colorado, and Nevada. Seven more states have over 15% of their populations covered.\nThat proportion is important: modeling studies have determined that if roughly 15% of a population opts into the system, it could significantly reduce a community’s covid case numbers, hospitalizations, and deaths. By this metric, 13 states—which together represent about one-third of the US population—have seen some degree of protection thanks to exposure notifications.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\nThe remaining 11 states with exposure notification apps fail to meet this benchmark for success. Of those 11, three states have under 5% of their populations covered: Arizona, North Dakota, and Wyoming. South Dakota, the one state which did not respond to a press request, shares use of the Care19 Diary app with the low-activation states of North Dakota and Wyoming.\nComparing states isn’t perfect, though, because there are no federal standards guiding how states collect or report the data—and some may make very different choices to others. For example, while DC reports an “exposure notification opt-in” number on its Reopening Metrics page, this number is actually higher than its residential population. A representative of DC Health explained that the opt-in number includes tourists and people who work in DC, even if they reside elsewhere. For our purposes, we looked at DC’s activation rate as a share of the surrounding metropolitan area’s population (including parts of nearby Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia).\nAnother reason these rates are hard to measure: Several of the states with higher usage rates benefit from a major upgrade that Apple and Google released in September: Exposure Notification Express, or ENX. This framework made it much faster for states to spin up apps, and it also invited millions of iPhone users to avoid downloading anything at all. They could activate the notifications simply by flipping a switch in their phone settings.\nENX activation is much more convenient, and experts say it may seem safer than downloading a new app. It has seriously boosted activation rates for states that use it. Hawaii, for example, saw its users more than double from February to May while rolling out ENX. \nThe express system does mean we have less precise user data, though. States aren’t able to track ENX activations directly, and instead need to rely on Apple for their numbers.\nBeyond the numbers\nEven when a lot of residents have downloaded an app or turned that switch in their iPhone settings, the system still needs to be properly used in order to make a difference in covid cases. So we tried to understand how people were using the systems, too. \nA recent study found that Americans were hesitant to trust digital contact tracing technology. However, this finding was based on surveys conducted before most states even launched their apps. As a proxy for public attitudes towards the US state apps, MIT Technology Review scraped and analyzed app reviews from the Google Play store. We only looked at Google Play reviews (from Android users) to get the most current and consistent data. (Most iPhone users can now turn on notifications without downloading an app.)\nLooking at app reviews isn’t a perfect system. Users who chose to review their state’s app are not a representative sample of the EN-activating population—instead, they are those users who want to share strong opinions about the technology.\nStill, here’s what we found: \nMost of the state apps have average ratings between 3 and 4.\nMichigan has the lowest score, at 2.6.\nD.C, California, New York, Delaware, and Massachusetts have the highest scores, over 4. \n\n\n\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\nMany 1-star reviewers appeared to misunderstand how their state’s app works, didn’t trust in the technology, or were unable to understand how the app fit into the broader public health system. This indicates that, for many Americans, the app wasn’t doing its job even though it was technically in use.\nLessons from negative reviews\nPoor reviews provide a glimpse into common issues and misconceptions that the digital contact tracing system faced.\nSmall glitches made a big difference.\nOver and over, reviewers stated that they got tripped up by needing an activation code. To help protect privacy, when you test positive for covid you don’t input your name or other identifying details into the app: instead, you enter a string of numbers that your public health department gives you. Some reviewers state that they don’t know where to get an activation code after testing positive, or that they ran into error messages. We’ve heard from developers in other countries about this issue.\nSome US states and other countries have streamlined the process by automating how a code gets sent, but in many cases, users must wait for a contact tracer to call them. This waiting period can decrease trust in the technology, and it significantly slows down digital contact tracing.\n“Trust” isn’t just about the app itself. It’s broader than that.\nMany app reviewers also mistrust new technology, the government, or both. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in July 2020 found that 41% of Americans would likely not speak with a public health official on the phone or via text message, and 27% said they would not be comfortable sharing the names of recent contacts—both key elements of the contact tracing process. \nDigital contact tracing faces similar challenges. Some reviewers felt so strongly about protecting their privacy that they came to their state app’s pages in order to boast about their refusal to download this technology. Many echoed the sentiments of this reviewer from Pennsylvania: “Open access to my wifi, GPS, and Bluetooth? Creepy. No thanks, Harrisburg.”\nLow usage creates a downward spiral of mistrust.\nOne crucial aspect of digital contact tracing is that you need participation for it to work—at least 15% of the community, but preferably much higher. When people aren’t participating, the chance of getting a match is lower—even if covid levels are high—and so the system likely won’t send out alerts to those small number of people who do have exposure notifications activated.\nA few reviews went as far as to beg the other residents of their states to opt into exposure notifications, reminding fellow reviewers that higher usage leads to higher effectiveness in a tone that seemed more reminiscent of a Facebook argument than an app store.\nThis may have been confusing for essential workers or other frontline staff who knew for a fact that they were being exposed. People who opted into the system hoping for protection—only to get silence—may have been discouraged into thinking the technology simply doesn’t work at all. \nFor example, one New Jersey reviewer who claimed to work in an emergency room expressed frustration at how they “hadn’t been alerted once” even after direct contact with covid-19 patients. Those who felt like their app wasn’t working may have discouraged others from downloading it—when in fact more users was exactly what was needed for the system to be successful.\nLessons from positive reviewers \nWhat about reviews that rated apps highly? Here’s what we found:\nTrust continues to be a big issue.\nPositive app reviewers tried to combat mistrust with explanations and endorsements. Most of the state apps, in fact, have more five-star ratings than any other category—an encouraging signal that thousands of Americans were willing to give the technology a try.\nMany people are trying to do the public health system’s job. \nSome of these positive reviewers identified themselves as experts in the tech space, such as software engineers and security analysts. They posted explanations about how the digital contact tracing system works and reassurances that no, this app will not share your location with the government.\n\nOne security expert from Colorado wrote, “Please, please. Use this app. Control the spread.”\n\n\n\n\nOne security expert from Colorado wrote, “Please, please. Use this app. Control the spread.”\nWhile these efforts may seem heartwarming, such reviews mask a more fundamental problem: it should be public health authorities doing the trust-building, not random commenters. And they should have the resources to do it in a more effective forum than the Google Play store.\nPublic health agencies lacked resources.\nThese reviews—both positive and negative—show that public health systems faced a lot of pressure to get it right. But in actuality, state health agencies could only do so much with the budgets and capacity that they had. Public health workers in New Jersey, for example, said they relied on a free marketing toolkit and ad space provided by Google. While the agency did work with county health departments and social media for more targeted advertising, its efforts were limited because most workers had to deal with other facets of the covid response at the same time.\n“I believe that getting buy-in from communities for any new technology requires deep investment,” says Pardis Sabeti, a computational geneticist at Harvard and MIT who has developed covid-19 apps for higher education institutions. \nOne criticism of these systems in the US is that they were a patchwork without federal leadership. However, when implemented correctly, patchworks can be successful. Some experts have suggested tying apps to trusted institutions to build what experts have called “the piecemeal creation of public trust”—gaining trust in one local community at a time.\nSabeti’s work may be an example of this strategy in action. On campuses, her team has engaged with students and other community members to test covid-related digital tools in small settings, before they’re released to the broader student body. The process requires “constant communication between the individuals using [the tool] and the developers, elements that empower every actor in the system, and education throughout, so that communities understand how to use the available tools wisely.”\nLong-term investment is especially difficult for US state public health departments, which were underfunded for decades before the pandemic. “Public health authorities have not been able to sustain the messaging over time in terms of attracting people to download the app,” says Jenny Wanger, who runs programs on covid technology for Linux Foundation Public Health, a software development network.\nThis type of trust-building is especially important for marginalized communities, who have many legitimate reasons to distrust the government. While we don’t have any demographic data on exposure notification users, Sabeti points out that they may also be less willing to opt into the technology, which “greatly affects the uptake and overall effectiveness of these tools.” \nStill in a trial run\nEven after our analysis, it’s still hard to answer that crucial question: how many infections were actually prevented by exposure notifications?\nOur failure to answer that question is partially due to the fractured nature of the system. But it’s also because specific research to measure this technology’s effectiveness simply was not a priority.\nRafi Yahalom, a cybersecurity researcher at MIT, says that while the UK and Swiss analyses suggest that exposure notifications had a potentially significant impact on spread, he would like to see those studies replicated in the US and other communities with lower activation rates. \nAnd he says that if states had wanted to do so, they could have devised a simple evaluation: when someone comes in for a covid test, ask them if they received an exposure notification. Such a study may help determine whether those who get notified are actually more likely to be infected. After all, there are still a lot of questions regarding how the Bluetooth system should even be configured—it was originally based on CDC guidance stating that a 15-minute, under-6-feet interaction posed an infection risk, and we now know the true infection patterns are far more complicated.\nSo why didn’t any US public health agencies do a study like that? It’s about priorities. State departments did not have the time or resources to look at how well digital contact tracing works; instead, they were focused on doing anything and everything to stop the spread of the virus.\n“The ultimate goal [of exposure notifications] is for more folks to know they’ve been exposed,” says Hanna Sherrill, an Eagleton Science and Politics Fellow at Rutgers University who worked with the New Jersey public health agency on its exposure notifications system. “Hopefully some of them will take the advice to quarantine, and then they will stop the spread from there.

We have 26 different prototypes, tested in 26 different communities, and we’re still trying to understand the results. \n“In the US, the existing apps and tools have never hit the level of adoption necessary for them to be useful,” Sabeti says. But such success may not be out of reach for future public health crises. \nShe believes that future crises may require us to closely pair digital contact tracing with genomic sequencing and other surveillance methods.

Growing up in China, he was bullied by his Han Chinese classmates for being Uyghur. This made him constantly anxious, and his stomach often hurt, so much that sometimes he threw up. A concerned teacher referred him to counseling, but Aksu was skeptical it could help. “I was always waiting for the time when I could go out and live somewhere that I would feel comfortable,” Aksu says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, when news began to emerge of a government crackdown in China targeting Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups, Aksu was a graduate student in Central Asian Studies at Indiana University, Bloomington. In China’s northwestern Xinjiang province, where most Uyghurs live, people were going missing. Police targeted Uyghurs for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/campaign-02122018154124.html\">an ever-expanding list of infractions</a>: growing a beard, throwing a wedding party, having contact with people abroad, including members of their own family. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news grew worse every month. By the hundreds of thousands, the Communist Party forced Uyghurs into sprawling detention facilities, which it dubbed “vocational training centers” though they better resembled concentration camps. Inside, Uyghurs were subject to all manner of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/former-inmates-of-chinas-muslim-re-education-camps-tell-of-brainwashing-torture/2018/05/16/32b330e8-5850-11e8-8b92-45fdd7aaef3c_story.html?noredirect=on\">torture and abuse</a>; soon, the number of people interned topped 1 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aksu, in his early 30s, had lived abroad for years at this point—in Istanbul and Dubai, before the US—but always kept in close touch with family back home. A short phone call was 20 minutes. Long calls lasted hours. Now, like most Uyghurs living away from Xinjiang, Aksu was cut off from his parents and siblings entirely. He became depressed and later developed insomnia. All night, he wondered: was his family safe? Throughout 2018, Aksu learned his older brother, uncle, and two cousins had all died in Xinjiang. His anxiety deepened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, Aksu sought help from a local therapist. But the first meeting went terribly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like too many Americans, the therapist had never heard of “Uyghurs” or “Xinjiang.” Aksu spent most of the session detailing what was going on in China, rather than how it was affecting him. On his second, third, and fourth visits, little improved. “Instead of him listening to me with some compassion, I ended up talking about the Uyghurs, explaining who we are,” Aksu said. “It was very exhausting.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aksu tried a second therapist, who was better, but still he felt buried by having to explain his culture and the situation in Xinjiang in such depth. He became discouraged and eventually quit therapy.&nbsp;In 2019, he moved to Washington, DC, hoping for a fresh start. But of course, the sleepless nights followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aksu’s experiences are typical of many in the Uyghur diaspora, both those who left China long ago and who fled more recently to make a new life, away from persecution. Watching from afar as loved ones disappear and a way of life is erased, trauma has set in, sparking a mental health crisis that leaders in the diaspora say is all too apparent. Many, though, are reticent to seek help, or even acknowledge the emotional pain of the past years, leaving the community’s needs both underassessed and unmet. But lately a small group of outspoken Uyghurs is trying to change that. Using social media, they’re starting conversations about grief and mental health and, through telehealth, connecting people across the country with volunteer therapists.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The program, called the Uyghur Wellness Initiative, is still in its infancy; to date, it has paired only a few dozen Uyghurs with mental health professionals. As news from Xinjiang&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-amid-accusations-genocide-west-china-polices-could-cut-millions-uyghur-2021-06-07/\">grows worse</a>, however, its creators hope that it will help foster resilience in the diaspora—and provide a lifeline to a community during its darkest hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>“Uyghur 101”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rights abuses in Xinjiang have warped every aspect of Uyghur life. Thousands of mosques have been<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/25/world/asia/xinjiang-china-religious-site.html\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/25/world/asia/xinjiang-china-religious-site.html\">destroyed</a>. The Uyghur language is<a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/language-07282017143037.html\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/language-07282017143037.html\">banned in schools</a>. Many thousands have been pressed into<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html\">forced labor</a>. The camps likely represent the largest mass incarceration of an ethnic group since the Holocaust, and recently, the governments of the US, Canada, the Netherlands, and the UK formally labeled China’s actions “genocide.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Uyghur diaspora—which, in the US, is centered in DC and Northern Virginia—the past few years have been excruciating. Virtually everyone has family or close friends who have been sent to the camps. If they were to return to China, they too would surely be taken captive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, the psychological toll of the Xinjiang crisis was not deeply considered among the diaspora, says Rushan Abbas, director of the DC-based advocacy group Campaign For Uyghurs. For one thing, many felt that&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;weren’t the ones in danger and had little right to dwell on how the crisis was affecting&nbsp;<em>them</em>. Furthermore, Uyghur culture doesn’t emphasize mental health as such, Abbas says, and talking about it can carry significant social stigma.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18351619426034.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1026399\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18351619426034.jpg 3000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18351619426034.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18351619426034.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18351619426034.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18351619426034.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">AP PHOTO/JACQUELYN MARTIN</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the pain in the community, and the silence that had fallen over it, was apparent. “I hear a lot of people saying, ‘Oh, we used to have a normal life,’” Abbas says. “Now, when they do anything, even if they just laugh or have some sort of fun, they feel&nbsp;<em>guilty</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2019 and early 2020, Memet Emin, a Uyghur American medical researcher in New York, conducted a non-scientific survey of 1,100 members of the diaspora. Feelings of hopelessness, anger, and depression, he found, were common. Close to one in four respondents said they regularly experienced thoughts of suicide—roughly five times<a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml\">&nbsp;the adult average</a>&nbsp;in the US. And that was likely an undercount, Emin says.

This means many are reluctant to share information, even anonymously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, one crisis had begotten another. Coming together from a variety of advocacy groups, Uyghur leaders acknowledged they had a mental health emergency on their hands. They resolved to do something about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2020, representatives of three prominent Uyghur organizations in the US—the Uyghur Human Rights Project, the Uyghur American Association, and Abbas’s Campaign For Uyghurs, along with the religious nonprofit Peace Catalyst International—organized the first of several online training sessions called “Uyghur 101” for therapists. Over videoconferencing, they coached therapists on Uyghur history and culture. They detailed the ongoing rights abuses in Xinjiang and gave intimate testimony of their own challenges and grief.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then came their pitch to the Uyghur community. Because many in the diaspora fear the public eye, they offered a confidential referral system. They also tried to normalize therapy by describing their own suffering, says Abbas, whose sister was<a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/jailed-12302020182351.html\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/jailed-12302020182351.html\">sentenced to prison</a>&nbsp;in Xinjiang, likely in retaliation for Abbas’s advocacy. “I am frustrated and despairing,” Abbas says. “I wake up in middle of night, because I worry for my sister. It helps me to talk to somebody, to relieve some of these feelings.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone, finding the right therapist can be a fraught process. Between cost, location, specialty, and availability, the difficulty of the search can be a deterrent. Therapists working with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uyghurwellnessinitiative.com/\">Uyghur Wellness Initiative</a>, a collaboration between the Uyghur organizations, are doing so pro bono, lowering the first of those barriers. Through telehealth, leaders aimed to lower the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though many Uyghurs live in DC and Northern Virginia, others are dispersed across the country. The fact that telehealth is available almost anywhere means people outside of major metropolitan areas, where therapists specializing in trauma, immigration, and other relevant issues are easier to find, can also benefit. Likewise, therapists living in areas where there are few Uyghurs are now able to pitch in via the Wellness Initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most critically, the Wellness Initiative’s online cadre of therapists reduces the likelihood that a person seeking help will encounter a therapist who knows too little about China or Xinjiang; every therapist involved has already raised their hand to say they care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Progress has been slow, due partly to apprehension in the community towards talking about mental health. One by one, though, the crew is chipping away at walls and connecting people with support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>New connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The day in December 2019 that Aksu moved to DC, it rained. But straight away, he liked the city. He made friends. He got a job with the Uyghur Human Rights Project, a research and advocacy outfit, which he enjoyed. He felt happy—even after covid-19 upended everything. “I’d always wanted to move here and finally I had made it happen,” Aksu says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The burden of the atrocities in Xinjiang, however, was inescapable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Xinjiang police began sending Aksu text messages over WeChat and WhatsApp. They pressured him to cooperate and threatened his family. Aksu never responded, so messages arrived from more phone numbers, with diverse country codes, not just for mainland China but also Hong Kong and Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-solid-color\"><blockquote><p>Many felt that&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;weren’t the ones in danger and had little right to dwell on how the crisis was affecting&nbsp;<em>them</em>.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, Aksu received a call from an old friend, a high school classmate with whom he’d shared a dormitory bunkbed for four years. The friend, now a police officer, was polite. He reminisced about old memories and thanked Aksu for times he’d helped him. But it was clear the purpose of the call wasn’t friendly. “He wanted me to give him information,” Aksu says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it was, Aksu was struggling to hold things together. Though DC represented a positive change, he still ached for his family and remained “tortured” by his brother’s death. The phone call was a final straw. “I felt betrayed,” Aksu says. “I cried. I was saying, ‘How could this happen to me, how could someone do that?’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later that day, he passed out. He woke up the next morning on the floor to a colleague knocking on his door. Aksu had missed a meeting and coworkers were concerned. His anxiety, Aksu found, was back in force. So were the long, wakeful nights. Some days later, he passed out again. “Then, one day, I had this stupid idea of suicide.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was so concerned,” Aksu says. “Like, ‘Oh my god, why should I think about this?’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He confided in a colleague, who confided in their boss, Louisa Greve. Greve, the Uyghur Human Rights Project’s global advocacy director, took Aksu to a popular Uyghur restaurant in the district’s Cleveland Park neighborhood. Over spicy noodles, she comforted him and suggested he seek counseling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aksu had been here before, of course. He was reluctant to try therapy again, but allowed himself to be convinced. Greve introduced him to Charles Bates, a psychologist in Northern Virginia who had volunteered with the Uyghur Wellness Initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, the first meeting went great. Bates knew what was going on Xinjiang and, as a former refugee from Liberia, was versed in trauma and the immigrant experience. Twice a month, over Google Meet, Aksu and Bates began discussing strategies for “overcoming and minimizing trauma,” Aksu says. He was impressed by Bates’s attentiveness. “He takes notes, he never forgets what we talked about last time, and what’s our goal for the next session.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think he did his homework very well about the Uyghurs,” Aksu says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trusting in teletherapy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been treated as second-class citizens for decades, but because the current crisis there is relatively new, there are no formal studies articulating the unique shape of related trauma within the diaspora. According to Cathy Malchiodi, a psychologist and national trauma expert associated with the Uyghur Wellness Initiative, historical comparisons might serve as a guide to understanding what people are going through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the examples of Native Americans in the US and Jews during the Holocaust, Malchiodi suggests the terms “secondary trauma” and “intergenerational trauma and grief” as places to start. Each person will have their own reaction to a crisis, of course, but as a community Uyghurs likely share deep-seated senses of trauma and anguish, resulting both from historic oppression and ongoing efforts to expunge their culture. As Malchiodi explains, even people not directly affected by a crisis may still carry associated trauma with them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In some regards, Malchiodi says, talk therapy alone may be ill-suited to a challenge of this magnitude. “Most psychology and psychotherapy is very Western oriented,” Malchiodi says. “There needs to be an expanded view of what wellness means.” Investments and participation in cultural activities, for example, might prove as essential to the community’s mental health, she explains. Where talk therapy is effective is in addressing acute trauma symptoms, like anxiety and clinical depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the pandemic, roughly three-quarters of psychologists in the US<a href=\"https://www.apaservices.org/practice/legal/technology/psychologists-embrace-telehealth\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.apaservices.org/practice/legal/technology/psychologists-embrace-telehealth\">shifted to teletherapy</a>, usually via videoconferencing. There are drawbacks: State licensing requirements, for example, sometimes prohibit clinicians from working across state lines. Remote experiences deny therapists the nonverbal signals—how a person is sitting, bodily ticks like foot-tapping—that help them observe feelings a client isn’t verbalizing. But teletherapy can be just as effective as in-person sessions,<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/07/cover-telepsychology\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/07/cover-telepsychology\">according to the American Psychological Association</a>. And the relative comfort and safety a client might feel at home can be particularly conducive to a positive therapy experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This last point is especially relevant when it comes to the Uyghur community, says Bates, the therapist working with Aksu. The Communist Party has been extremely effective in setting Uyghurs around the world ill at ease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sometimes you can tell there are things they want to say, things that are implied,” Bates says. “But there’s a lot of fear. Fear of retribution for family members and even for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teletherapy allows clients to dip their feet in the water. “Trust needs to be built,” Bates says. “When you can trust, that’s when a lot of good things happen.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sharing the burden</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a slow start last year, this spring the Uyghur Wellness Initiative ramped up its efforts, including recently hiring a program coordinator. The few dozen that the group has helped so far is less than leaders might have hoped at first, but they say they’re only one piece of the puzzle in a broader cultural shift. In countries across Europe and in Australia, Uyghur groups are piloting similar projects; and these groups, along with ones in the US, have traded notes to support each other’s work. “It’s more of a movement, more of an emerging effort” across the diaspora, says Greve of the Uyghur Human Rights Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, project leaders are fine-tuning their message. With older audiences and first-generation immigrants, for example, indirect terms like “resilience” and “wellness,” which skirt around negative preconceptions of mental health, tend to resonate better than direct ones, like “depression” and “therapy.” With younger Uyghurs, the latter terms are often fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To spread the word, leaders hold regular informational sessions over videoconferencing platforms. They post on social media and host conversations on platforms like Facebook Live and the audio social network Clubhouse. In April, for Ramadan, they held a virtual celebration of Uyghur culture and cuisine. In May, a webinar featuring Aksu and two psychologists with the Wellness Initiative discussed the emotional burden of survivor’s guilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, too, a virtual approach has helped. Whereas many in the Uyghur community might hesitate to show their face in a public forum—whether for safety reasons or to avoid becoming the subject of gossip—the anonymity that some virtual environments proffer lowers the stakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how Dilare, a woman in her 30s living in Northern Virginia, arrived to a Clubhouse discussion this March. She’d seen an advertisement on Instagram—Uyghurs gathering to talk about mental health—and decided to pop in. But only to listen, she told herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>“When you can trust, that’s when a lot of good things happen.”</p><cite>Charles, Bates, a psychologist working with the uyghurs</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dilare is a rare case. Though she lives abroad, her contact with immediate family members in Xinjiang has not been altogether cut off. As far as she knows, no immediate family member has been taken to China’s camps. (Dilare is a pseudonym, chosen by her, to protect her privacy and her family’s safety.) Compared to what her Uyghur friends were going through, Dilare didn’t consider herself a victim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As conditions worsened in Xinjiang, though, her parents, when talking about close friends and extended family, repeatedly told Dilare they were “in the hospital.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I realized, ‘<em>Oh</em>, they’re not really in the hospital,” Dilare says. “They’re detained.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, one day, Dilare says it suddenly sank in that she may never be able to go home again. She became aware of the cloud of anxiety that had formed around her life. “You know, you feel low all the time, melancholy,” she says. “Even just looking at stuff, all of a sudden it’s not that bright and shiny anymore.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the March Clubhouse event, dozens like Dilare had joined in. Over the course of two and half hours, prominent community figures shared their experiences, which Dilare realized sounded an awful lot like hers. “When I heard that they were referring people to available therapists, that was just like, ‘Oh, let me do this.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Dilare talks with a therapist in Virginia once a week over FaceTime. At first, she was nervous that she would say the wrong thing. She was afraid she would come off as “too emotional.” “You just don’t want other people to see you as too damaged,” she says. But the therapy helped. Her therapist encouraged her to stop speaking in qualifiers and own her emotions. She’s started journaling, per the therapist’s recommendation, which Dilare says helps her recognize and manage her moods. She remains anxious before she begins each session—but once she starts talking that feeling quickly fades. “Now, it feels very natural and relaxing,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s Aksu’s experience, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Circumstances in Xinjiang remain grim. Aksu still worries that his activism is “ruining” his family’s life. “I feel totally lost sometimes,” he says. “I feel like, because of me they are suffering.” But at the end of therapy sessions, Aksu says, he feels a burst of energy. He feels able to carry on and notices himself smiling more. He has no intention of quitting therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I feel warm when I talk to him,” Aksu says of his time with his therapist. “I feel like there’s a connection, like I’m telling a story to someone I know.”</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Mustafa Aksu had a bad track record with therapists. Growing up in China, he was bullied by his Han Chinese classmates for being Uyghur. This made him constantly anxious, and his stomach often hurt, so much that sometimes he threw up. A concerned teacher referred him to counseling, but Aksu was skeptical it could help. “I was always waiting for the time when I could go out and live somewhere that I would feel comfortable,” Aksu says. \nIn 2017, when news began to emerge of a government crackdown in China targeting Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups, Aksu was a graduate student in Central Asian Studies at Indiana University, Bloomington. In China’s northwestern Xinjiang province, where most Uyghurs live, people were going missing. Police targeted Uyghurs for an ever-expanding list of infractions: growing a beard, throwing a wedding party, having contact with people abroad, including members of their own family. \nThe news grew worse every month. By the hundreds of thousands, the Communist Party forced Uyghurs into sprawling detention facilities, which it dubbed “vocational training centers” though they better resembled concentration camps. Inside, Uyghurs were subject to all manner of torture and abuse; soon, the number of people interned topped 1 million.\nAksu, in his early 30s, had lived abroad for years at this point—in Istanbul and Dubai, before the US—but always kept in close touch with family back home. A short phone call was 20 minutes. Long calls lasted hours. Now, like most Uyghurs living away from Xinjiang, Aksu was cut off from his parents and siblings entirely. He became depressed and later developed insomnia. All night, he wondered: was his family safe? Throughout 2018, Aksu learned his older brother, uncle, and two cousins had all died in Xinjiang. His anxiety deepened.\nEventually, Aksu sought help from a local therapist. But the first meeting went terribly.\nLike too many Americans, the therapist had never heard of “Uyghurs” or “Xinjiang.” Aksu spent most of the session detailing what was going on in China, rather than how it was affecting him. On his second, third, and fourth visits, little improved. “Instead of him listening to me with some compassion, I ended up talking about the Uyghurs, explaining who we are,” Aksu said. “It was very exhausting.”\nAksu tried a second therapist, who was better, but still he felt buried by having to explain his culture and the situation in Xinjiang in such depth. He became discouraged and eventually quit therapy. In 2019, he moved to Washington, DC, hoping for a fresh start. But of course, the sleepless nights followed.\nAksu’s experiences are typical of many in the Uyghur diaspora, both those who left China long ago and who fled more recently to make a new life, away from persecution. Watching from afar as loved ones disappear and a way of life is erased, trauma has set in, sparking a mental health crisis that leaders in the diaspora say is all too apparent. Many, though, are reticent to seek help, or even acknowledge the emotional pain of the past years, leaving the community’s needs both underassessed and unmet. But lately a small group of outspoken Uyghurs is trying to change that. Using social media, they’re starting conversations about grief and mental health and, through telehealth, connecting people across the country with volunteer therapists.\nThe program, called the Uyghur Wellness Initiative, is still in its infancy; to date, it has paired only a few dozen Uyghurs with mental health professionals. As news from Xinjiang grows worse, however, its creators hope that it will help foster resilience in the diaspora—and provide a lifeline to a community during its darkest hour.\n“Uyghur 101”\nRights abuses in Xinjiang have warped every aspect of Uyghur life. Thousands of mosques have been destroyed. The Uyghur language is banned in schools. Many thousands have been pressed into forced labor. The camps likely represent the largest mass incarceration of an ethnic group since the Holocaust, and recently, the governments of the US, Canada, the Netherlands, and the UK formally labeled China’s actions “genocide.”\nFor the Uyghur diaspora—which, in the US, is centered in DC and Northern Virginia—the past few years have been excruciating. Virtually everyone has family or close friends who have been sent to the camps. If they were to return to China, they too would surely be taken captive.\nAt first, the psychological toll of the Xinjiang crisis was not deeply considered among the diaspora, says Rushan Abbas, director of the DC-based advocacy group Campaign For Uyghurs. For one thing, many felt that they weren’t the ones in danger and had little right to dwell on how the crisis was affecting them. Furthermore, Uyghur culture doesn’t emphasize mental health as such, Abbas says, and talking about it can carry significant social stigma.\n\nAP PHOTO/JACQUELYN MARTIN\nStill, the pain in the community, and the silence that had fallen over it, was apparent. “I hear a lot of people saying, ‘Oh, we used to have a normal life,’” Abbas says. “Now, when they do anything, even if they just laugh or have some sort of fun, they feel guilty.”\nBetween 2019 and early 2020, Memet Emin, a Uyghur American medical researcher in New York, conducted a non-scientific survey of 1,100 members of the diaspora. Feelings of hopelessness, anger, and depression, he found, were common. Close to one in four respondents said they regularly experienced thoughts of suicide—roughly five times the adult average in the US. And that was likely an undercount, Emin says. Communist Party authorities routinely harassUyghurs outside of China, warning them on social media against speaking out, demanding personal information about themselves or others in the diaspora, and threatening retaliation against friends and family in Xinjiang if they don’t comply. This means many are reluctant to share information, even anonymously.\nClearly, one crisis had begotten another. Coming together from a variety of advocacy groups, Uyghur leaders acknowledged they had a mental health emergency on their hands. They resolved to do something about it.\nIn May 2020, representatives of three prominent Uyghur organizations in the US—the Uyghur Human Rights Project, the Uyghur American Association, and Abbas’s Campaign For Uyghurs, along with the religious nonprofit Peace Catalyst International—organized the first of several online training sessions called “Uyghur 101” for therapists. Over videoconferencing, they coached therapists on Uyghur history and culture. They detailed the ongoing rights abuses in Xinjiang and gave intimate testimony of their own challenges and grief.\nThen came their pitch to the Uyghur community. Because many in the diaspora fear the public eye, they offered a confidential referral system. They also tried to normalize therapy by describing their own suffering, says Abbas, whose sister was sentenced to prison in Xinjiang, likely in retaliation for Abbas’s advocacy. “I am frustrated and despairing,” Abbas says. “I wake up in middle of night, because I worry for my sister. It helps me to talk to somebody, to relieve some of these feelings.”\nFor anyone, finding the right therapist can be a fraught process.

He has no intention of quitting therapy.\n“I feel warm when I talk to him,” Aksu says of his time with his therapist. “I feel like there’s a connection, like I’m telling a story to someone I know.”","dc:creator":"Andrew McCormick","content":"Mustafa Aksu had a bad track record with therapists.

They should be designed to also record interactions, create insights, capture analytics, and deliver a more personalized experience each time students engage with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us have grown to rely on virtual assistants, such as Alexa or Google Home, to save us time and make our lives easier. Expanding their use to help facilitate ongoing learning makes a lot sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Predictive analytics. </strong>Predictive analytics is a powerful tool to help anticipate a student’s success in a course by drawing on the interplay between machine learning, AI, and other technologies to help adult learners persist. It allows higher education institutions to identify a learner who is struggling to complete assignments and perhaps at risk of dropping out of a program so that advisors, professors, and other support systems can intervene early with one-on-one support for the student. For employers partnering with higher education providers, this is a powerful tool to ensure their employees are on track to complete a program they have invested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These relatively simple nudges are important. Life can, and often does, get in the way of education for working adults, who may be juggling a family or other priorities at home, so reminders and offers of support go a long way in helping a student achieve their education goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gamification techniques.</strong> Gamification places game mechanics—such as point systems and tracking, achievement levels, awards and prizes—into non-game situations. It is already part of our everyday lives, across many industries, like fitness class leaderboards and airline frequent flier programs. Studies have shown that gaming strategy motivates consistent participation and long-term engagement among users. For example, a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6a63/27c77d2a8851dbbdf156842e1612d1ebc1c3.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6a63/27c77d2a8851dbbdf156842e1612d1ebc1c3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">study from Finland</a> found that a simple gamification strategy of awarding badges to students in a post-secondary computer science course had a positive impact—a majority of students said that trying to achieve badges increased their motivation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher education must embrace and invest in gamification technology to help promote good student behaviors and boost learning success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online learning can make student engagement challenging. Even before the pandemic hit and all coursework moved online, online instruction was scrutinized for its inability to keep students engaged and on track. Add these challenges on top of additional responsibilities for adult learners, such as work and caring for children, and engagement becomes even more challenging. Gamification is one way to help motivate adult learners and instill a sense of accountability and engagement, and it serves as a great foray into online learning for students new to this type of instruction, helping them get more comfortable with completing assignments online and nudging them to complete necessary tasks such as reading a syllabus or signing into the message boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Using technology to manage your training and benefits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your employer offers tuition assistance or reimbursement programs as a perk, it likely has some sort of education management platform to manage the back-end operations like disbursal of benefits and program verification. But these platforms can oftentimes be clunky, with employers maneuvering between multiple interfaces for information regarding an employee’s education progress and spending, and employees figuring out which programs are covered under their tuition assistance benefits.

The busy, working adult is not the same as the 18-year-old who has just graduated high school and is ready to spend four years on campus.

economists, and government leaders have regularly sounded alarms about the dangers of big tech monopolies. On her 2020 campaign website, for example, Senator Elizabeth Warren said “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://2020.elizabethwarren.com/toolkit/break-up-big-tech\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://2020.elizabethwarren.com/toolkit/break-up-big-tech\" target=\"_blank\">big tech companies</a> have too much power, too much power over our economy, our society, our democracy.” In the months since the election, politicians on both the left and right have expressed concerns over how to encourage competition and innovation among the big tech leaders, and even how to hold onto democratic ideals in the face of digital misinformation and conspiracy theories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with a company like Facebook is that its business model actively encourages tribalism and anger, which is not the way markets usually work, says Paul Romer, an economics professor at New York University who previously served as the chief economist of The World Bank and was the co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics Sciences. “When economists defend the market, we have this very simple idea in mind, where I as a buyer give something and get some good back,” he says. “None of those features are characteristic of this new market for digital services, where advertising is like the hidden method of capturing compensation for these firms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users, he says, “are being manipulated in ways that they don&#8217;t fully understand.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regulators won’t work because big tech firms are too powerful, Romer maintains, while traditional antitrust laws are not well-suited to deal with this problem. But a progressive tax on digital advertising revenue, passed by state legislatures, could create a unique incentive for companies such as Google and Facebook to split up their businesses and discourage growth by acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a progressive tax model, however, needs to be aggressive: “The kind of tax that I think would create a big incentive to change at, say, Google and Facebook, the two biggest firms in this market, has to be a tax where the average tax rate they pay right now, given their size, is 35% of their revenue.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Show notes and links:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adtax.paulromer.net/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://adtax.paulromer.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Taxing Digital Advertising</a>,” Paul Romer, May 1, 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/maryland-breaks-ground-digital-advertising-tax\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/maryland-breaks-ground-digital-advertising-tax\" target=\"_blank\">Maryland Breaks Ground with Digital Advertising Tax</a>,” National Law Review, March 17, 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/technology/tech-antitrust-paul-romer.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/technology/tech-antitrust-paul-romer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Once Tech’s Favorite Economist, Now a Thorn in Its Side</a>,” Steve Lohr, New York Times, May 20, 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Full transcript:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel Ruma</em><strong><em>: </em></strong>I’m Laurel Ruma from MIT Technology Review and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is taxing digital advertising. Can taxes specifically aimed at breaking up big tech be levied to encourage competition, innovation, and help democracy? The five largest tech companies, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet/Google and Microsoft are worth a combined $7 trillion. What economic efficiencies can be gained in the fight for fairness? Two words for you: Rethinking capitalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guest is Paul Romer, an economics professor at New York University who served as the chief economist of The World Bank. Paul was the co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics Sciences, for his work in integrating technological innovations into long-run macro economic analysis. For the first time, this integrated ideas and innovation into economic models and clarified the societal benefits that are possible when people come together to collaborate in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Omidyar Network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to The Business Lab, Paul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul Romer</em><strong><em>:</em></strong> It&#8217;s good to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: United States Senator Elizabeth Warren said, and I quote, &#8220;Big tech companies have too much power, too much power over our economy, our society, our democracy.&#8221; What is the danger of monopolies, of these large powerful companies?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul:</em> That&#8217;s a well-crafted sentence by Senator Warren because it ends on the most important point. The real danger here is the threat to our democracy. The second most important one is the threat to the social fabric that determines our quality of life. One of the problems with economics and the way it has approached antitrust is that it has neglected those two issues and focused on very narrow questions: Are firms charging too much for some service? And does that mean that some people aren&#8217;t using as much of it as they could? But that captures only a small fraction of the damage that&#8217;s being done by having firms that are so large, and firms that are using a particular business model, this model based on targeted digital advertising, which has created so many bad incentives, and which creates such unusual risks for our democratic system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>What are some of those risks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul:</em> The nature of the advertising model is that these firms want to keep people engaged watching the screen, so that they see more ads. Facebook discovered, and their research has been published on this, that if they could create more contention, more animosity, more anger, people would stay engaged for a longer period of time. And so we&#8217;ve got a business model which is actively encouraging some of the most damaging sides of human nature, this tribalism, this anger, this tendency to treat your opponent as an enemy who&#8217;s almost inhuman. So this is not the way markets usually work. When economists defend the market, we have this very simple idea in mind, where I as a buyer give something, I give money to a seller. I get some good back. And then if I don&#8217;t like what I get back, I can take my business elsewhere. None of those features are characteristic of this new market for digital services, where advertising is like the hidden method of capturing compensation for these firms. And users are being manipulated in ways that they don&#8217;t fully understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel:</em> So what kind of regulatory actions could have or should have been taken to confront the growth of some of these enormous companies?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>To be honest, push back if you don&#8217;t like this answer, but I tend to like to look forward. We could look at decisions that we made in the past that were a mistake. But I think the really important ones are: What should we do now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>To go ahead and challenge that, is it something that needs to be looked at perhaps more frequently? I mean, do we have to wait until something really bad happens, until an election is almost overthrown?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>Well, I will say I think we&#8217;ve been negligent. Economists and people who shape opinion, people who worry about policy, I think we&#8217;re guilty of gross negligence in letting this problem fester and become so bad. So I think it&#8217;s very clear to me that we need to do something to stop the trajectory that we&#8217;re on. And I think it&#8217;s a huge mistake on all of our parts that we didn&#8217;t act sooner. But the real question is: What do we do now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>There&#8217;s two issues here, right? One is the way that these enormous companies make the money, and then the enormity of these enormous companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>Well, of those two, I think this business model, based on targeted digital advertising, has created these enormous incentives for spying on people and collecting information. A few years ago, I started saying that these firms know more about me than the Stasi knew about people in East Germany. And that was kind of like a controversial thing to say back then. Now everybody just accepts that. They think this is just the inevitable consequence of the market and technology. But they&#8217;ve lost the outrage, and they&#8217;ve lost the sense of how dangerous it is to let any small group of people have that much information that they can use to manipulate us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>We&#8217;ve fallen into this trap of thinking, &#8220;Well, we use these services for free, so giving them a little bit of my data, I&#8217;m okay with.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not really what we&#8217;re talking about anymore, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul:</em> I think this one is a tricky one because by and large, the cost from, say, each person letting these companies have all this information is not something that each individual bears. It&#8217;s really a cost to society, so letting them have information from all of us means that they have enormous monopoly power. They can collect enormous returns and accumulate this enormous amount of wealth that you described. But it also gives them the ability to, for example, display targeted political ads, where one demographic group is being shown a message from one candidate that the rest of us never see. And those ads, just like the strategy for engagement, those ads often appeal to animosity, tribalism, anger. Again, we&#8217;re using advertising to enhance, to develop the worst side of human nature. And you don&#8217;t have to look very far in history to see how bad things can turn out when you amplify and normalize this very ugly, angry side of our instincts about us versus them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>A slight shift: It seems as soon as we as a society identify something as too big to fail, it fails, causing unknown and often catastrophic outcomes. I&#8217;m thinking of Boeing as an example. So what do you think about Boeing and how large it&#8217;s become and what that actually means?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>After the 2008 financial crisis, I wrote a paper saying that the FFA, combined with the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, those two agencies were the gold standard for regulation. We should be trying to have a similar kind of structure for regulating financial markets. Well, fast forward a decade and a half, what&#8217;s happened is that Boeing, as this concentrated interest, was able to work through the Congress and cite the messages from economists about how regulation slows down innovation. And Boeing managed to eviscerate what used to be this very effective regulatory system at the FAA with some oversight by the NTSB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then Boeing, as a result, because there was no regulatory oversight, built this really kludge of an airplane that turned out to be incredibly dangerous and killed people. So it&#8217;s a story of the erosion of regulatory capacity that was achieved through pretty straightforward means, for example, just cutting the budget or limiting the budget at the FAA, so they couldn&#8217;t hire enough people to do the job they were assigned to do, to regulate Boeing.&nbsp; So this was a case where, by undercutting the regulation, Boeing hurt its workers, hurt its shareholders, killed people. It was a really terrible turn of events, but I think it&#8217;s a caution for us because people who say, well, like Facebook, are saying, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s just have some regulators that regulate the tech firms.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the Boeing episode tells us is that a firm that&#8217;s strong enough can actually corrupt and eviscerate any regulatory system, and can often capture those regulators. So I&#8217;m very pessimistic that any regulatory body can actually rein in and control these firms. And of course, I think that&#8217;s why Facebook is advocating for regulation because they know that&#8217;s the measure that would leave them in the strongest position. So when I started thinking, well, what can we do about these firms? I started from the very beginning and said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a system with checks and balances, with a kind of executive branch, where regulators sit. You&#8217;ve got the judiciary that hears antitrust cases. And you&#8217;ve got the legislature.&#8221; Which of these three systems is the one to use to try and deal with the problems that we&#8217;re facing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I concluded that I think regulators would just not work because the firms we&#8217;re dealing with are already way too powerful. And I also, this is a separate point that we could explore, but I also think that the judiciary and antitrust, traditional antitrust laws, are not well suited to dealing with this problem. So the way forward, it seemed to me, was for us as voters to say to our legislators, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to live in a society like this, where a few individuals have so much power, and where they&#8217;re using that power to kind of undermine the quality of social life and threaten our democracy.&#8221; So if we said that to our legislators, we&#8217;d tell the legislators, &#8220;Pass a law that stops this bad behavior.&#8221; And then the tax that I proposed was a measure that legislatures could pass that could do a lot to solve the problems that we&#8217;re facing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel:</em> Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about that. You mentioned a progressive tax on advertising. How would that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul:</em> When you impose a tax, you have to anticipate that people will do things to avoid paying tax. So I designed a tax where the things they would do to try and avoid paying tax are exactly the things we want them to do. So we want this tax to be progressive. The bigger the total advertising revenue the firm collects, the higher the tax rate. So if one of these firms splits itself in two, like if Facebook were to spin Instagram out, the total tax bill for the two firms would be smaller when they&#8217;re separate compared to when it&#8217;s part of one combined entity. So the progressivity in the tax encourages split ups, spin outs. It discourages growth by acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing is that I suggested it be a tax imposed on revenue from digital advertising. So if these firms don&#8217;t want to pay this tax, they could shift to a subscription model, the kind of model that Netflix uses, or a service like Duolingo uses, so that people actually pay something to get access to some valuable service. So you can do this, but this tax has to be big enough to create a real stick that if you don&#8217;t do something to change, you&#8217;re going to pay a lot of tax to the government if you stick with this very damaging model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel:</em> I was absolutely captivated by this model and the fact that it&#8217;s real in the US state of Maryland. The state legislature is considering legislation, Senate Bill Two, to create an advertising tax on tech companies, and it works like this, a tax somewhere between 2.5% and 10% would be applied to digital ad sales in the state of Maryland on IP addresses. And that would be a huge amount of money raised, something like $250 million annually. So you were part of that effort to really push this through the legislature. What did you say in your testimony to support this idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>Just to kind of just recap where we are, they&#8217;ve actually passed this bill. The governor vetoed it at the end of last year, but the legislature overrode the veto, so this bill is now law in Maryland. It is going to be challenged by these tech companies, usually operating through some front organizations that they&#8217;ll use to challenge it in court. So we have some ways to go in this fight, the fight&#8217;s not over. But the message I gave to the legislators, I mean first, I wrote an op-ed in the <em>New York Times</em>, which is what somebody there read and then reached out to me about pursuing this idea. They were interested in this partly because they had made a commitment to significantly improve their educational system and they were looking for sources of revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they also understood the problems with big tech, and understood the appeal of going after a tax which actually is targeting harmful behavior. To set expectations, I think there&#8217;s a chance that the current bill will be overturned in court. There&#8217;s going to be a lot of legal resources that are deployed to try and fight this. And one of the things I told the legislators in private is just expect that the first bill might be overturned. Watch and see what this really somewhat politicized federal judiciary is going to say is wrong with the bill, and be ready to pass a new version that avoids the problems that they complain about. So this is a longer term battle plan we have to have, and we shouldn&#8217;t be worried about setbacks along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other point I made to them was that most taxes discourage good things. If you imposed a tax on going to school, fewer people would go to school. That&#8217;d be a bad tax. But this is a tax which discourages a bad thing, and that&#8217;s the most important kind of tax to pursue when you need revenue, and it&#8217;s a way to discourage bad things. I liken it to my co-recipient for the prize, Bill Nordhaus&#8217; idea of a tax on carbon emissions, which has the same motivation, which is to stop people from doing something which is very harmful for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing is that the tax rates that they thought were politically feasible in Maryland are frankly too low to make much difference for these tech firms. Even if every state in the United States, or the federal government adopted a tax at the rates that they&#8217;re looking at, progressive from 0%, to 2%, to 10%, this would be kind of small change for these tech companies. So I have a new proposal that I&#8217;m about to launch for the national government, where we impose taxes that get much higher and which I think really are strong enough to change behavior in these tech firms. And one other thing we might want to talk about is why it&#8217;s so important to tax revenue rather than corporate income because the corporate income tax is a deeply flawed and failing way to try and tax corporations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel:</em> That seems to be an issue in the United States that&#8217;s coming up more and more, as companies look for creative ways to avoid paying on those corporate revenue numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>It&#8217;s really a losing battle because conceptually, income is the difference between revenue and cost. Revenue and cost are incurred in different places, so you can&#8217;t say, &#8220;Where is income earned?&#8221; That creates at this level of principle, I mean, forget about how hard it is to get the information you need to impose this tax. Even if you had all the information you wanted, reasonable people can differ about where income is earned because it&#8217;s a difference in two things. That creates all this opportunity for firms to shift the legal location for income and to move income to these low tax jurisdictions, so you get this race to the bottom, different jurisdictions are competing by offering lower and lower corporate tax rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people think you can patch this and try and limit this behavior. I think you&#8217;re just fighting a losing battle, and we really need to switch to something like taxing revenue because we know where revenue is collected. We know that there are ads that these firms get paid to serve up, that are shown to people in Maryland, or in Massachusetts, or California. And so this empowers each of those states to tax revenue that is incurred in those states. And they don&#8217;t face this issue of a race to the bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>We’re increasing taxes, but we&#8217;re doing it for a good reason because education needs more money. We&#8217;re also doing it because these large companies aren&#8217;t paying their fair share. 10% may sound like a large number, but not when you&#8217;re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. But this is a start. Right? So the Omidyar Network is looking at how you actually implement various policy ideas to rebalance this inequity in the data economy. This is one solution. Can you think of others? Are you looking at others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul:</em> It&#8217;s important to emphasize that this will not address all of the issues we face associated with firms that are so large and so powerful. Apple, for example, does not capture much revenue through advertising, and it&#8217;s got a very strong market position that people may want to think about other measures that might limit its power. I frankly am not as worried about Apple because Apple isn&#8217;t destroying our democracy and undermining the quality of life. But there are traditional reasons why you might not want firms that are so powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon, for example, is now collecting a growing share of its revenue through advertising, but it also had very strong positions in just being the platform for matching buyers and sellers. So it would still be a very powerful force, even if it just abandoned digital advertising revenue. So in both of these cases, there&#8217;s room to think about other measures that could deal with the traditional problems of firms that are too large. In terms of the specific measures that one could employ, the one part of antitrust law that&#8217;s been significantly underutilized and should be brought back is merger review. It should be much harder for one of these dominant firms to acquire a new firm that could potentially grow into a competitor, such as the Facebook purchase of Instagram or WhatsApp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a properly functioning system, those mergers and acquisitions should not have been allowed, so that&#8217;s an easy thing to do. The part of antitrust which I think is just doomed is trying to bring a lawsuit and charge them with committing a crime, and then get a judge to agree to break them up based on their “crime” that they&#8217;ve committed. This is a very crude way to try and limit size, and it puts judges in a position which is really untenable for them. It is a very complicated type of penalty to impose, and so their tendency has been even in cases where there&#8217;s a clearly demonstrated violation of the antitrust law, like there was with Microsoft, judges overturned. In the appeals courts, they overturned the breakup remedy that the Justice Department had proposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to be clear, I worked with the Justice Department in crafting this remedy. The appeals courts refused to implement something that they felt was so aggressive and so intrusive. And I think that&#8217;s the problem we&#8217;ll face with any lawsuit that tries to now force Facebook to spin out Instagram. So the only way I see to get those two things separate now is to create a very strong incentive, so that they&#8217;ll save $10 billion a year in taxes if they split it into two companies instead of running it as one company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>So perhaps we should get down into these details about a progressive tax on advertising. If that is one possible lever, how does that progressive tax work? And would it necessarily be federal, or could it be state by state, by municipality?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>I think that it could be either. And this is why it&#8217;s so important to pick revenue because different jurisdictions could make their own decisions on this. This has implications internationally as well. The US could decide how much it wants to tax ad revenue, but Canada could make its own decision on that. Germany and France could make their own decisions. So we want to empower all of these different jurisdictions to make their own decisions in response to the wishes of their citizens and voters. So we want to get away from a system where you have to have these international tax treaties where everybody&#8217;s agreeing to do the same thing to have the tax system work, and that&#8217;s really where we are with the corporate income tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in terms of the level of taxation, I want to be clear about this. The kind of tax that I think would create a big incentive to change at, say, Google and Facebook, the two biggest firms in this market, I think this has to be a tax where the average tax rate they pay right now, given their size, is on the order of 35%. So 35% of their revenue would be collected by the government if they don&#8217;t change, if they just stick with business as usual. And to get to an average tax rate, if your tax rate is kind of gradually increasing as you come up, you start with a big bracket where there&#8217;s no tax at all, and then it&#8217;s a 5% tax, 10% tax. To get an average tax rate of 35%, you need to have marginal tax rates, like the tax on the highest bracket of revenue. You need marginal tax rates that are 50%, 60%, even approaching 70%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this needs to be a very aggressive tax. People will scream like stuck pigs when I go public, as I guess I&#8217;m doing right now about what these tax rates need to be. But there&#8217;s a couple of easy ways to respond to this. I mean, one is, these companies will say, &#8220;If you took 30% or 40% of our revenue, you would kill us.&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s actually not true&#8211;30% or 40% of their revenue would just move them back to what they were earning in 2019, 2020. They&#8217;ve experienced enormous growth. Everybody thought they were viable in 2018, 2019, 2020, so it can&#8217;t be true that you take away 30% of their revenue, suddenly revenue that was great three years ago is now impossible to live on in this new model. And of course, this is because their costs are mainly fixed costs. They can just scale up how many of these ads they serve up without incurring a lot more cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they could certainly be viable if they had to pay 30%, 40% of their revenue to the government. And this would actually attract and collect a reasonable amount of revenue that could be used, say, to finance the infrastructure bill, for example. $50 billion, $60 billion and growing per year in tax revenue. The other thing about a tax that is aggressive is that it does mean that a firm that might pay $15 billion, at the scale of Google and Facebook, might pay $12 billion, $15 billion in tax a year. If they split themselves in half, that&#8217;ll go down dramatically, maybe from $12 billion to $6 billion, or $15 billion to $6 billion. And if they split themselves into four pieces, their tax bill would go down, the total tax bill across all of the surviving firms, the total tax bill could be as low as $2 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the reason to be so aggressive about this is that if these companies scream as they will, the answer is just, listen, guys, if you don&#8217;t want to pay the tax, just switch to a subscription model. Just don&#8217;t use the ads. Or if you don&#8217;t want to pay the tax, just split yourself up into independent companies. So I think we have to be ready to tolerate and remain firm in the face of these screams of outrage about high marginal tax rates and just insist that, listen, we are the citizens in this country. And in a democracy, we get to decide what kind of society we&#8217;re going to live in. And we don&#8217;t want to live in a society that lets you continue to do what you&#8217;re doing right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>And that is certainly unique characteristics of the data economy. So we now have these issues of: How do we reduce disinformation? How do we increase privacy? Rebalancing the wealth and reducing the economic dependency on these large farms, to think that you could break up one of them into four different companies and still have each one be worth $2 billion at least is quite something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>Worth probably, I don&#8217;t know, $25 billion or more. But they&#8217;d collectively still be paying $2 billion a year, say, in tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>I&#8217;m sorry. You&#8217;re correct. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul: </em>There&#8217;s a movie I like, <em>Chinatown</em>, with Jack Nicholson, where at the very end of the movie something terrible happens to an innocent woman who&#8217;s killed. And Nicholson is devastated. And some friend says to him, &#8220;Forget it, Jake. It&#8217;s Chinatown.&#8221; The message is, you can&#8217;t do anything. This is so complicated. The forces you&#8217;re fighting are so powerful. You can&#8217;t do anything about this. Well, this is kind of the message economists have been sending for decades now. It&#8217;s the market, forget it. It&#8217;s the market. You can&#8217;t control what the market does. If you&#8217;ve got these firms that are now dominating political advertising, forget about it. Forget it. You can&#8217;t do anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s just so false. As citizens, we can decide we don&#8217;t want them to have that kind of power in our markets for political advertising. We don&#8217;t want all of these secret targeted ads that are inflaming the passions. And so the economists need to stop encouraging this learned helplessness amongst the citizenry, and we need to be saying, &#8220;It is up to us to decide what kind of a society we want to live in.&#8221; And if we make a decision, we get our legislators to make a change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by the way, I think that despite the polarization we&#8217;re seeing right now, this issue might be one where you could attract some attention from both the left and the right because the right has been keenly aware of the enormous power, say, that Mark Zuckerberg possesses, or Jack Dorsey possesses at Twitter. And so they are now kind of shifting away from their usual defense of, well, it&#8217;s the market, so it must be good, and recognizing, no, there&#8217;s some aspects of this market equilibrium that we think are really bad, that are kind of inconsistent with the principles of freedom and free speech that this country was founded on. So I&#8217;m mildly optimistic that this is something where we could reach some kind of a consensus and actually do something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>Speaking of representation, on which America is founded, there have been rumblings in Congress holding these firms accountable. Are you hopeful that might actually happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paul:</em> Well, I think those rumblings have been somewhat useful in raising attention. But they&#8217;re mostly, so far at least, theater. There&#8217;s really no consensus around an agenda for what we could do. There are people like Senator Warren, Senator Warner, who&#8217;ve been thinking about measures we could adopt. But there&#8217;s been no coalescing around some practical measure. So we need to get out, get moved beyond these showpieces, where we express outrage and try to watch these executives squirm. We need to get to the point where we actually do something that will make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel: </em>And what a great call to action that is.

On her 2020 campaign website, for example, Senator Elizabeth Warren said “big tech companies have too much power, too much power over our economy, our society, our democracy.” In the months since the election, politicians on both the left and right have expressed concerns over how to encourage competition and innovation among the big tech leaders, and even how to hold onto democratic ideals in the face of digital misinformation and conspiracy theories.\nThe challenge with a company like Facebook is that its business model actively encourages tribalism and anger, which is not the way markets usually work, says Paul Romer, an economics professor at New York University who previously served as the chief economist of The World Bank and was the co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics Sciences. “When economists defend the market, we have this very simple idea in mind, where I as a buyer give something and get some good back,” he says. “None of those features are characteristic of this new market for digital services, where advertising is like the hidden method of capturing compensation for these firms.”\nUsers, he says, “are being manipulated in ways that they don’t fully understand.”\nRegulators won’t work because big tech firms are too powerful, Romer maintains, while traditional antitrust laws are not well-suited to deal with this problem. But a progressive tax on digital advertising revenue, passed by state legislatures, could create a unique incentive for companies such as Google and Facebook to split up their businesses and discourage growth by acquisition.\nSuch a progressive tax model, however, needs to be aggressive: “The kind of tax that I think would create a big incentive to change at, say, Google and Facebook, the two biggest firms in this market, has to be a tax where the average tax rate they pay right now, given their size, is 35% of their revenue.”\nShow notes and links:\n“Taxing Digital Advertising,” Paul Romer, May 1, 2021\n“Maryland Breaks Ground with Digital Advertising Tax,” National Law Review, March 17, 2021\n“Once Tech’s Favorite Economist, Now a Thorn in Its Side,” Steve Lohr, New York Times, May 20, 2021\nFull transcript:\nLaurel Ruma: I’m Laurel Ruma from MIT Technology Review and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is taxing digital advertising. Can taxes specifically aimed at breaking up big tech be levied to encourage competition, innovation, and help democracy? The five largest tech companies, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet/Google and Microsoft are worth a combined $7 trillion. What economic efficiencies can be gained in the fight for fairness? Two words for you: Rethinking capitalism.\nMy guest is Paul Romer, an economics professor at New York University who served as the chief economist of The World Bank. Paul was the co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics Sciences, for his work in integrating technological innovations into long-run macro economic analysis. For the first time, this integrated ideas and innovation into economic models and clarified the societal benefits that are possible when people come together to collaborate in new ways.\nThis episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Omidyar Network.\nWelcome to The Business Lab, Paul.\nPaul Romer: It’s good to be here.\nLaurel: United States Senator Elizabeth Warren said, and I quote, “Big tech companies have too much power, too much power over our economy, our society, our democracy.” What is the danger of monopolies, of these large powerful companies?\nPaul: That’s a well-crafted sentence by Senator Warren because it ends on the most important point. The real danger here is the threat to our democracy. The second most important one is the threat to the social fabric that determines our quality of life. One of the problems with economics and the way it has approached antitrust is that it has neglected those two issues and focused on very narrow questions: Are firms charging too much for some service? And does that mean that some people aren’t using as much of it as they could? But that captures only a small fraction of the damage that’s being done by having firms that are so large, and firms that are using a particular business model, this model based on targeted digital advertising, which has created so many bad incentives, and which creates such unusual risks for our democratic system.\nLaurel: What are some of those risks?\nPaul: The nature of the advertising model is that these firms want to keep people engaged watching the screen, so that they see more ads. Facebook discovered, and their research has been published on this, that if they could create more contention, more animosity, more anger, people would stay engaged for a longer period of time. And so we’ve got a business model which is actively encouraging some of the most damaging sides of human nature, this tribalism, this anger, this tendency to treat your opponent as an enemy who’s almost inhuman. So this is not the way markets usually work. When economists defend the market, we have this very simple idea in mind, where I as a buyer give something, I give money to a seller. I get some good back. And then if I don’t like what I get back, I can take my business elsewhere. None of those features are characteristic of this new market for digital services, where advertising is like the hidden method of capturing compensation for these firms. And users are being manipulated in ways that they don’t fully understand.\nLaurel: So what kind of regulatory actions could have or should have been taken to confront the growth of some of these enormous companies?\nPaul: To be honest, push back if you don’t like this answer, but I tend to like to look forward. We could look at decisions that we made in the past that were a mistake. But I think the really important ones are: What should we do now?\nLaurel: To go ahead and challenge that, is it something that needs to be looked at perhaps more frequently? I mean, do we have to wait until something really bad happens, until an election is almost overthrown?\nPaul: Well, I will say I think we’ve been negligent. Economists and people who shape opinion, people who worry about policy, I think we’re guilty of gross negligence in letting this problem fester and become so bad. So I think it’s very clear to me that we need to do something to stop the trajectory that we’re on. And I think it’s a huge mistake on all of our parts that we didn’t act sooner. But the real question is: What do we do now?\nLaurel: There’s two issues here, right? One is the way that these enormous companies make the money, and then the enormity of these enormous companies.\nPaul: Well, of those two, I think this business model, based on targeted digital advertising, has created these enormous incentives for spying on people and collecting information. A few years ago, I started saying that these firms know more about me than the Stasi knew about people in East Germany. And that was kind of like a controversial thing to say back then. Now everybody just accepts that. They think this is just the inevitable consequence of the market and technology. But they’ve lost the outrage, and they’ve lost the sense of how dangerous it is to let any small group of people have that much information that they can use to manipulate us.\nLaurel: We’ve fallen into this trap of thinking, “Well, we use these services for free, so giving them a little bit of my data, I’m okay with.” But that’s not really what we’re talking about anymore, is it?\nPaul: I think this one is a tricky one because by and large, the cost from, say, each person letting these companies have all this information is not something that each individual bears. It’s really a cost to society, so letting them have information from all of us means that they have enormous monopoly power. They can collect enormous returns and accumulate this enormous amount of wealth that you described. But it also gives them the ability to, for example, display targeted political ads, where one demographic group is being shown a message from one candidate that the rest of us never see. And those ads, just like the strategy for engagement, those ads often appeal to animosity, tribalism, anger. Again, we’re using advertising to enhance, to develop the worst side of human nature. And you don’t have to look very far in history to see how bad things can turn out when you amplify and normalize this very ugly, angry side of our instincts about us versus them.\nLaurel: A slight shift: It seems as soon as we as a society identify something as too big to fail, it fails, causing unknown and often catastrophic outcomes. I’m thinking of Boeing as an example. So what do you think about Boeing and how large it’s become and what that actually means?\nPaul: After the 2008 financial crisis, I wrote a paper saying that the FFA, combined with the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, those two agencies were the gold standard for regulation. We should be trying to have a similar kind of structure for regulating financial markets. Well, fast forward a decade and a half, what’s happened is that Boeing, as this concentrated interest, was able to work through the Congress and cite the messages from economists about how regulation slows down innovation. And Boeing managed to eviscerate what used to be this very effective regulatory system at the FAA with some oversight by the NTSB.\nAnd then Boeing, as a result, because there was no regulatory oversight, built this really kludge of an airplane that turned out to be incredibly dangerous and killed people. So it’s a story of the erosion of regulatory capacity that was achieved through pretty straightforward means, for example, just cutting the budget or limiting the budget at the FAA, so they couldn’t hire enough people to do the job they were assigned to do, to regulate Boeing.  So this was a case where, by undercutting the regulation, Boeing hurt its workers, hurt its shareholders, killed people. It was a really terrible turn of events, but I think it’s a caution for us because people who say, well, like Facebook, are saying, “Well, let’s just have some regulators that regulate the tech firms.”\nWhat the Boeing episode tells us is that a firm that’s strong enough can actually corrupt and eviscerate any regulatory system, and can often capture those regulators. So I’m very pessimistic that any regulatory body can actually rein in and control these firms. And of course, I think that’s why Facebook is advocating for regulation because they know that’s the measure that would leave them in the strongest position. So when I started thinking, well, what can we do about these firms? I started from the very beginning and said, “We’ve got a system with checks and balances, with a kind of executive branch, where regulators sit. You’ve got the judiciary that hears antitrust cases. And you’ve got the legislature.” Which of these three systems is the one to use to try and deal with the problems that we’re facing?\nI concluded that I think regulators would just not work because the firms we’re dealing with are already way too powerful. And I also, this is a separate point that we could explore, but I also think that the judiciary and antitrust, traditional antitrust laws, are not well suited to dealing with this problem. So the way forward, it seemed to me, was for us as voters to say to our legislators, “We don’t want to live in a society like this, where a few individuals have so much power, and where they’re using that power to kind of undermine the quality of social life and threaten our democracy.” So if we said that to our legislators, we’d tell the legislators, “Pass a law that stops this bad behavior.” And then the tax that I proposed was a measure that legislatures could pass that could do a lot to solve the problems that we’re facing.\nLaurel: Let’s talk a little bit about that. You mentioned a progressive tax on advertising. How would that work?\nPaul: When you impose a tax, you have to anticipate that people will do things to avoid paying tax. So I designed a tax where the things they would do to try and avoid paying tax are exactly the things we want them to do. So we want this tax to be progressive. The bigger the total advertising revenue the firm collects, the higher the tax rate. So if one of these firms splits itself in two, like if Facebook were to spin Instagram out, the total tax bill for the two firms would be smaller when they’re separate compared to when it’s part of one combined entity. So the progressivity in the tax encourages split ups, spin outs. It discourages growth by acquisition.\nThe other thing is that I suggested it be a tax imposed on revenue from digital advertising. So if these firms don’t want to pay this tax, they could shift to a subscription model, the kind of model that Netflix uses, or a service like Duolingo uses, so that people actually pay something to get access to some valuable service. So you can do this, but this tax has to be big enough to create a real stick that if you don’t do something to change, you’re going to pay a lot of tax to the government if you stick with this very damaging model.\nLaurel: I was absolutely captivated by this model and the fact that it’s real in the US state of Maryland. The state legislature is considering legislation, Senate Bill Two, to create an advertising tax on tech companies, and it works like this, a tax somewhere between 2.5% and 10% would be applied to digital ad sales in the state of Maryland on IP addresses. And that would be a huge amount of money raised, something like $250 million annually. So you were part of that effort to really push this through the legislature. What did you say in your testimony to support this idea?\nPaul: Just to kind of just recap where we are, they’ve actually passed this bill. The governor vetoed it at the end of last year, but the legislature overrode the veto, so this bill is now law in Maryland. It is going to be challenged by these tech companies, usually operating through some front organizations that they’ll use to challenge it in court. So we have some ways to go in this fight, the fight’s not over. But the message I gave to the legislators, I mean first, I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, which is what somebody there read and then reached out to me about pursuing this idea. They were interested in this partly because they had made a commitment to significantly improve their educational system and they were looking for sources of revenue.\nBut they also understood the problems with big tech, and understood the appeal of going after a tax which actually is targeting harmful behavior. To set expectations, I think there’s a chance that the current bill will be overturned in court. There’s going to be a lot of legal resources that are deployed to try and fight this. And one of the things I told the legislators in private is just expect that the first bill might be overturned. Watch and see what this really somewhat politicized federal judiciary is going to say is wrong with the bill, and be ready to pass a new version that avoids the problems that they complain about. So this is a longer term battle plan we have to have, and we shouldn’t be worried about setbacks along the way.\nThe other point I made to them was that most taxes discourage good things. If you imposed a tax on going to school, fewer people would go to school. That’d be a bad tax. But this is a tax which discourages a bad thing, and that’s the most important kind of tax to pursue when you need revenue, and it’s a way to discourage bad things. I liken it to my co-recipient for the prize, Bill Nordhaus’ idea of a tax on carbon emissions, which has the same motivation, which is to stop people from doing something which is very harmful for all of us.\nThe other thing is that the tax rates that they thought were politically feasible in Maryland are frankly too low to make much difference for these tech firms. Even if every state in the United States, or the federal government adopted a tax at the rates that they’re looking at, progressive from 0%, to 2%, to 10%, this would be kind of small change for these tech companies. So I have a new proposal that I’m about to launch for the national government, where we impose taxes that get much higher and which I think really are strong enough to change behavior in these tech firms. And one other thing we might want to talk about is why it’s so important to tax revenue rather than corporate income because the corporate income tax is a deeply flawed and failing way to try and tax corporations.\nLaurel: That seems to be an issue in the United States that’s coming up more and more, as companies look for creative ways to avoid paying on those corporate revenue numbers.\nPaul: It’s really a losing battle because conceptually, income is the difference between revenue and cost. Revenue and cost are incurred in different places, so you can’t say, “Where is income earned?” That creates at this level of principle, I mean, forget about how hard it is to get the information you need to impose this tax. Even if you had all the information you wanted, reasonable people can differ about where income is earned because it’s a difference in two things. That creates all this opportunity for firms to shift the legal location for income and to move income to these low tax jurisdictions, so you get this race to the bottom, different jurisdictions are competing by offering lower and lower corporate tax rates.\nSome people think you can patch this and try and limit this behavior. I think you’re just fighting a losing battle, and we really need to switch to something like taxing revenue because we know where revenue is collected. We know that there are ads that these firms get paid to serve up, that are shown to people in Maryland, or in Massachusetts, or California. And so this empowers each of those states to tax revenue that is incurred in those states. And they don’t face this issue of a race to the bottom.\nLaurel: We’re increasing taxes, but we’re doing it for a good reason because education needs more money. We’re also doing it because these large companies aren’t paying their fair share. 10% may sound like a large number, but not when you’re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. But this is a start. Right? So the Omidyar Network is looking at how you actually implement various policy ideas to rebalance this inequity in the data economy. This is one solution. Can you think of others? Are you looking at others?\nPaul: It’s important to emphasize that this will not address all of the issues we face associated with firms that are so large and so powerful. Apple, for example, does not capture much revenue through advertising, and it’s got a very strong market position that people may want to think about other measures that might limit its power. I frankly am not as worried about Apple because Apple isn’t destroying our democracy and undermining the quality of life. But there are traditional reasons why you might not want firms that are so powerful.\nAmazon, for example, is now collecting a growing share of its revenue through advertising, but it also had very strong positions in just being the platform for matching buyers and sellers. So it would still be a very powerful force, even if it just abandoned digital advertising revenue. So in both of these cases, there’s room to think about other measures that could deal with the traditional problems of firms that are too large. In terms of the specific measures that one could employ, the one part of antitrust law that’s been significantly underutilized and should be brought back is merger review. It should be much harder for one of these dominant firms to acquire a new firm that could potentially grow into a competitor, such as the Facebook purchase of Instagram or WhatsApp.\nIn a properly functioning system, those mergers and acquisitions should not have been allowed, so that’s an easy thing to do. The part of antitrust which I think is just doomed is trying to bring a lawsuit and charge them with committing a crime, and then get a judge to agree to break them up based on their “crime” that they’ve committed. This is a very crude way to try and limit size, and it puts judges in a position which is really untenable for them. It is a very complicated type of penalty to impose, and so their tendency has been even in cases where there’s a clearly demonstrated violation of the antitrust law, like there was with Microsoft, judges overturned. In the appeals courts, they overturned the breakup remedy that the Justice Department had proposed.\nAnd to be clear, I worked with the Justice Department in crafting this remedy. The appeals courts refused to implement something that they felt was so aggressive and so intrusive. And I think that’s the problem we’ll face with any lawsuit that tries to now force Facebook to spin out Instagram. So the only way I see to get those two things separate now is to create a very strong incentive, so that they’ll save $10 billion a year in taxes if they split it into two companies instead of running it as one company.\nLaurel: So perhaps we should get down into these details about a progressive tax on advertising. If that is one possible lever, how does that progressive tax work? And would it necessarily be federal, or could it be state by state, by municipality?\nPaul: I think that it could be either. And this is why it’s so important to pick revenue because different jurisdictions could make their own decisions on this. This has implications internationally as well. The US could decide how much it wants to tax ad revenue, but Canada could make its own decision on that. Germany and France could make their own decisions. So we want to empower all of these different jurisdictions to make their own decisions in response to the wishes of their citizens and voters. So we want to get away from a system where you have to have these international tax treaties where everybody’s agreeing to do the same thing to have the tax system work, and that’s really where we are with the corporate income tax.\nBut in terms of the level of taxation, I want to be clear about this. The kind of tax that I think would create a big incentive to change at, say, Google and Facebook, the two biggest firms in this market, I think this has to be a tax where the average tax rate they pay right now, given their size, is on the order of 35%. So 35% of their revenue would be collected by the government if they don’t change, if they just stick with business as usual. And to get to an average tax rate, if your tax rate is kind of gradually increasing as you come up, you start with a big bracket where there’s no tax at all, and then it’s a 5% tax, 10% tax. To get an average tax rate of 35%, you need to have marginal tax rates, like the tax on the highest bracket of revenue. You need marginal tax rates that are 50%, 60%, even approaching 70%.\nSo this needs to be a very aggressive tax. People will scream like stuck pigs when I go public, as I guess I’m doing right now about what these tax rates need to be. But there’s a couple of easy ways to respond to this. I mean, one is, these companies will say, “If you took 30% or 40% of our revenue, you would kill us.” Well, that’s actually not true–30% or 40% of their revenue would just move them back to what they were earning in 2019, 2020. They’ve experienced enormous growth. Everybody thought they were viable in 2018, 2019, 2020, so it can’t be true that you take away 30% of their revenue, suddenly revenue that was great three years ago is now impossible to live on in this new model. And of course, this is because their costs are mainly fixed costs. They can just scale up how many of these ads they serve up without incurring a lot more cost.\nSo they could certainly be viable if they had to pay 30%, 40% of their revenue to the government. And this would actually attract and collect a reasonable amount of revenue that could be used, say, to finance the infrastructure bill, for example. $50 billion, $60 billion and growing per year in tax revenue. The other thing about a tax that is aggressive is that it does mean that a firm that might pay $15 billion, at the scale of Google and Facebook, might pay $12 billion, $15 billion in tax a year. If they split themselves in half, that’ll go down dramatically, maybe from $12 billion to $6 billion, or $15 billion to $6 billion. And if they split themselves into four pieces, their tax bill would go down, the total tax bill across all of the surviving firms, the total tax bill could be as low as $2 billion.\nAnd the reason to be so aggressive about this is that if these companies scream as they will, the answer is just, listen, guys, if you don’t want to pay the tax, just switch to a subscription model. Just don’t use the ads. Or if you don’t want to pay the tax, just split yourself up into independent companies. So I think we have to be ready to tolerate and remain firm in the face of these screams of outrage about high marginal tax rates and just insist that, listen, we are the citizens in this country. And in a democracy, we get to decide what kind of society we’re going to live in. And we don’t want to live in a society that lets you continue to do what you’re doing right now.\nLaurel: And that is certainly unique characteristics of the data economy. So we now have these issues of: How do we reduce disinformation? How do we increase privacy? Rebalancing the wealth and reducing the economic dependency on these large farms, to think that you could break up one of them into four different companies and still have each one be worth $2 billion at least is quite something else.\nPaul: Worth probably, I don’t know, $25 billion or more. But they’d collectively still be paying $2 billion a year, say, in tax.\nLaurel: I’m sorry. You’re correct. Thank you.\nPaul: There’s a movie I like, Chinatown, with Jack Nicholson, where at the very end of the movie something terrible happens to an innocent woman who’s killed. And Nicholson is devastated. And some friend says to him, “Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.” The message is, you can’t do anything. This is so complicated. The forces you’re fighting are so powerful. You can’t do anything about this. Well, this is kind of the message economists have been sending for decades now. It’s the market, forget it. It’s the market. You can’t control what the market does. If you’ve got these firms that are now dominating political advertising, forget about it. Forget it. You can’t do anything.\nThat’s just so false. As citizens, we can decide we don’t want them to have that kind of power in our markets for political advertising. We don’t want all of these secret targeted ads that are inflaming the passions. And so the economists need to stop encouraging this learned helplessness amongst the citizenry, and we need to be saying, “It is up to us to decide what kind of a society we want to live in.” And if we make a decision, we get our legislators to make a change.\nAnd by the way, I think that despite the polarization we’re seeing right now, this issue might be one where you could attract some attention from both the left and the right because the right has been keenly aware of the enormous power, say, that Mark Zuckerberg possesses, or Jack Dorsey possesses at Twitter. And so they are now kind of shifting away from their usual defense of, well, it’s the market, so it must be good, and recognizing, no, there’s some aspects of this market equilibrium that we think are really bad, that are kind of inconsistent with the principles of freedom and free speech that this country was founded on. So I’m mildly optimistic that this is something where we could reach some kind of a consensus and actually do something.\nLaurel: Speaking of representation, on which America is founded, there have been rumblings in Congress holding these firms accountable. Are you hopeful that might actually happen?\nPaul: Well, I think those rumblings have been somewhat useful in raising attention. But they’re mostly, so far at least, theater. There’s really no consensus around an agenda for what we could do. There are people like Senator Warren, Senator Warner, who’ve been thinking about measures we could adopt. But there’s been no coalescing around some practical measure. So we need to get out, get moved beyond these showpieces, where we express outrage and try to watch these executives squirm. We need to get to the point where we actually do something that will make a difference.\nLaurel: And what a great call to action that is. Thank you, Paul, for joining us today on The Business Lab.\nPaul: Thank you.

Gebru wanted to identify the risks posed by <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/20/1025135/ai-large-language-models-bigscience-project/\">large language models</a>, one of the most stunning recent breakthroughs in AI research. The models are algorithms trained on staggering amounts of text. Under the right conditions, they can compose what look like convincing passages of prose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a few years, tech companies had been racing to build bigger versions and integrate them into consumer products. Google, which invented the technique, was already using one to improve the relevance of search results. OpenAI announced the largest one, called <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017797/gpt3-best-worst-ai-openai-natural-language/\">GPT-3</a>, in June 2020 and licensed it exclusively to Microsoft a few months later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gebru worried about how fast the technology was being deployed. In the paper she wound up writing with Bender and five others, she detailed the possible dangers. The models were enormously costly to create—both environmentally (they require huge amounts of computational power) and financially; they were often trained on the toxic and abusive language of the internet; and they’d come to dominate research in language AI, elbowing out promising alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other existing AI techniques, the models don’t actually understand language. But because they can manipulate it to retrieve text-based information for users or generate natural conversation, they can be packaged into products and services that make tech companies lots of money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That November, Gebru submitted the paper to a conference. Soon after, Google executives asked her to retract it, and when she refused, they fired her. Two months later, they also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56135817\">fired her coauthor Margaret Mitchell</a>, the other leader of the ethical AI team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dismantling of that team sparked one of the largest controversies within the AI world in recent memory. Defenders of Google argued that the company has the right to supervise its own researchers. But for many others, it solidified fears about the degree of control that tech giants now have over the field. Big Tech is now the primary employer and funder of AI researchers, including, somewhat ironically, many of those who assess its social impacts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Among the world’s richest and most powerful companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple have made AI core parts of their business. Advances over the last decade, particularly in an AI technique called <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/03/1011616/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton-deep-learning-will-do-everything/\">deep learning</a>, have allowed them to monitor users’ behavior; recommend news, information, and products to them; and most of all, target them with ads. Last year Google’s advertising apparatus generated over $140 billion in revenue. Facebook’s generated $84 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies have invested heavily in the technology that has brought them such vast wealth. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, acquired the London-based AI lab <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/\">DeepMind</a> for $600 million in 2014 and spends hundreds of millions a year to support its research. Microsoft signed a $1 billion deal with OpenAI in 2019 for commercialization rights to its algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, tech giants have become large investors in university-based AI research, heavily influencing its scientific priorities. Over the years, more and more ambitious scientists have transitioned to working for tech giants full time or adopted a dual affiliation. From 2018 to 2019, 58% of the most cited papers at the top two AI conferences had at least one author affiliated with a tech giant, compared with only 11% a decade earlier, according to a study by researchers in the <a href=\"https://radicalai.net/\">Radical AI Network</a>, a group that seeks to challenge power dynamics in AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that the corporate agenda for AI has focused on techniques with commercial potential, largely ignoring research that could help address challenges like economic inequality and climate change. In fact, it has made these challenges worse. The drive to automate tasks has cost jobs and led to the rise of tedious labor like data cleaning and content moderation. The push to create ever larger models has caused AI’s energy consumption to explode. Deep learning has also created a culture in which our data is constantly scraped, often without consent, to train products like facial recognition systems. And recommendation algorithms have exacerbated political polarization, while large language models have failed to clean up misinformation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s this situation that Gebru and a growing movement of like-minded scholars want to change. Over the last five years, they’ve sought to shift the field’s priorities away from simply enriching tech companies, by expanding who gets to participate in developing the technology. Their goal is not only to mitigate the harms caused by existing systems but to create a new, more equitable and democratic AI.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>“Hello from Timnit”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2015, Gebru sat down to pen an open letter. Halfway through her PhD at Stanford, she’d attended the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, the largest annual AI research gathering. Of the more than 3,700 researchers there, Gebru counted only five who were Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a small meeting about a niche academic subject, NeurIPS (as it’s now known) was quickly becoming the biggest annual AI job bonanza. The world’s wealthiest companies were coming to show off demos, throw extravagant parties, and write hefty checks for the rarest people in Silicon Valley: skillful AI researchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That year Elon Musk arrived to announce the nonprofit venture <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/\">OpenAI</a>. He, Y Combinator’s then president Sam Altman, and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel had put up $1 billion to solve what they believed to be an existential problem: the prospect that a superintelligence could one day take over the world. Their solution: build an even better superintelligence. Of the 14 advisors or technical team members he anointed, 11 were white men.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1515\" height=\"1572\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/timnit.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1026163\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/timnit.jpg 1515w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/timnit.jpg?resize=289,300 289w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/timnit.jpg?resize=768,797 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/timnit.jpg?resize=1480,1536 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1515px) 100vw, 1515px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">RICARDO SANTOS | COURTESY PHOTO</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Musk was being lionized, Gebru was dealing with humiliation and harassment. At a conference party, a group of drunk guys in Google Research T-shirts circled her and subjected her to unwanted hugs, a kiss on the cheek, and a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gebru typed out a scathing critique of what she had observed: the spectacle, the cult-like worship of AI celebrities, and most of all, the overwhelming homogeneity. This boy’s club culture, she wrote, had already pushed talented women out of the field. It was also leading the entire community toward a dangerously narrow conception of artificial intelligence and its impact on the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google had already deployed a computer-vision algorithm that classified Black people as gorillas, she noted. And the increasing sophistication of unmanned drones was putting the US military on a path toward lethal autonomous weapons. But there was no mention of these issues in Musk’s grand plan to stop AI from taking over the world in some theoretical future scenario. “We don’t have to project into the future to see AI’s potential adverse effects,” Gebru wrote. “It is already happening.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gebru never published her reflection. But she realized that something needed to change. On January 28, 2016, she sent an email with the subject line “Hello from Timnit” to five other Black AI researchers. “I’ve always been sad by the lack of color in AI,” she wrote. “But now I have seen 5 of you <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> and thought that it would be cool if we started a black in AI group or at least know of each other.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The email prompted a discussion. What was it about being Black that informed their research? For Gebru, her work was very much a product of her identity; for others, it was not. But after meeting they agreed: If AI was going to play a bigger role in society, they needed more Black researchers. Otherwise, the field would produce weaker science—and its adverse consequences could get far worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A profit-driven agenda</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://blackinai.github.io/#/\">Black in AI</a> was just beginning to coalesce, AI was hitting its commercial stride. That year, 2016, tech giants spent an estimated $20 to $30 billion on developing the technology, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heated by corporate investment, the field warped. Thousands more researchers began studying AI, but they mostly wanted to work on deep-learning algorithms, such as the ones behind large language models. “As a young PhD student who wants to get a job at a tech company, you realize that tech companies are all about deep learning,” says Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer science professor who now serves at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “So you shift all your research to deep learning. Then the next PhD student coming in looks around and says, ‘Everyone’s doing deep learning. I should probably do it too.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But deep learning isn’t the only technique in the field. Before its boom, there was a different AI approach known as symbolic reasoning. Whereas deep learning uses massive amounts of data to teach algorithms about meaningful relationships in information, symbolic reasoning focuses on explicitly encoding knowledge and logic based on human expertise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some researchers now believe those techniques should be combined. The hybrid approach would make AI more efficient in its use of data and energy, and give it the knowledge and reasoning abilities of an expert as well as the capacity to update itself with new information. But companies have little incentive to explore alternative approaches when the surest way to maximize their profits is to build ever bigger models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In their paper, Gebru and Bender alluded to a basic cost of this tendency to stick with deep learning: the more advanced AI systems we need are not being developed, and similar problems keep recurring. Facebook, for example, relies heavily on large language models for automated content moderation. But without really understanding the meaning behind text, those models often fail. They regularly take down innocuous posts while giving hate speech and misinformation a pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-based facial recognition systems suffer from the same issue. They’re trained on massive amounts of data but see only pixel patterns—they do not have a grasp of visual concepts like eyes, mouths, and noses. That can trip these systems up when they’re used on individuals with a different skin tone from the people they were shown during training. Nonetheless, Amazon and other companies have sold these systems to law enforcement. In the US, they have caused three known cases of police jailing the wrong person—all Black men—in the last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, many in the AI community largely acquiesced to Big Tech’s role in shaping the development and impact of these technologies. While some expressed discomfort with the corporate takeover, many more welcomed the industry’s deep well of funding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the shortcomings of today’s AI have become more evident—both its failure to solve social problems and the mounting examples that it can exacerbate them—faith in Big Tech has weakened. Google’s ousting of Gebru and Mitchell further stoked the discussion by revealing just how much companies will prioritize profit over self-policing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the immediate aftermath, over 2,600 Google employees and 4,300 others signed a petition denouncing Gebru’s dismissal as “unprecedented research censorship.” Half a year later, research groups are still rejecting the company’s funding, researchers refuse to participate in its conference workshops, and employees are leaving in protest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike five years ago, when Gebru began raising these questions, there’s now a well-established movement questioning what AI should be and who it should serve. This isn’t a coincidence. It’s very much a product of Gebru’s own initiative, which began with the simple act of inviting more Black researchers into the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>It takes a conference</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2017, the new Black in AI group hosted its first workshop at NeurIPS. While organizing the workshop, Gebru approached Joy Buolamwini, an MIT Media Lab researcher who was studying commercial facial recognition systems for possible bias. Buolamwini had begun testing these systems after one failed to detect her own face unless she donned a white mask. She submitted her preliminary results to the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deborah Raji, then an undergraduate researcher, was another early participant. Raji was appalled by the culture she’d observed at NeurIPS. The workshop became her respite. “To go from four or five days of that to a full day of people that look like me talking about succeeding in this space—it was such important encouragement for me,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buolamwini, Raji, and Gebru would go on to work together on a pair of groundbreaking studies about discriminatory computer-vision systems. Buolamwini and Gebru coauthored <a href=\"http://gendershades.org/\">Gender Shades</a>, which showed that the facial recognition systems sold by Microsoft, IBM, and Chinese tech giant Megvii had remarkably high failure rates on Black women despite near-perfect performance on white men. Raji and Buolamwini then collaborated on a follow-up called <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/123456\">Actionable Auditing</a>, which found the same to be true for Amazon’s Rekognition. In 2020, Amazon would agree to a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/12/1003482/amazon-stopped-selling-police-face-recognition-fight/\">one-year moratorium on police sales</a> of its product, in part because of that work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the very first Black in AI workshop, though, these successes were distant possibilities. There was no agenda other than to build community and produce research based on their sorely lacking perspectives. Many onlookers didn’t understand why such a group needed to exist. Gebru remembers dismissive comments from some in the AI community. But for others, Black in AI pointed a new way forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was true for William Agnew and Raphael Gontijo Lopes, both queer men conducting research in computer science, who realized they could form a Queer in AI group. (Other groups that took shape include Latinx in AI, {Dis}Ability in AI, and Muslim in ML.) For Agnew, in particular, having such a community felt like an urgent need. “It was hard to even imagine myself having a happy life,” he says, reflecting on the lack of queer role models in the field. “There’s Turing, but he committed suicide. So that’s depressing. And the queer part of him is just ignored.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all affinity group members see a connection between their identity and their research. Still, each group has established particular expertise. Black in AI has become the intellectual center for exposing algorithmic discrimination, critiquing surveillance, and developing data-efficient AI techniques. Queer in AI has become a center for contesting the ways algorithms infringe on people’s privacy and classify them into bounded categories by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venkatasubramanian and Gebru also helped create the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) conference to create a forum for research on the social and political implications of AI. Ideas and draft papers discussed at NeurIPS affinity group workshops often become the basis for papers published at FAccT, which then showcases that research to broader audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was after Buolamwini presented at the first Black in AI workshop, for example, that FAccT published Gender Shades. Along with Actionable Auditing, it then fueled several major education and advocacy campaigns to limit government use of facial recognition. When Amazon attempted to undermine the legitimacy of Buolamwini’s and Raji’s research, dozens of AI researchers and civil society organizations banded together to defend them, foreshadowing what they would later do for Gebru. Those efforts eventually contributed to Amazon’s moratorium, which in May the company announced it would extend indefinitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research also set off a cascade of regulation. More than a dozen cities have banned police use of facial recognition, and Massachusetts now requires police to get a judge’s permission to use it. Both the US and the European Commission have proposed additional regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“First we had to just be there,” says Gebru. “And at some point, what Black in AI says starts to become important. And what all of these groups together say becomes important. You have to listen to us now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Follow the money</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After Gebru and Mitchell’s firing, the field is grappling anew with an age-old question: Is it possible to change the status quo while working from within? Gebru still believes working with tech giants is the best way to identify the problems. But she also believes that corporate researchers need stronger legal protections. If they see risky practices, they should be able to publicly share their observations without jeopardizing their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the question of funding. Many researchers want more investment from the US government to support work that is critical of commercial AI development and advances the public welfare. Last year, it committed a measly $1 billion to non-defense-related AI research. The Biden administration is now asking Congress to invest an additional $180 billion in emerging technologies, with AI as a top priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such funding could help people like <a href=\"https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/rabebe.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rediet Abebe</a>, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Abebe came into AI with ideas of using it to advance social equity. But when she started her PhD at Cornell, no one was focused on doing such research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fall of 2016, as a PhD student, she began a small Cornell reading group with a fellow graduate student to study topics like housing instability, health-care access, and inequality. She then embarked on a new project to see whether her computational skills could support efforts to alleviate poverty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, she found the Poverty Tracker study, a detailed data set on the financial shocks—unexpected expenses like medical bills or parking tickets—experienced by more than 2,000 New York families. Over many conversations with the study’s authors, social workers, and nonprofits serving marginalized communities, she learned about their needs and told them how she could help. Abebe then developed a model that showed how the frequency and type of shocks affected a family’s economic status.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years later, the project is still ongoing. She’s now collaborating with nonprofits to improve her model and working with policymakers through the California Policy Lab to use it as a tool for preventing homelessness. Her reading group has also since grown into a 2,000-person community and is holding its inaugural conference later this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abebe sees it as a way to incentivize more researchers to flip the norms of AI. While traditional computer science conferences emphasize advancing computational techniques for the sake of doing so, the new one will publish work that first seeks to deeply understand a social issue. The work is no less technical, but it builds the foundation for more socially meaningful AI to emerge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These changes that we’re fighting for—it’s not just for marginalized groups,” she says. “It’s actually for everyone.” </p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Timnit Gebru never thought a scientific paper would cause her so much trouble. \nIn 2020, as the co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, Gebru had reached out to Emily Bender, a linguistics professor at the University of Washington, and asked to collaborate on research about the troubling direction of artificial intelligence.

Over the last five years, they’ve sought to shift the field’s priorities away from simply enriching tech companies, by expanding who gets to participate in developing the technology. Their goal is not only to mitigate the harms caused by existing systems but to create a new, more equitable and democratic AI. \n“Hello from Timnit”\nIn December 2015, Gebru sat down to pen an open letter. Halfway through her PhD at Stanford, she’d attended the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, the largest annual AI research gathering. Of the more than 3,700 researchers there, Gebru counted only five who were Black.\nOnce a small meeting about a niche academic subject, NeurIPS (as it’s now known) was quickly becoming the biggest annual AI job bonanza. The world’s wealthiest companies were coming to show off demos, throw extravagant parties, and write hefty checks for the rarest people in Silicon Valley: skillful AI researchers.\nThat year Elon Musk arrived to announce the nonprofit venture OpenAI. He, Y Combinator’s then president Sam Altman, and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel had put up $1 billion to solve what they believed to be an existential problem: the prospect that a superintelligence could one day take over the world. Their solution: build an even better superintelligence. Of the 14 advisors or technical team members he anointed, 11 were white men.\n\nRICARDO SANTOS | COURTESY PHOTO\nWhile Musk was being lionized, Gebru was dealing with humiliation and harassment. At a conference party, a group of drunk guys in Google Research T-shirts circled her and subjected her to unwanted hugs, a kiss on the cheek, and a photo.\nGebru typed out a scathing critique of what she had observed: the spectacle, the cult-like worship of AI celebrities, and most of all, the overwhelming homogeneity. This boy’s club culture, she wrote, had already pushed talented women out of the field. It was also leading the entire community toward a dangerously narrow conception of artificial intelligence and its impact on the world.\nGoogle had already deployed a computer-vision algorithm that classified Black people as gorillas, she noted. And the increasing sophistication of unmanned drones was putting the US military on a path toward lethal autonomous weapons. But there was no mention of these issues in Musk’s grand plan to stop AI from taking over the world in some theoretical future scenario. “We don’t have to project into the future to see AI’s potential adverse effects,” Gebru wrote. “It is already happening.”\nGebru never published her reflection. But she realized that something needed to change. On January 28, 2016, she sent an email with the subject line “Hello from Timnit” to five other Black AI researchers. “I’ve always been sad by the lack of color in AI,” she wrote. “But now I have seen 5 of you  and thought that it would be cool if we started a black in AI group or at least know of each other.”\nThe email prompted a discussion. What was it about being Black that informed their research? For Gebru, her work was very much a product of her identity; for others, it was not. But after meeting they agreed: If AI was going to play a bigger role in society, they needed more Black researchers. Otherwise, the field would produce weaker science—and its adverse consequences could get far worse.\nA profit-driven agenda\nAs Black in AI was just beginning to coalesce, AI was hitting its commercial stride. That year, 2016, tech giants spent an estimated $20 to $30 billion on developing the technology, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.\nHeated by corporate investment, the field warped. Thousands more researchers began studying AI, but they mostly wanted to work on deep-learning algorithms, such as the ones behind large language models. “As a young PhD student who wants to get a job at a tech company, you realize that tech companies are all about deep learning,” says Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer science professor who now serves at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “So you shift all your research to deep learning. Then the next PhD student coming in looks around and says, ‘Everyone’s doing deep learning. I should probably do it too.’”\nBut deep learning isn’t the only technique in the field. Before its boom, there was a different AI approach known as symbolic reasoning. Whereas deep learning uses massive amounts of data to teach algorithms about meaningful relationships in information, symbolic reasoning focuses on explicitly encoding knowledge and logic based on human expertise. \nSome researchers now believe those techniques should be combined. The hybrid approach would make AI more efficient in its use of data and energy, and give it the knowledge and reasoning abilities of an expert as well as the capacity to update itself with new information. But companies have little incentive to explore alternative approaches when the surest way to maximize their profits is to build ever bigger models. \nIn their paper, Gebru and Bender alluded to a basic cost of this tendency to stick with deep learning: the more advanced AI systems we need are not being developed, and similar problems keep recurring. Facebook, for example, relies heavily on large language models for automated content moderation. But without really understanding the meaning behind text, those models often fail. They regularly take down innocuous posts while giving hate speech and misinformation a pass.\nAI-based facial recognition systems suffer from the same issue. They’re trained on massive amounts of data but see only pixel patterns—they do not have a grasp of visual concepts like eyes, mouths, and noses. That can trip these systems up when they’re used on individuals with a different skin tone from the people they were shown during training. Nonetheless, Amazon and other companies have sold these systems to law enforcement. In the US, they have caused three known cases of police jailing the wrong person—all Black men—in the last year.\nFor years, many in the AI community largely acquiesced to Big Tech’s role in shaping the development and impact of these technologies. While some expressed discomfort with the corporate takeover, many more welcomed the industry’s deep well of funding. \nBut as the shortcomings of today’s AI have become more evident—both its failure to solve social problems and the mounting examples that it can exacerbate them—faith in Big Tech has weakened. Google’s ousting of Gebru and Mitchell further stoked the discussion by revealing just how much companies will prioritize profit over self-policing.\nIn the immediate aftermath, over 2,600 Google employees and 4,300 others signed a petition denouncing Gebru’s dismissal as “unprecedented research censorship.” Half a year later, research groups are still rejecting the company’s funding, researchers refuse to participate in its conference workshops, and employees are leaving in protest.\nUnlike five years ago, when Gebru began raising these questions, there’s now a well-established movement questioning what AI should be and who it should serve. This isn’t a coincidence. It’s very much a product of Gebru’s own initiative, which began with the simple act of inviting more Black researchers into the field.\nIt takes a conference\nIn December 2017, the new Black in AI group hosted its first workshop at NeurIPS. While organizing the workshop, Gebru approached Joy Buolamwini, an MIT Media Lab researcher who was studying commercial facial recognition systems for possible bias. Buolamwini had begun testing these systems after one failed to detect her own face unless she donned a white mask. She submitted her preliminary results to the workshop.\nDeborah Raji, then an undergraduate researcher, was another early participant. Raji was appalled by the culture she’d observed at NeurIPS. The workshop became her respite. “To go from four or five days of that to a full day of people that look like me talking about succeeding in this space—it was such important encouragement for me,” she says.\nBuolamwini, Raji, and Gebru would go on to work together on a pair of groundbreaking studies about discriminatory computer-vision systems. Buolamwini and Gebru coauthored Gender Shades, which showed that the facial recognition systems sold by Microsoft, IBM, and Chinese tech giant Megvii had remarkably high failure rates on Black women despite near-perfect performance on white men. Raji and Buolamwini then collaborated on a follow-up called Actionable Auditing, which found the same to be true for Amazon’s Rekognition. In 2020, Amazon would agree to a one-year moratorium on police sales of its product, in part because of that work.\nAt the very first Black in AI workshop, though, these successes were distant possibilities. There was no agenda other than to build community and produce research based on their sorely lacking perspectives. Many onlookers didn’t understand why such a group needed to exist. Gebru remembers dismissive comments from some in the AI community. But for others, Black in AI pointed a new way forward.\nThis was true for William Agnew and Raphael Gontijo Lopes, both queer men conducting research in computer science, who realized they could form a Queer in AI group. (Other groups that took shape include Latinx in AI, {Dis}Ability in AI, and Muslim in ML.) For Agnew, in particular, having such a community felt like an urgent need. “It was hard to even imagine myself having a happy life,” he says, reflecting on the lack of queer role models in the field. “There’s Turing, but he committed suicide. So that’s depressing. And the queer part of him is just ignored.”\nNot all affinity group members see a connection between their identity and their research. Still, each group has established particular expertise. Black in AI has become the intellectual center for exposing algorithmic discrimination, critiquing surveillance, and developing data-efficient AI techniques. Queer in AI has become a center for contesting the ways algorithms infringe on people’s privacy and classify them into bounded categories by default.\nVenkatasubramanian and Gebru also helped create the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) conference to create a forum for research on the social and political implications of AI. Ideas and draft papers discussed at NeurIPS affinity group workshops often become the basis for papers published at FAccT, which then showcases that research to broader audiences.\nIt was after Buolamwini presented at the first Black in AI workshop, for example, that FAccT published Gender Shades. Along with Actionable Auditing, it then fueled several major education and advocacy campaigns to limit government use of facial recognition. When Amazon attempted to undermine the legitimacy of Buolamwini’s and Raji’s research, dozens of AI researchers and civil society organizations banded together to defend them, foreshadowing what they would later do for Gebru. Those efforts eventually contributed to Amazon’s moratorium, which in May the company announced it would extend indefinitely.\nThe research also set off a cascade of regulation. More than a dozen cities have banned police use of facial recognition, and Massachusetts now requires police to get a judge’s permission to use it. Both the US and the European Commission have proposed additional regulation.\n“First we had to just be there,” says Gebru. “And at some point, what Black in AI says starts to become important. And what all of these groups together say becomes important. You have to listen to us now.”\nFollow the money\nAfter Gebru and Mitchell’s firing, the field is grappling anew with an age-old question: Is it possible to change the status quo while working from within? Gebru still believes working with tech giants is the best way to identify the problems. But she also believes that corporate researchers need stronger legal protections. If they see risky practices, they should be able to publicly share their observations without jeopardizing their careers.\nThen there’s the question of funding. Many researchers want more investment from the US government to support work that is critical of commercial AI development and advances the public welfare. Last year, it committed a measly $1 billion to non-defense-related AI research. The Biden administration is now asking Congress to invest an additional $180 billion in emerging technologies, with AI as a top priority.\nSuch funding could help people like Rediet Abebe, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Abebe came into AI with ideas of using it to advance social equity. But when she started her PhD at Cornell, no one was focused on doing such research. \nIn the fall of 2016, as a PhD student, she began a small Cornell reading group with a fellow graduate student to study topics like housing instability, health-care access, and inequality. She then embarked on a new project to see whether her computational skills could support efforts to alleviate poverty.\nEventually, she found the Poverty Tracker study, a detailed data set on the financial shocks—unexpected expenses like medical bills or parking tickets—experienced by more than 2,000 New York families. Over many conversations with the study’s authors, social workers, and nonprofits serving marginalized communities, she learned about their needs and told them how she could help. Abebe then developed a model that showed how the frequency and type of shocks affected a family’s economic status. \nFive years later, the project is still ongoing. She’s now collaborating with nonprofits to improve her model and working with policymakers through the California Policy Lab to use it as a tool for preventing homelessness. Her reading group has also since grown into a 2,000-person community and is holding its inaugural conference later this year. \nAbebe sees it as a way to incentivize more researchers to flip the norms of AI. While traditional computer science conferences emphasize advancing computational techniques for the sake of doing so, the new one will publish work that first seeks to deeply understand a social issue. The work is no less technical, but it builds the foundation for more socially meaningful AI to emerge. \n“These changes that we’re fighting for—it’s not just for marginalized groups,” she says. “It’s actually for everyone.”","dc:creator":"Karen Hao","content":"Timnit Gebru never thought a scientific paper would cause her so much trouble.&#160; In 2020, as the co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, Gebru had reached out to Emily Bender, a linguistics professor at the University of Washington, and asked to collaborate on research about the troubling direction of artificial intelligence.

In my experience, it is not uncommon that Developers focus their work on a subsection of the value creation process, the coding itself. However, to maximize the value created from the work of the Scrum team, the Developers need to get comfortable with two principles:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n\t<li>They need to involve themselves in the product discovery process as early as possible, for example, by actively supporting customers at the help desk or by running user interviews. Writing code is only the last step of the process, once you have figured out what is worth building.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Another area prone to Developer blunders is establishing a collective responsibility for the product quality and keeping technical debt at bay. Attitudes like “works on my machine” or “we can ship it, just write a bug ticket for the remaining two issues” will not be sustainable. </li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p> \r\n\r\n<p>Let us delve into three Developer blunders, all of which a Scrum team can address themselves in an indeed “<a href=\"https://www.liberatingstructures.com/7-15-solutions/\" title=\"Liberating Structures: 15 % Solutuions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">15 % Solution</a>” spirit: </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Developers Focus on Coding</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Developers focus on delivering “code” and only code. They have no interest in talking to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, the Developers are missing an essential part of the value creation process of a Scrum team. The Manifesto for Agile Software Development describes it as follows: “<a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html\" rel=„noopener\" title=\"Agile Manifesto\" target=\"_blank\">Simplicity&#8211;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done&#8211;is essential</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/developer-blunders-making-your-scrum-work-14/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Works on My Machine, or: We Will Fix it in Post</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The trust of the Scrum team in its own creation is so low that they run “hardening Sprints” from time to time to improve the overall quality of the product. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one thing that comes to mind regarding Scrum, it is the relentless focus on quality, expressed in the Definition of Done and delivered with every Increment. As a Scrum team, our quality goals never decrease; there is no cutting corner whatsoever, such as “it works on my machine.” Whatever we create, we adhere to our Definition of Done; there is no need to fix issues later in production as we do not ship undone work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, a hardening Sprint is commonly a sign of a low grade of adoption of agile principles by the Scrum team or the organization. There are plenty of reasons for that; for example, the Scrum team is not yet cross-functional or at an early stage of its Scrum adoption.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. While it is common to first look outside our team for impediments, such as dysfunctional processes or other systemic issues, I would advise starting with the Scrum team’s way of collaboration: Are we aligned on the why, what, and how? Otherwise, the three following Developer blunders may diminish the team effectiveness.\n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of these Scrum Developer blunders and what you can do about them in a little more than five minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more us on July 6, 2021, for the Hands-on Agile #32: How to Win with Agile Resistant Teams—Scott Weiner.\n\r\n\r\nThe Accountability of the Developers According to the Scrum Guide\n\r\n\r\nThe Developers bear a mission-critical responsibility: they create the Product Increments designed to provide continuously more value to our customers:\n\r\n\r\n\nDevelopers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nThe specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCreating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n\r\n\t\nInstilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nAdapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n\r\n\t\nHolding each other accountable as professionals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, as the Scrum Team is self-managing, the Developers decide how they plan to do this. The Scrum Guide lists this critical element of the Developers’ contribution to a Scrum Team’s effectiveness in another section, the Sprint Planning:\n\r\n\r\n\nNo one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloper Blunders: Autonomy without Accountability Diminishes Value Creation\n\r\n\r\n“With great power comes great responsibility” is a suitable introduction to the root cause of the following three Developer blunders. In my experience, it is not uncommon that Developers focus their work on a subsection of the value creation process, the coding itself. However, to maximize the value created from the work of the Scrum team, the Developers need to get comfortable with two principles:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThey need to involve themselves in the product discovery process as early as possible, for example, by actively supporting customers at the help desk or by running user interviews. Writing code is only the last step of the process, once you have figured out what is worth building.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nAnother area prone to Developer blunders is establishing a collective responsibility for the product quality and keeping technical debt at bay. Attitudes like “works on my machine” or “we can ship it, just write a bug ticket for the remaining two issues” will not be sustainable. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n \r\n\r\nLet us delve into three Developer blunders, all of which a Scrum team can address themselves in an indeed “15 % Solution” spirit: \n\r\n\r\nThe Developers Focus on Coding\n\r\n\r\nThe Developers focus on delivering “code” and only code. They have no interest in talking to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the Developers are missing an essential part of the value creation process of a Scrum team. The Manifesto for Agile Software Development describes it as follows: “Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.”\n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nWorks on My Machine, or: We Will Fix it in Post\n\r\n\r\nThe trust of the Scrum team in its own creation is so low that they run “hardening Sprints” from time to time to improve the overall quality of the product. \n\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that comes to mind regarding Scrum, it is the relentless focus on quality, expressed in the Definition of Done and delivered with every Increment. As a Scrum team, our quality goals never decrease; there is no cutting corner whatsoever, such as “it works on my machine.” Whatever we create, we adhere to our Definition of Done; there is no need to fix issues later in production as we do not ship undone work.\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, a hardening Sprint is commonly a sign of a low grade of adoption of agile principles by the Scrum team or the organization. There are plenty of reasons for that; for example, the Scrum team is not yet cross-functional or at an early stage of its Scrum adoption. Alternatively, the “QA department” may still be a functional, non-agile silo. The organization’s incentive structures probably favor the output of the individual over the outcome of the Scrum team. (Which often results in the creation of a feature factory, accumulating technical debt.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGold-Plating, or: Why Over-Delivering Is an Indicator for the Developers’ Lack of Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThis Scrum anti-pattern is easy to spot: The Developers increase the Sprint’s scope by adding unnecessary effort to work items of Sprint Backlog, also referred to as scope-stretching or gold-plating beyond Done. Typically, this is done without prior consulting of the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nThis ignorance of previously made agreements during the refinement process may result in a questionable allocation of resources by neglecting basic business principles like considering opportunity costs.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about when faced with gold-plating? Try to address the following issues in the next Sprint Retrospective:\n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nAre Developers and the Product Owner talking often enough with each other, is the Product Backlog refinement process up to the job?  \u000b\n\r\n\t\nAre the Developers aware that it is their responsibility to make sound investment decisions when creating Product Increments? Good enough, as in “meets the Definition of Done and the intended purpose,” is a viable approach. It does not always need to be the most elegant, best possible quality solution as long as the Increment delivers the intended value. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably, you also want to analyze whether decisions made in the past, for example, the design of extended software architecture, are now driving decisions. So, for example, developers might be doubling down to underline that the previous decision was correct. \n\r\n\r\nFinally, as we are all humans, brace for the occasional over-excitement on the Developers’ side. Sometimes, a third and brand-new JavaScript framework is simply needed in your application. #sigh\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Developer Blunders — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\n“With great power comes great responsibility” is an excellent mantra for Scrum Developers. Professionalism here means to accept accountability for making many investment decisions, which requires looking beyond mere coding from day one. The good news is that Scrum teams can deal with many challenges on that path themselves—it is a question of collaboration and alignment among team members.\n\r\n\r\nHave you noticed home-grown Developer blunders or organizational dysfunctions that lead to those?

profile</a> (for marketing)</li></ul><p>Alright, let’s get into it.</p><h3>Hello product manager #28, how did YOU break into product?</h3><p>In 2017, I had a terrible and tragic accident: I became a product manager. I didn’t plan it—it just happened. And that’s the last thing an aspiring product manager wants to hear.</p><p>Yet aspiring product managers ask me over and over again how I broke into product management. Madness, I tell you!</p><figure><img alt=\"madness gif\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*5sYfSe_tl64JyA_pn4kSYw.gif\" /></figure><p>Aspiring product managers have figured out, though, they can’t possibly forge their own path to becoming a product manager based on one unique data point. So those clever creatures have taken to talking to 10, 20 or 30 product managers to find out how each one landed the role.</p><p>Pretty shrewd, I’ll admit, but it routinely killed me to see how much repetitive primary research and reinventing of the wheel these aspiring product managers were doing. So I figured I’d do my part for the community by completing my own round of 10 to 20 product manager interviews and then documenting the findings in a blog post.</p><p>I’d had it in my mind to self-publish a book someday after reading the book <a href=\"https://nathanbarry.com/authority/\">Authority</a> by Nathan Barry in early 2020. But I would’ve laughed and rolled away on my own newly reinvented wheel had you told me I’d end up self-publishing my first book that same year.</p><p>*stares at the imaginary wheel for an awkward amount of time before moving on*</p><h3>Seeking out product managers I didn’t already know</h3><p>My goal was to interview product managers I didn’t already know. So I reached out to the following communities:</p><p>By mid-April 2020, I’d interviewed product managers all across the world in Canada, the United States, Singapore, Philippines, Israel, India and the United Kingdom.</p><h3>I’m sorry, you did WHAT before you became a product manager?</h3><p>I always knew product managers came from a variety of professional backgrounds. But I nearly fell off that newly reinvented wheel I told you about when I saw how insanely different each product manager’s story was.</p><figure><img alt=\"Shock gif\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*NyoUH70z4Ge_dVkwrepE2Q.gif\" /></figure><p>Here are some examples of what these people did before becoming product managers:</p><ul><li>Owned a comic book store for 10 years.</li><li>Worked in a yogurt factory as a process engineer.</li><li>Worked in commercial banking as an underwriter.</li></ul><p>I won’t spoil the book but you get the picture. And that’s when I knew: global pandemic or not, it was time to write my first book.</p><h3>Retreating to my comfort zone (no, I’m not a masochist)</h3><p>I know self-publishing a book probably isn’t your idea of returning to your comfort zone—but it was for me.</p><p>You see, one month prior to this, I’d quit my job as an innovation product manager and thrown myself into entrepreneurship (you can read more about that <a href=\"https://www.lenasesardic.com/blog/entrepreneurial-rollercoaster\">here</a>.)</p><p>While working on my first ever product idea, I took quite the beating from the entrepreneurial Gods (I also documented that <a href=\"https://www.lenasesardic.com/blog/how-i-tested-my-first-product-idea-as-an-early-entrepreneur\">here</a>.) So I needed to seek refuge in something I knew was my strength: writing.</p><p>My father has written several books—he’s even dedicated a few to me, which I’ve never read (yup, I’m a great daughter.) If I’d inherited his terrible sense of humour, surely I’d inherited his wonderful writing style too, right? Right.</p><h3>Declaring a public deadline</h3><p>I set a deadline of September 1, 2020, to self-publish my book and nervously announced it on LinkedIn and Twitter. I named it The Making of Product Managers.</p><p>I bought the custom domain <a href=\"https://themakingofproductmanagers.com/\">themakingofproductmanagers.com</a> from <a href=\"http://godaddy\">GoDaddy</a> and created a simple landing page in <a href=\"https://carrd.co/\">carrd.co</a> with a sign-up form.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-g7EnL4zWHh-3rXT.gif\" /></figure><p>I then connected the sign-up form to <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a> to send updates to my email list. And around June 2020, I started posting about the book on my LinkedIn profile, my Twitter profile and in Slack groups related to product management.</p><h3>Did you know you wanted to be a product manager before or after you were conceived?</h3><p>Based on my research, I knew aspiring product managers faced a lot of doubt about how long it would take them to become product managers. And whether they were headed in the right direction.</p><p>That’s where I felt a lot of the existing product manager stories out there fell short—they usually only covered what the product manager had done right before they became a product manager.</p><p>I decided my stories would be different. I’d represent each product manager’s entire career from when they graduated university to when they became a product manager.</p><p>It was crucial to show these aspiring product managers that no story was a straight line and each one involved several moments of doubt. What they were feeling was normal, albeit not pleasant.</p><h3>The dreaded follow-up interviews</h3><p>Recounting your career to someone is hard. But reading your notes from when someone recounted their career to you is like… putting together a spaceship puzzle you got from China during a global pandemic and the wrong pieces still fit together.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*wWaCuySZMKylsbQS3DbaKg.gif\" /></figure><p>I finally scraped together the courage to ask a few product managers for follow-up interviews (and threw out that stupid spaceship puzzle in a frenzy.)</p><p>Surprisingly nobody got shot and instead, we jumped on a few Zoom calls and I got back to writing.</p><p>When people like your mission, they’ll happily offer you their time. No need to freak out and start throwing out spaceship puzzles from China.</p><h3>He said me haffi write, write, write, write, write…</h3><p>I basically wrote all of May, June, July and August. The 2020 lockdown did more than prevent the spread of COVID-19—it kept me writing.</p><p>By mid-July, I was sharing early drafts of each product manager’s story with them and iterating on their feedback.</p><p>Co-editing with my interviewees was a blast. Each one contributed to the finished product in their own way and made it that much better.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>One product manager added subheadings to her story, making it much easier to read. I later added subheadings to all the stories.</li><li>A few product managers pushed back on some details I’d included they felt were irrelevant to their stories, making the stories more focused.</li><li>Most interviewees preferred to stay anonymous so one product manager suggested I only use first names.</li></ul><p>Finally, I slapped one of the stories on the landing page as a free sample story ( <a href=\"https://www.lenasesardic.com/blog/michael\">Michael’s story</a>) and started sharing it with people to get feedback.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*P3KzkNdusTk--Olm.png\" /></figure><p>Fun fact: it’s pretty hard to get honest feedback for a sample story of the first-ever book you’ve written you’re also unemployed because you’re trying to be an “entrepreneur” during a global pandemic. I had to practically force it out of people.</p><h3>The birth of the final chapter, Takeaways</h3><p>I’d always planned to write a short conclusion at the end of the book. But while writing the individual stories, I discovered clear patterns and themes across all the stories. After mapping them all out, I realized they formed almost a blueprint of how to break into product management.</p><p>The result was the final chapter of the book, Takeaways: eight actionable lessons about how to break into product management.</p><h3>A fully home-grown project</h3><p>The only cost I incurred while writing the book was a $150 annual <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com\">Grammarly</a> subscription. Everything else was done in-house, for free.</p><p>My boyfriend (now husband) designed the front cover from scratch in <a href=\"https://inkscape.org/\">Inkscape</a>:</p><figure><img alt=\"Design iterations of book front cover\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mMVOMjXZEzEJqDVwQJ7zcw.png\" /><figcaption>Design iterations that led to the final front cover design</figcaption></figure><p>He also designed the informational boxes within each story:</p><figure><img alt=\"Sample informational box from book\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/531/0*ZtZ6xwy5TZltnDe-.png\" /><figcaption>Sample informational box from Filza’s story in The Making of Product Managers</figcaption></figure><p>I managed to find two excellent editors in Zagreb, Croatia who loved my mission so much they were willing to work for free! Okay, fine, they were my parents. And I’d like to think it was our way of staying connected during a global pandemic. Or a strange family project they had no way of backing out of.</p><p>I have to hand it to my mother though—that woman edited every single story <em>at least twice</em>. Mothers are just a different breed.</p><h3>The best editing advice you’ll ever get</h3><p>Read your writing out loud. That’s it. That’s the best editing advice you’ll ever get.</p><p>It’s comical how good our writing sounds in our head. Compared to when you read it aloud and catch so many errors and lack of flow.</p><p>When I first read one of the stories out loud to my husband, I actually couldn’t even finish reading it because I went into a giant laughing fit from how awful it sounded. Super choppy, full of repetitions and ridiculously robotic.</p><p>(It felt good to laugh uncontrollably for once at a time when it felt like the world was falling apart.)</p><p>Apparently, my favourite word to repeat excessively was “stakeholders.” If you’re in product management, you know how much we love to drown on about stakeholder this, stakeholder that… and the occasional “stakeholder you!” when we’re angry.</p><h3>I spent $0 on marketing</h3><p>On the marketing side of things, I didn’t do any paid marketing. Here’s what I did instead:</p><ul><li>Dripped content from the book to LinkedIn and Twitter</li><li>Posted the sample story in seven different Slack communities</li><li>Advertised the book on my personal website <a href=\"http://lenasesardic.com/\">lenasesardic.com</a></li><li>Spoke on six podcasts about how I wrote the book and key insights from it (you can check out <a href=\"https://itx.com/49-equifinality-many-paths-to-product-management/\">my interview on the Product Momentum podcast</a>)</li><li>Published another sample story (<a href=\"https://www.lenasesardic.com/blog/negar\">Negar’s story</a>) on my website in February 2021 and contributed both sample stories to <a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/\">Product Coalition</a>, a Medium publication)</li><li>Participated in four speaking engagements related to breaking into product management (and offered some discounts)</li></ul><p>Another fun fact: my first ever sale came from a product manager from Nigeria who has since then started working for a company in Oregon, United States (hey, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darealseun/\">Seun Faluyi</a>!)</p><p>Coolest first sale ever.</p><p>By the way, here’s a special discount code for you for being kind enough to read this very long retrospective blog post: <strong>productcoalition4life</strong>. You can use it <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/jEZGO\">here</a> to get $2 off the book (PDF or EPUB)—you’re welcome.</p><h3>I really didn’t do it for the money</h3><p>This was always a passion project for me. And a way for me to leave a concrete deliverable behind while embarking on my entrepreneurial journey. Turns out I got way more from the experience than I ever bargained for:</p><p>I met 19 amazing individuals from across the world, one of whom has become a close friend (hey, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/negaramiri/\">Negar Amiri</a>!)</p><p>It gave me the opportunity to mentor 30+ aspiring product managers and watch many of them successfully break into product management (like my most recent mentee, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-ferreira-cfp/\">Chris Ferreira</a>!)</p><p>It gave me meaning and fulfillment during a difficult and isolating time.</p><p>I got to finally follow in my father’s footsteps and write a book.</p><p>I got to connect with other writers like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zenorocha\">Zeno Rocha</a> who self-published <a href=\"https://14habits.com/\">14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers</a> and <a href=\"https://14habits.com/\">April Hernandez Castillo</a> who published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Embracing-Me-April-Hernandez-Castillo/dp/1732550751\">Embracing Me: A Memoir</a>.</p><p>I got invitations to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Embracing-Me-April-Hernandez-Castillo/dp/1732550751\">speaking engagements at events and on podcasts</a> for the first time in my life.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FYiHzzmhmSzw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYiHzzmhmSzw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FYiHzzmhmSzw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ea39ab73b9aca7ce9ea0b45b2400f8c2/href\">https://medium.com/media/ea39ab73b9aca7ce9ea0b45b2400f8c2/href</a></iframe><p>But the best part was discovering my love for writing. And I’m truly grateful for that.</p><h3>What I wish I’d done better (full disclosure)</h3><p>And now for the part you’re probably most interested in: a laundry list of all my mistakes and the things I could’ve done differently:</p><p>I wish I’d gotten beta readers for early feedback.</p><p>I wish I’d built in public more on LinkedIn and Twitter and shared updates along the way. I would’ve built up more of an audience and gotten more feedback during the process.</p><p>A few months later I got really into the #buildinpublic movement on Twitter and wish I’d started doing it sooner.</p><p>I wish I’d done pre-sales on <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/\">Gumroad</a> and used a bit of hype to drive up sales before the launch.</p><p>I wish I’d gotten more help with creating a compelling landing page. In hindsight, my landing page was not great—bland design, weak copy and not enough information about the book. In November 2020, I actually completely redesigned my landing page to make it more eye-catching and to showcase the book more.

I didn’t plan it—it just happened. And that’s the last thing an aspiring product manager wants to hear.\nYet aspiring product managers ask me over and over again how I broke into product management. Madness, I tell you!\n\nAspiring product managers have figured out, though, they can’t possibly forge their own path to becoming a product manager based on one unique data point. So those clever creatures have taken to talking to 10, 20 or 30 product managers to find out how each one landed the role.\nPretty shrewd, I’ll admit, but it routinely killed me to see how much repetitive primary research and reinventing of the wheel these aspiring product managers were doing. So I figured I’d do my part for the community by completing my own round of 10 to 20 product manager interviews and then documenting the findings in a blog post.\nI’d had it in my mind to self-publish a book someday after reading the book Authority by Nathan Barry in early 2020. But I would’ve laughed and rolled away on my own newly reinvented wheel had you told me I’d end up self-publishing my first book that same year.\n*stares at the imaginary wheel for an awkward amount of time before moving on*\nSeeking out product managers I didn’t already know\nMy goal was to interview product managers I didn’t already know. So I reached out to the following communities:\nBy mid-April 2020, I’d interviewed product managers all across the world in Canada, the United States, Singapore, Philippines, Israel, India and the United Kingdom.\nI’m sorry, you did WHAT before you became a product manager?\nI always knew product managers came from a variety of professional backgrounds. But I nearly fell off that newly reinvented wheel I told you about when I saw how insanely different each product manager’s story was.\n\nHere are some examples of what these people did before becoming product managers:\n\nOwned a comic book store for 10 years.\nWorked in a yogurt factory as a process engineer.\nWorked in commercial banking as an underwriter.\n\nI won’t spoil the book but you get the picture. And that’s when I knew: global pandemic or not, it was time to write my first book.\nRetreating to my comfort zone (no, I’m not a masochist)\nI know self-publishing a book probably isn’t your idea of returning to your comfort zone—but it was for me.\nYou see, one month prior to this, I’d quit my job as an innovation product manager and thrown myself into entrepreneurship (you can read more about that here.)\nWhile working on my first ever product idea, I took quite the beating from the entrepreneurial Gods (I also documented that here.) So I needed to seek refuge in something I knew was my strength: writing.\nMy father has written several books—he’s even dedicated a few to me, which I’ve never read (yup, I’m a great daughter.) If I’d inherited his terrible sense of humour, surely I’d inherited his wonderful writing style too, right? Right.\nDeclaring a public deadline\nI set a deadline of September 1, 2020, to self-publish my book and nervously announced it on LinkedIn and Twitter. I named it The Making of Product Managers.\nI bought the custom domain themakingofproductmanagers.com from GoDaddy and created a simple landing page in carrd.co with a sign-up form.\n\nI then connected the sign-up form to Mailchimp to send updates to my email list. And around June 2020, I started posting about the book on my LinkedIn profile, my Twitter profile and in Slack groups related to product management.\nDid you know you wanted to be a product manager before or after you were conceived?\nBased on my research, I knew aspiring product managers faced a lot of doubt about how long it would take them to become product managers. And whether they were headed in the right direction.\nThat’s where I felt a lot of the existing product manager stories out there fell short—they usually only covered what the product manager had done right before they became a product manager.\nI decided my stories would be different. I’d represent each product manager’s entire career from when they graduated university to when they became a product manager.\nIt was crucial to show these aspiring product managers that no story was a straight line and each one involved several moments of doubt. What they were feeling was normal, albeit not pleasant.\nThe dreaded follow-up interviews\nRecounting your career to someone is hard. But reading your notes from when someone recounted their career to you is like… putting together a spaceship puzzle you got from China during a global pandemic and the wrong pieces still fit together.\n\nI finally scraped together the courage to ask a few product managers for follow-up interviews (and threw out that stupid spaceship puzzle in a frenzy.)\nSurprisingly nobody got shot and instead, we jumped on a few Zoom calls and I got back to writing.\nWhen people like your mission, they’ll happily offer you their time. No need to freak out and start throwing out spaceship puzzles from China.\nHe said me haffi write, write, write, write, write…\nI basically wrote all of May, June, July and August. The 2020 lockdown did more than prevent the spread of COVID-19—it kept me writing.\nBy mid-July, I was sharing early drafts of each product manager’s story with them and iterating on their feedback.\nCo-editing with my interviewees was a blast. Each one contributed to the finished product in their own way and made it that much better.\nHere are some examples:\n\nOne product manager added subheadings to her story, making it much easier to read. I later added subheadings to all the stories.\nA few product managers pushed back on some details I’d included they felt were irrelevant to their stories, making the stories more focused.\nMost interviewees preferred to stay anonymous so one product manager suggested I only use first names.\n\nFinally, I slapped one of the stories on the landing page as a free sample story ( Michael’s story) and started sharing it with people to get feedback.\n\nFun fact: it’s pretty hard to get honest feedback for a sample story of the first-ever book you’ve written you’re also unemployed because you’re trying to be an “entrepreneur” during a global pandemic. I had to practically force it out of people.\nThe birth of the final chapter, Takeaways\nI’d always planned to write a short conclusion at the end of the book. But while writing the individual stories, I discovered clear patterns and themes across all the stories. After mapping them all out, I realized they formed almost a blueprint of how to break into product management.\nThe result was the final chapter of the book, Takeaways: eight actionable lessons about how to break into product management.\nA fully home-grown project\nThe only cost I incurred while writing the book was a $150 annual Grammarly subscription. Everything else was done in-house, for free.\nMy boyfriend (now husband) designed the front cover from scratch in Inkscape:\nDesign iterations that led to the final front cover design\nHe also designed the informational boxes within each story:\nSample informational box from Filza’s story in The Making of Product Managers\nI managed to find two excellent editors in Zagreb, Croatia who loved my mission so much they were willing to work for free! Okay, fine, they were my parents. And I’d like to think it was our way of staying connected during a global pandemic. Or a strange family project they had no way of backing out of.\nI have to hand it to my mother though—that woman edited every single story at least twice. Mothers are just a different breed.\nThe best editing advice you’ll ever get\nRead your writing out loud. That’s it. That’s the best editing advice you’ll ever get.\nIt’s comical how good our writing sounds in our head. Compared to when you read it aloud and catch so many errors and lack of flow.\nWhen I first read one of the stories out loud to my husband, I actually couldn’t even finish reading it because I went into a giant laughing fit from how awful it sounded. Super choppy, full of repetitions and ridiculously robotic.\n(It felt good to laugh uncontrollably for once at a time when it felt like the world was falling apart.)\nApparently, my favourite word to repeat excessively was “stakeholders.” If you’re in product management, you know how much we love to drown on about stakeholder this, stakeholder that… and the occasional “stakeholder you!” when we’re angry.\nI spent $0 on marketing\nOn the marketing side of things, I didn’t do any paid marketing. Here’s what I did instead:\n\nDripped content from the book to LinkedIn and Twitter\nPosted the sample story in seven different Slack communities\nAdvertised the book on my personal website lenasesardic.com\nSpoke on six podcasts about how I wrote the book and key insights from it (you can check out my interview on the Product Momentum podcast)\nPublished another sample story (Negar’s story) on my website in February 2021 and contributed both sample stories to Product Coalition, a Medium publication)\nParticipated in four speaking engagements related to breaking into product management (and offered some discounts)\n\nAnother fun fact: my first ever sale came from a product manager from Nigeria who has since then started working for a company in Oregon, United States (hey, Seun Faluyi!)\nCoolest first sale ever.\nBy the way, here’s a special discount code for you for being kind enough to read this very long retrospective blog post: productcoalition4life. You can use it here to get $2 off the book (PDF or EPUB)—you’re welcome.\nI really didn’t do it for the money\nThis was always a passion project for me. And a way for me to leave a concrete deliverable behind while embarking on my entrepreneurial journey. Turns out I got way more from the experience than I ever bargained for:\nI met 19 amazing individuals from across the world, one of whom has become a close friend (hey, Negar Amiri!)\nIt gave me the opportunity to mentor 30+ aspiring product managers and watch many of them successfully break into product management (like my most recent mentee, Chris Ferreira!)\nIt gave me meaning and fulfillment during a difficult and isolating time.\nI got to finally follow in my father’s footsteps and write a book.\nI got to connect with other writers like Zeno Rocha who self-published 14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers and April Hernandez Castillo who published Embracing Me: A Memoir.\nI got invitations to speaking engagements at events and on podcasts for the first time in my life.\nhttps://medium.com/media/ea39ab73b9aca7ce9ea0b45b2400f8c2/href\nBut the best part was discovering my love for writing. And I’m truly grateful for that.\nWhat I wish I’d done better (full disclosure)\nAnd now for the part you’re probably most interested in: a laundry list of all my mistakes and the things I could’ve done differently:\nI wish I’d gotten beta readers for early feedback.\nI wish I’d built in public more on LinkedIn and Twitter and shared updates along the way. I would’ve built up more of an audience and gotten more feedback during the process.\nA few months later I got really into the #buildinpublic movement on Twitter and wish I’d started doing it sooner.\nI wish I’d done pre-sales on Gumroad and used a bit of hype to drive up sales before the launch.\nI wish I’d gotten more help with creating a compelling landing page. In hindsight, my landing page was not great—bland design, weak copy and not enough information about the book. In November 2020, I actually completely redesigned my landing page to make it more eye-catching and to showcase the book more. You can check out the new landing page here.\nMy biggest regret, though, is not bringing more of my personality and humour into my writing. Writing about other people was stressful; I didn’t want to risk taking away from each product manager’s story or come off as disrespectful. So I stuck to writing in a really safe way without much humour.\nBut that’s the point of failing—you learn painful lessons and you never want to repeat them again.\nSince then, I’ve found my voice as a writer and am able to bring my true self (quirky humour and all) into my writing. And that’s how I really ended up falling in love with writing.\nWhat I’m doing today for my book\nAt the heart of it, I’ve gotten what I wanted out of self-publishing my book—I wrote an entire book, I met new people, I opened new doors and I became a real writer. Anything else I do with my book is just additional experimentation and a chance to learn something new.\nI have a call scheduled with a top copywriter from GrowthMentor soon to get feedback on the existing copy on my landing page and improve it so it converts better.

And if I can get the cost per click to make sense, I’ll happily continue to run ads to drive more sales.\nMy book, The Making of Product Managers, is essentially a vehicle I use to learn how to increase conversions and grow as a self-taught marketer.\nThe main takeaway\nYou don’t need to pay a fancy publisher or an expensive designer to publish a book. You can self-publish a book you’re proud of with just a Grammarly subscription and a small network of people who believe in your mission.\nAnd you don’t have to get everything right from the beginning.

Looking at long-term goals is definitely one of the things that make any strategy hard to build, but for product strategy that is not the hardest part.</p><h3>Fill the Void Between Vision and Action</h3><p>The goal of product strategy is to take the usually existing company vision or mission and bring it to life by explaining how the company and product are going to achieve that vision. Of course, in the process, the vision might be changed or refined, but it most likely wouldn’t be reinvented altogether. That’s why although CEOs sometimes tell me that they want the vision to come from the product leader, I believe that what they usually mean is that they want the product leader to take their own larger vision and <strong>shape it into something that the entire company can work with to bring this vision to life</strong>.</p><p>Since product strategy is so hard, many companies simply skip it. They define the bigger vision and immediately start acting upon it. In startups, it means building an MVP right away, and in larger companies, it would be yearly goals and initiatives that are pushed down to the people who need to execute on them. But as soon as you want to make sure that your actions will actually <strong>make the impact you want to make </strong>and achieve your vision or mission, something is missing.</p><p>The odds that everyone’s actions will miraculously translate into success without defining in advance how exactly it happens are really low. First, <a href=\"https://ganotnoa.com/your-problem-isnt-the-leaky-bucket-its-the-clogged-pipe/\">there are synergies that need to be created throughout everyone’s actions</a> to meet your goals. But even more importantly, the mere definition of what you are creating that will lead you there, is still too vague at the vision level.</p><h3>God Is in the Details</h3><p>To help everyone understand what they need to do, and make sure it leads you to where you want to be, you must create a strategy that includes at least the following:</p><p><strong>Detailed goals:</strong> it’s not enough to have an ARR goal, for example, because the real goal is probably reflected in more than the ARR number itself. The real goal can include small churn rates, market penetration goals (for example, at least X% of the ARR needs to come from a new market segment), new logos vs. expansion, and so on. If your goals aren’t detailed, it’s hard to make sure that they are met, and more importantly, it is hard to identify issues with the goals themselves (for example, unrealistic conversion rates that would be needed on your existing funnel or market, or price range that would be too high for your customers to pay but is the only way to meet the goal).</p><p>Even higher-level goals can be refined and detailed. For example, are we looking now to build the product that will make us a unicorn within the next five years, or are we looking to meet this year’s revenue goals despite a change in the market? Understanding these would make a major impact on the strategy you eventually choose, so you better generate that clarity from the get-go.</p><p><strong>What you are choosing to do:</strong> for product strategy, this means defining — in detail — which problem you want to solve for your customers (and for which customers exactly), and how your product (current or future) will actually solve it. <a href=\"https://ganotnoa.com/bring-your-product-to-life/\">You want to add color to this part</a>. You should be able to explain from your customer’s point of view what their pain points are, and how the lack of a solution impacts their lives. You should use their own words as much as possible, discuss their alternatives and explain — from their point of view — why they aren’t good enough. The <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1soQ9jUsOj31zGpa-QTjvqb3x3oNy1IzW/view?usp=sharing\">lean canvas</a> is a great thinking tool here when used the right way. I typically only focus on the parts at the top (Customer, Problem, Solution, Value Proposition, and Unfair Advantage) as the starting point. Everything else needs to be considered at a later phase.</p><p>In this part, you are seeking a definition of the customer problem that is worth solving. You can think about it as finding the easiest entry point into your vision, the foot at the door that you can set with the customer segment who needs you most. This is true for any business goals that deal with revenue — whether you are a startup on its way to product-market fit or already in the growth stage. If you are in a larger company, you might have other types of goals, like reducing operational costs and getting to profitability. Some of the impact here can be made from processes like operational excellence, but oftentimes the major impact comes from finding a problem or a market segment that can be served with higher margins, which leads us again to the detailed definition of the problem and the customer.</p><p>At the end of this part, make sure you have clear decisions and guidelines and not simply a generic description of the world.</p><p><strong>Why this is the right choice:</strong> this is the most overlooked part in strategy documents, albeit maybe the most important one.

This serves a number of purposes: first, writing it down helps you think. Second, it helps your readers understand, align and agree with you. And third, it serves as a knowledge base for future strategic decisions and can help you connect the dots even when things change. Make your product strategy document a journey that leads the reader to the inevitable conclusions that you should go in a certain direction. If you truly want it to be inevitable, you must explain what leads you to think this way at a very detailed level.</p><h3>Drill an Exploration Well</h3><p>The product strategy process is like seeking oil deep in the earth. You want to find oil, but you can’t be sure that you will until you drill very deep and find evidence that oil exists in the spot you were drilling in. This is called an exploration well, which is build and maintained differently from a product well that is meant to provide oil on an ongoing basis. The location of the exploration well is chosen based on geological markers, so that before you drill you have a reason to believe that oil indeed exists there. However it is only after drilling that you can know for sure, and in some cases, you won’t find it as easily as you hoped or even at all. In this case, if you still want to find oil, you will need to find another place with good potential, and drill a new exploration well there.</p><p>In our world, it means that to find the right customer problem to solve, you can’t stay on the surface. You must make the (informed) assumption that this is a <strong>potentially </strong>good problem, and work with it all the way until you feel you have either proved (on paper) that it is the right one, or reached a deadlock which means you must move elsewhere. I will write another article on how you know if it is indeed a good problem to solve. For now, I will say that if you can — at a very detailed level — explain why it is good both for your potential customers and for your company, then it is indeed a good problem to solve.</p><p>Note that this is still just on paper, so your effort here is meetings and writing and thinking, but not the development of the actual product at first. It’s not that the development isn’t part of the exploration, but when you use this very expensive resource make sure that you have a good reason to believe it would work. As I always say, not everything that works on paper works in reality, but <strong>if it doesn’t work on paper, it never will in the real world</strong>.

There was a KYC (Know Your Customer) module for the customer that we needed to develop for our offerings. There were some decisions that business went for about the KYC process. This accumulated a lot of technical debt. Technical debt (or tech debt for short) is built up of poor internal quality because of short-term decision making as <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html\">described by Martin Fowler</a>. Thus we needed to do a lot of re-work to streamline the system. As the existing solution was short-termed, we knew, we had to build a long-term, scalable solution.</p><p>This article is about how I inspired the team to address the technical debt issue. This helped them to choose a better approach going forward.</p><p>A few days back, I observed that we were facing a lot of re-work. I discussed this with the development team and Subject Matter Experts (SME). I could see how it would become unstable and soon our product would collapse! This was not the first time tech debt got my attention. I observed, since the last 5 sprints, we had to do frequent “bandage fix” for new issues coming. The Product Owner preferred to release new features over solving for tech debt items. Hence tech debt issues always lost the battle of urgency and priority. The Product Owner postponed them, sometimes for an indefinite time.</p><p>It was high time for us to fix them. Customers were facing an inordinate amount of delay in uploading the KYC documents. The customer grew impatient and felt reluctant to stay on the site. They also did not want to register for the scheme we were offering. This could have led to a severe business impact.</p><p>I discussed this issue with the team. To comfort the angry customers, it was clear that we urgently needed to look into tech debt issues and fix them. Our short-term thinking had led to customer dissatisfaction.</p><p>I knew I needed to inspire the team and, Sam, our Product Owner, to prioritize the burning tech debt items now. To make them aware, I decided to wear my coaching hat and pull up my sleeves, to get my hands dirty.</p><p>I scheduled a 1-hour session with the team. I intentionally named it “Celebrating my 20-pound happiness” to pique their interest.</p><p>I even arranged healthy snacks to ensure attendance.</p><p>Once everyone was there, I started my story:</p><p>“<em>A couple of months back, in our building one family was quarantined due to COVID infection. All our society members had decided not to use the elevator till it was fully sanitized and disinfected.

There was a KYC (Know Your Customer) module for the customer that we needed to develop for our offerings. There were some decisions that business went for about the KYC process. This accumulated a lot of technical debt. Technical debt (or tech debt for short) is built up of poor internal quality because of short-term decision making as described by Martin Fowler. Thus we needed to do a lot of re-work to streamline the system. As the existing solution was short-termed, we knew, we had to build a long-term, scalable solution.\nThis article is about how I inspired the team to address the technical debt issue. This helped them to choose a better approach going forward.\nA few days back, I observed that we were facing a lot of re-work. I discussed this with the development team and Subject Matter Experts (SME). I could see how it would become unstable and soon our product would collapse! This was not the first time tech debt got my attention. I observed, since the last 5 sprints, we had to do frequent “bandage fix” for new issues coming. The Product Owner preferred to release new features over solving for tech debt items. Hence tech debt issues always lost the battle of urgency and priority. The Product Owner postponed them, sometimes for an indefinite time.\nIt was high time for us to fix them. Customers were facing an inordinate amount of delay in uploading the KYC documents. The customer grew impatient and felt reluctant to stay on the site. They also did not want to register for the scheme we were offering. This could have led to a severe business impact.\nI discussed this issue with the team. To comfort the angry customers, it was clear that we urgently needed to look into tech debt issues and fix them. Our short-term thinking had led to customer dissatisfaction.\nI knew I needed to inspire the team and, Sam, our Product Owner, to prioritize the burning tech debt items now. To make them aware, I decided to wear my coaching hat and pull up my sleeves, to get my hands dirty.\nI scheduled a 1-hour session with the team. I intentionally named it “Celebrating my 20-pound happiness” to pique their interest.\nI even arranged healthy snacks to ensure attendance.\nOnce everyone was there, I started my story:\n“A couple of months back, in our building one family was quarantined due to COVID infection. All our society members had decided not to use the elevator till it was fully sanitized and disinfected. As our building is only 5 stories, and I’m staying on the 4th floor, it was not that difficult to follow this norm. When I started using the staircase for that day, I realized that I didn’t have the stamina which I had a year ago. Just after one round of staircase climbing, I was very tired and was panting. Thus I realized that I needed to do something to get that stamina back. In my hectic routine, it was really difficult to accommodate any sort of exercise. I knew that if I ignored this, someday, I would need to pay the cost of it! My heart condition would be deficient. My overall health would get affected. This was an alarming situation for me. Then I started using the staircase daily. After a week and a half, I felt that I could do one more exercise. Hence I added 200 skipping ropes every day. I tracked my stamina using my Fitbit and daily dairy. I also made some appropriate changes to my daily diet. I gradually regained my stamina and I could easily run up and down the stairs. Moreover, I stopped using the elevator altogether. So, after one month of this great journey, here I am 20-pounds lighter! It’s a great experience!”\n\nAfter this story, I invited everyone to share their fitness routine. The team shared it while munching on the healthy snacks.\nThen I slowly moved to our tech debt problem. So, while standing in front of everybody, I asked\n“Hey, these simple signs help us to steer our focus on long-term benefit right, Sam? (our PO)”\nSam said “yeah absolutely”\nand “we shouldn’t ignore these signs” George (our team lead) added.\nThen I pointed out “You know team, I guess these kinds of signs are always around us. We just need to be aware of them. For example, we saw our customers leaving our site within no time during the KYC document upload.

People hope that our bar burns down. It’s a name and shame campaign.” It wasn’t just the emails. Soon, his bar started receiving multiple one-star reviews on Yelp and Google Reviews from accounts as far away as Europe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spamming review portals with negative ratings is <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2021/01/23/yelp-now-lists-restaurants-coronavirus-policy-cracks-down-fake-reviews/4164727001/\">not a new phenomenon</a>. Throughout the pandemic, the tactic has also been deployed to attack bars and restaurants that enforced mask-wearing for safety. As pandemic restrictions have lifted, businesses like Mother’s Ruin have sought to ensure that safety by requiring proof of vaccination using state-sponsored apps like <a href=\"https://epass.ny.gov/home\">New York’s Excelsior Pass</a>, vaccine passports, or simply flashing vaccine cards at the door — practices that have instigated a second surge of spam reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These spam one-star reviews can be extremely damaging. The default mode for viewing reviews is in chronological order, from newest to oldest, which means a spam attack places fake reviews up top, making the most recent reviews that much more influential if you’re the victim of a concerted campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some companies have gotten around this issue on their own sites by verifying that reviewers are actual customers by reaching out to them via email and matching them with what they have on file, industry-leading platforms like Yelp and Google let anyone to rate and review a business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In April, Marshall Smith instituted what may have been the US’s first policy requiring patrons to <a href=\"https://www.westword.com/restaurants/bar-max-will-reopen-on-april-2-for-guests-who-have-received-vaccinations-11928640\">prove they were fully vaccinated</a> against coronavirus at Bar Max in Denver. He didn’t think it would be a big deal to ask customers to show their vaccination cards at the door. “I didn’t consider the politics, and perhaps that was naive on my part,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within days, his bar was slammed with one-star reviews on Google that took his average rating from 4.6 out of 5 stars to 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were in the top 10 best reviewed craft cocktail bars in Denver [pre-pandemic],” he says. “It might not sound significant but if you drop out of the first page of results, it’s a big deal: you’re out of top 10 lists, listicle mentions. We don’t do a lot of advertising because people look at our reviews. We’ve built six years of good reviews that’s been chiseled away over a matter of months.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These reviews don’t stay permanently in a business’s history. Yelp roots out spam, though the company “does not tell anybody [how its spam detection works]” says Bing Liu, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Liu was a co-author in 2013 of a <a href=\"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14389/14238\">paper</a> that attempted to replicate Yelp’s methods, finding that that company most likely used keywords to root out possible spammers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Smith’s Yelp reviews were shut down after the sudden flurry of activity on its page, which the company labels “unusual activity alerts,” a stopgap measure for both the business and Yelp to filter through a flood of reviews and pick out which are spam and which aren’t. Noorie Malik, Yelp’s vice president of user operations, said Yelp has a “team of moderators” that investigate pages that get an unusual amount of traffic. “After we’ve seen activity dramatically decrease or stop, we will then clean up the page so that only firsthand consumer experiences are reflected,” she said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a practice that Yelp has had to deploy more often over the course of the pandemic: According to <a href=\"https://trust.yelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yelp-Trust-and-Safety-Report-2020.pdf\">Yelp&#8217;s 2020 Trust &amp; Safety Report</a>, the company saw a 206% increase over 2019 levels in unusual activity alerts. “Since January 2021, we’ve placed more than 15 unusual activity alerts on business pages related to a business’s stance on covid-19 vaccinations,” said Malik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of those cases have been since May, like the gay bar C.C. Attles in Seattle, which got an <a href=\"https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2021/05/at-cc-attles-a-new-first-for-capitol-hill-bars-and-restaurants-covid-19-vaccination-required/\">alert from Yelp</a> after it made patrons show proof of vaccination at the door. Earlier this month, Moe’s Cantina in Chicago’s River North neighborhood got spammed after it attempted to isolate <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/restaurant-vaccinated-unvaccinated/\">vaccinated customers from unvaccinated </a>ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spamming a business with one-star reviews is not a new tactic. In fact, perhaps the best-known case is Colorado’s Masterpiece bakery, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-baker-who-turned-away-gay-couple.html\">won a 2018 Supreme Court battle</a> for refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, after which it got pummeled by one-star reviews. “People are still writing fake reviews. People will always write fake reviews,” Liu says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he adds that today’s online audience know that platforms use algorithms to detect and flag problematic words, so bad actors can mask their grievances by blaming poor restaurant service like a more typical negative review to ensure the rating stays up — and counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems to have been the case with Knapp’s bar. His Yelp review included comments like “There was hair in my food” or alleged cockroach sightings. “Really ridiculous, fantastic shit,” Knapp says. “If you looked at previous reviews, you would understand immediately that this doesn’t make sense.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liu also says there is a limit to how much Yelp can improve their spam detection, since natural language — or the way we speak, read, and write — “is very tough for computer systems to detect.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Liu doesn’t think putting a human being in charge of figuring out which reviews are spam or not will solve the problem. “Human beings can’t do it,” he says. “Some people might get it right, some people might get it wrong. I have fake reviews on my webpage and even I can’t tell which are real or not.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might notice that I’ve only mentioned Yelp reviews thus far, despite the fact that Google reviews — which appear in the business description box on the right side of the Google search results page under “reviews” — is arguably more influential. That’s because Google’s review operations are, frankly, even more mysterious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While businesses I spoke to said Yelp worked with them on identifying spam reviews, none of them had any luck with contacting Google’s team. “You would think Google would say, ‘Something is fucked up here,’” Knapp says. “These are IP addresses from overseas. It really undermines the review platform when things like this are allowed to happen.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Google did not respond to multiple requests for comment; however, within a few hours of our call, Knapp said some problematic reviews on Google had cleared up for him. Smith said he had not yet gotten any response from Google about reviews, save for automated responses saying that multiple reviews he had flagged did not qualify getting taken down because “the reviews in question don&#8217;t fall under any of the violation categories, according to our policies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam reviews aren’t going anywhere and will continue to be a problem for years to come. And the fact remains that online communities — like the European anti-vaxxers that descended upon Mother’s Ruin’s reviews — can destroy faraway livelihoods with the click of a star rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those ratings haunt business owners like Smith. “I still have folks putting one-star reviews on our Google listing,” he says. “Outliers pull down averages, that’s math. It’s a pretty effective means of attack for the folks who do this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knapp feels equally frustrated and helpless. “We’re just trying to survive through the most traumatic experience that’s ever hit the hospitality industry,” he says. “The idea that we are under attack by this community and there is no real vehicle to combat it, that’s frustrating.”</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"On the first hot weekend of the summer, Richard Knapp put up a sign outside Mother’s Ruin, a bar tucked in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood.

People will always write fake reviews,” Liu says.\nBut he adds that today’s online audience know that platforms use algorithms to detect and flag problematic words, so bad actors can mask their grievances by blaming poor restaurant service like a more typical negative review to ensure the rating stays up — and counts.\nThat seems to have been the case with Knapp’s bar. His Yelp review included comments like “There was hair in my food” or alleged cockroach sightings. “Really ridiculous, fantastic shit,” Knapp says. “If you looked at previous reviews, you would understand immediately that this doesn’t make sense.” \nLiu also says there is a limit to how much Yelp can improve their spam detection, since natural language — or the way we speak, read, and write — “is very tough for computer systems to detect.” \nBut Liu doesn’t think putting a human being in charge of figuring out which reviews are spam or not will solve the problem. “Human beings can’t do it,” he says. “Some people might get it right, some people might get it wrong. I have fake reviews on my webpage and even I can’t tell which are real or not.”\nYou might notice that I’ve only mentioned Yelp reviews thus far, despite the fact that Google reviews — which appear in the business description box on the right side of the Google search results page under “reviews” — is arguably more influential. That’s because Google’s review operations are, frankly, even more mysterious. \nWhile businesses I spoke to said Yelp worked with them on identifying spam reviews, none of them had any luck with contacting Google’s team. “You would think Google would say, ‘Something is fucked up here,’” Knapp says. “These are IP addresses from overseas. It really undermines the review platform when things like this are allowed to happen.”\nGoogle did not respond to multiple requests for comment; however, within a few hours of our call, Knapp said some problematic reviews on Google had cleared up for him. Smith said he had not yet gotten any response from Google about reviews, save for automated responses saying that multiple reviews he had flagged did not qualify getting taken down because “the reviews in question don’t fall under any of the violation categories, according to our policies.”\nSpam reviews aren’t going anywhere and will continue to be a problem for years to come. And the fact remains that online communities — like the European anti-vaxxers that descended upon Mother’s Ruin’s reviews — can destroy faraway livelihoods with the click of a star rating.\nThose ratings haunt business owners like Smith. “I still have folks putting one-star reviews on our Google listing,” he says. “Outliers pull down averages, that’s math. It’s a pretty effective means of attack for the folks who do this.”\nKnapp feels equally frustrated and helpless. “We’re just trying to survive through the most traumatic experience that’s ever hit the hospitality industry,” he says. “The idea that we are under attack by this community and there is no real vehicle to combat it, that’s frustrating.”","dc:creator":"Tanya Basu","content":"On the first hot weekend of the summer, Richard Knapp put up a sign outside Mother’s Ruin, a bar tucked in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood.

This week, we acknowledge that rebels spark ideas, and we consider whether OKRs can restore purpose to agile teams and free them from the tyranny of the Product Backlog. Moreover, we get an inside view of how Youtube managed its early hyper-growth, and we point at the advantages of using low-code tooling to build software: Iterating faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then address why the tech industry has such a high proportion of weak product managers and product leaders. We pitch the advantages of collaborative decision-making, leveraging both stakeholders’ and developers’ expertise while creating a shared understanding. Also, we share three tactics that have proven to impact getting buy-in from team members significantly.  </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we enjoy an interview with Christina Wodtke on how OKR can help product managers accomplish more, and we get curious about a new Scrum software: “HappyStack is a Scrum project software tool for developers: Backlog, Sprint Planning, Standups, Reviews, and Retros done the right way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-296-rebels-spark-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #296: Rebels Spark Ideas, Agile Rituals for Hyper-Growth, CSPO Pathology, Collaborative Product Decisions — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-66004\" data-wp-pid=\"66004\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-296-rebels-spark-ideas.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-296-rebels-spark-ideas-825x413.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-296-rebels-spark-ideas-800x400.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65999\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-295-overcoming-team-limits/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #295: Overcoming Team Limits, Pharma Success Story w/ Scrum, The Mediocrity Trap, Your Product is Not Their Problem\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #295</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like thikelly bels one?

This week, we acknowledge that rebels spark ideas, and we consider whether OKRs can restore purpose to agile teams and free them from the tyranny of the Product Backlog. Moreover, we get an inside view of how Youtube managed its early hyper-growth, and we point at the advantages of using low-code tooling to build software: Iterating faster.\n\r\n\r\nWe then address why the tech industry has such a high proportion of weak product managers and product leaders. We pitch the advantages of collaborative decision-making, leveraging both stakeholders’ and developers’ expertise while creating a shared understanding. Also, we share three tactics that have proven to impact getting buy-in from team members significantly.  \n \r\n\r\nLastly, we enjoy an interview with Christina Wodtke on how OKR can help product managers accomplish more, and we get curious about a new Scrum software: “HappyStack is a Scrum project software tool for developers: Backlog, Sprint Planning, Standups, Reviews, and Retros done the right way.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you miss the previous Food for Agile Thought’s issue #295?\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like thikelly bels one?

He isn’t a real person, but he’s meant to mimic one—as are the hundreds of thousands of others made by Datagen, a company that sells fake, simulated humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These humans are not gaming avatars or animated characters for movies. They are synthetic data designed to feed the growing appetite of deep-learning algorithms. Firms like Datagen offer a compelling alternative to the expensive and time-consuming process of gathering real-world data. They will make it for you: how you want it, when you want—and relatively cheaply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To generate its synthetic humans, <a href=\"https://www.datagen.tech/technology/\">Datagen</a> first scans actual humans. It partners with vendors who pay people to step inside giant full-body scanners that capture every detail from their irises to their skin texture to the curvature of their fingers. The startup then takes the raw data and pumps it through a series of algorithms, which develop 3D representations of a person’s body, face, eyes, and hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company, which is based in Israel, says it’s already working with four major US tech giants, though it won’t disclose which ones on the record. Its closest competitor, <a href=\"https://synthesis.ai/datasets/\">Synthesis AI</a>, also offers on-demand digital humans. Other companies generate data to be used in <a href=\"https://www.facteus.com/\">finance</a>, <a href=\"https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-for-insurance/\">insurance</a>, and <a href=\"https://synthea.mitre.org/\">health care</a>. There are about as many <a href=\"https://elise-deux.medium.com/the-list-of-synthetic-data-companies-2021-5aa246265b42\">synthetic-data companies</a> as there are types of data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once viewed as less desirable than real data, synthetic data is now seen by some as a panacea. Real data is messy and riddled with bias. New data privacy regulations make it hard to collect. By contrast, synthetic data is pristine and can be used to build more diverse data sets. You can produce perfectly labeled faces, say, of different ages, shapes, and ethnicities to build a face-detection system that works across populations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But synthetic data has its limitations. If it fails to reflect reality, it could end up producing even worse AI than messy, biased real-world data—or it could simply inherit the same problems. “What I don’t want to do is give the thumbs up to this paradigm and say, ‘Oh, this will solve so many problems,’” says Cathy O’Neil, a data scientist and founder of the algorithmic auditing firm ORCAA. “Because it will also ignore a lot of things.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Realistic, not real</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep learning has always been about data. But in the last few years, the AI community has learned that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021258/ai-pioneer-andrew-ng-machine-learning-business/\"><em>good</em></a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021258/ai-pioneer-andrew-ng-machine-learning-business/\"> data is more important than </a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021258/ai-pioneer-andrew-ng-machine-learning-business/\"><em>big </em></a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021258/ai-pioneer-andrew-ng-machine-learning-business/\">data</a>. Even small amounts of the right, cleanly labeled data can do more to improve an AI system’s performance than 10 times the amount of uncurated data, or even a more advanced algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That changes the way companies should approach developing their AI models, says Datagen’s CEO and cofounder, Ofir Chakon. Today, they start by acquiring as much data as possible and then tweak and tune their algorithms for better performance. Instead, they should be doing the opposite: use the same algorithm while improving on the composition of their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4e.gif?w=1280\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1026183\"/><figcaption>Datagen also generates fake furniture and indoor environments to put its fake humans in context.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">DATAGEN</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But collecting real-world data to perform this kind of iterative experimentation is too costly and time intensive. This is where Datagen comes in. With a synthetic data generator, teams can create and test dozens of new data sets a day to identify which one maximizes a model’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure the realism of its data, Datagen gives its vendors detailed instructions on how many individuals to scan in each age bracket, BMI range, and ethnicity, as well as a set list of actions for them to perform, like walking around a room or drinking a soda. The vendors send back both high-fidelity static images and motion-capture data of those actions. Datagen’s algorithms then expand this data into hundreds of thousands of combinations. The synthesized data is sometimes then checked again. Fake faces are plotted against real faces, for example, to see if they seem realistic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Datagen is now generating facial expressions to monitor driver alertness in smart cars, body motions to track customers in cashier-free stores, and irises and hand motions to improve the eye- and hand-tracking capabilities of VR headsets. The company says its data has already been used to develop computer-vision systems serving tens of millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just synthetic humans that are being mass-manufactured. <a href=\"https://www.click-ins.com/\">Click-Ins</a> is a startup that uses synthetic AI to perform automated vehicle inspections. Using design software, it re-creates all car makes and models that its AI needs to recognize and then renders them with different colors, damages, and deformations under different lighting conditions, against different backgrounds. This lets the company update its AI when automakers put out new models, and helps it avoid data privacy violations in countries where license plates are considered private information and thus cannot be present in photos used to train AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SD4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1026182\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SD4.jpg 1280w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SD4.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SD4.jpg?resize=768,576 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><figcaption>Click-Ins renders cars of different makes and models against various backgrounds.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">CLICK-INS</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mostly.ai/industries/\">Mostly.ai</a> works with financial, telecommunications, and insurance companies to provide spreadsheets of fake client data that let companies share their customer database with outside vendors in a legally compliant way.

This could be useful if, for example, a company only had data from New York City’s more youthful population but wanted to understand how its AI performs on an aging population with higher prevalence of diabetes. She’s now starting her own company, Bayesian Health, which will use this technique to help test medical AI systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The limits of faking it</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But is synthetic data overhyped?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to privacy, “just because the data is ‘synthetic’ and does not directly correspond to real user data does not mean that it does not encode sensitive information about real people,” says Aaron Roth, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. Some data generation techniques have been shown to closely reproduce images or text found in the training data, for example, while others are vulnerable to attacks that make them fully regurgitate that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might be fine for a firm like Datagen, whose synthetic data isn’t meant to conceal the identity of the individuals who consented to be scanned.

But skeptics worry that this nuance can be lost in the marketing lingo of synthetic-data vendors, which won’t always be forthcoming about what techniques they are using.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, little evidence suggests that synthetic data can effectively mitigate the bias of AI systems. For one thing, extrapolating new data from an existing data set that is skewed doesn’t necessarily produce data that’s more representative. Datagen’s raw data, for example, contains proportionally fewer ethnic minorities, which means it uses fewer real data points to generate fake humans from those groups. While the generation process isn’t entirely guesswork, those fake humans might still be more likely to diverge from reality. “If your darker-skin-tone faces aren’t particularly good approximations of faces, then you’re not actually solving the problem,” says O’Neil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For another, perfectly balanced data sets don’t automatically translate into perfectly fair AI systems, says Christo Wilson, an associate professor of computer science at Northeastern University. If a credit card lender were trying to develop an AI algorithm for scoring potential borrowers, it would not eliminate all possible discrimination by simply representing white people as well as Black people in its data. Discrimination could still creep in through differences between white and Black applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To complicate matters further, early research shows that in some cases, it may not even be possible to achieve both private <em>and </em>fair AI with synthetic data.

Combine that reluctance with the need to recruit patients who have relatively rare diseases—for example, a form of breast cancer characterized by a specific genetic marker—and the time to recruit enough people can stretch out for months, or even years.

B.1.617.2, which now goes by the name Delta, first emerged in India, but has since spread to 62 countries, according to the World Health Organization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delta is still rare in the US. At a press conference on Tuesday, the White House’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, said that it accounts for just 6% of cases. But in the UK it has quickly overtaken B.1.1.7—also known as Alpha—to become the dominant strain, which could derail the country’s plans to ease restrictions on June 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total number of cases is still small, but public health officials are watching the variant closely.&nbsp;On Monday, UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care&nbsp;Matt Hancock reported that Delta appears to be about 40% more transmissible than Alpha, but scientists are still trying to pin down the exact number—estimates range from 30% to 100%. They are also working to understand what makes it more infectious.&nbsp;They don’t yet have many answers, but they do have hypotheses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All viruses acquire mutations in their genetic code as they replicate, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Many of these mutations have no impact at all. But some change the virus’s structure or function. Identifying changes in the genetic sequence of a virus is simple. Figuring out how those changes impact the way a virus spreads is trickier. The spike protein, which helps the virus gain entry to cells, is a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Delta enters cells</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To infect cells, SARS-CoV-2 must enter the body and bind to receptors on the surface of cells. The virus is studded with mushroom-shaped spike proteins that latch onto a receptor called ACE2 on human cells. This receptor is found on many cell types, including those that line the lungs. Think of it like a key fitting into a lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutations that help the virus bind more tightly can make transmission from one person to another easier. Imagine you breathe in a droplet that contains SARS-CoV-2. If that droplet contains viruses with better binding capabilities, they “will be more efficient at finding and infecting one of your cells,” says Nathaniel Landau, a microbiologist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientists don’t yet know how many particles of SARS-CoV-2 you have to inhale to become infected, but the threshold would likely be lower for a virus that is better at grabbing onto ACE2. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Landau and his colleagues study binding in the lab by creating pseudoviruses. These lab-engineered viruses can’t replicate, but researchers can tweak them to express the spike protein on their surface. That allows them to easily test binding without needing to use a high-security laboratory. The researchers mix these pseudoviruses with plastic beads covered with ACE2 and then work out how much virus sticks to the beads. The greater the quantity of virus, the better the virus is at binding. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.444076v1.full\">a preprint posted in May</a>, Grunbaugh and colleagues show that some of the mutations present in Delta do enhance binding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How it infects once inside</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But better binding not only lowers the threshold for infection.

This kick starts the fusion machinery. If binding is like the key fitting in the lock, cleavage is like the key turning the deadbolt. “Without cuts at both sites, the virus can&#8217;t get into cells,” says Vineet Menachery, a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the mutations present in Delta actually occurs in one of these cleavage sites, and <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.28.446163v1.full.pdf\">a new study that has not yet been peer reviewed</a> shows that this mutation does enhance cleavage.

When scientists delete these cleavage sites, the virus becomes less transmissible and less pathogenic, Menachery says. So it stands to reason that changes that facilitate cleavage would increase transmissibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also possible that Delta’s ability to evade the body’s immune response helps fuel transmission. Immune evasion means more cells become infected and produce more virus, which then potentially makes it easier for person carrying that virus to infect someone else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But vaccines still work</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that vaccination provides strong protection against Delta.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses\">new study from Public Health England</a>&nbsp;shows that&nbsp;the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease due to Delta in fully vaccinated people. The AstraZeneca vaccine provided slightly less protection. Two shots were 60% effective against the variant. The effectiveness of one dose of either vaccine, however, was much lower— just 33%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, in the US and UK, just around 42% of the population is fully vaccinated. In India, where the virus surged fueled in part by the rapid spread of Delta, just 3.3% of the population has achieved full vaccination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the press briefing, Fauci urged those who have not been vaccinated to get their first shot and reminded those who are partially vaccinated not to skip their second dose. The Biden Administration hopes to have 70% of the population at least partially vaccinated by the Fourth of July. In the UK, Delta quickly replaced Alpha to become the dominant strain, and cases are now on the rise. “We cannot let that happen in the United States,” Fauci said.&nbsp;</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Covid cases are on the rise in England, and a fast-spreading variant may be to blame. B.1.617.2, which now goes by the name Delta, first emerged in India, but has since spread to 62 countries, according to the World Health Organization. \nDelta is still rare in the US. At a press conference on Tuesday, the White House’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, said that it accounts for just 6% of cases. But in the UK it has quickly overtaken B.1.1.7—also known as Alpha—to become the dominant strain, which could derail the country’s plans to ease restrictions on June 21.\nThe total number of cases is still small, but public health officials are watching the variant closely. On Monday, UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock reported that Delta appears to be about 40% more transmissible than Alpha, but scientists are still trying to pin down the exact number—estimates range from 30% to 100%. They are also working to understand what makes it more infectious. They don’t yet have many answers, but they do have hypotheses.\nAll viruses acquire mutations in their genetic code as they replicate, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Many of these mutations have no impact at all. But some change the virus’s structure or function. Identifying changes in the genetic sequence of a virus is simple. Figuring out how those changes impact the way a virus spreads is trickier. The spike protein, which helps the virus gain entry to cells, is a good place to start. \nHow Delta enters cells\nTo infect cells, SARS-CoV-2 must enter the body and bind to receptors on the surface of cells. The virus is studded with mushroom-shaped spike proteins that latch onto a receptor called ACE2 on human cells. This receptor is found on many cell types, including those that line the lungs. Think of it like a key fitting into a lock.\nMutations that help the virus bind more tightly can make transmission from one person to another easier. Imagine you breathe in a droplet that contains SARS-CoV-2. If that droplet contains viruses with better binding capabilities, they “will be more efficient at finding and infecting one of your cells,” says Nathaniel Landau, a microbiologist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. \nScientists don’t yet know how many particles of SARS-CoV-2 you have to inhale to become infected, but the threshold would likely be lower for a virus that is better at grabbing onto ACE2. \nLandau and his colleagues study binding in the lab by creating pseudoviruses.

Instead, technology investments must be combined with even larger investments in new business processes, skills, and other types of&nbsp;intangible capital before breakthroughs as diverse as the steam engine or computers ultimately boost productivity. For instance, after electricity was introduced to American factories, productivity was stagnant for more than two decades.&nbsp;It was only after managers reinvented their production lines using distributed machinery, a technique made possible by electricity, that productivity surged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three reasons that this time around the productivity J-curve will be bigger and faster than in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is technological: the past decade has delivered an astonishing cluster of technology breakthroughs. The most important ones are in AI: the development of machine learning algorithms combined with large decline in prices for data storage and improvements in computing power has allowed firms to address challenges from vision and speech to prediction and diagnosis. The fast-growing cloud computing market has made these innovations accessible to smaller firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Significant innovations have also happened in biomedical sciences and energy.

(Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nOur optimism is grounded in our research which indicates that most OECD countries are just passing the lowest point in a productivity J-curve. Driven by advances in digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, productivity growth is now headed up.\n\nTechnology alone is rarely enough to create significant benefits.\n\n\n\n\nThe productivity J-curve describes the historical pattern of initially slow productivity growth after a breakthrough technology is introduced, followed years later by a sharp takeoff. Our research and that of others has found that technology alone is rarely enough to create significant benefits. Instead, technology investments must be combined with even larger investments in new business processes, skills, and other types of intangible capital before breakthroughs as diverse as the steam engine or computers ultimately boost productivity. For instance, after electricity was introduced to American factories, productivity was stagnant for more than two decades. It was only after managers reinvented their production lines using distributed machinery, a technique made possible by electricity, that productivity surged.\nThere are three reasons that this time around the productivity J-curve will be bigger and faster than in the past.\nThe first is technological: the past decade has delivered an astonishing cluster of technology breakthroughs. The most important ones are in AI: the development of machine learning algorithms combined with large decline in prices for data storage and improvements in computing power has allowed firms to address challenges from vision and speech to prediction and diagnosis. The fast-growing cloud computing market has made these innovations accessible to smaller firms.   \nSignificant innovations have also happened in biomedical sciences and energy. In drug discovery and development, new technologies have allowed researchers to optimize the design of new drugs and predict the 3D structures of proteins. At the same time, breakthrough vaccine technology using messenger RNA has introduced a revolutionary approach that could lead to effective treatments for many other diseases. Moreover, major innovations have led to the steep decline in the price of solar energy and the sharp increase in its energy conversion efficiency rate with serious implications for the future of the energy sector as well as for the environment.\nThe costs of covid-19 have been tragic, but the pandemic has also compressed a decade’s worth of digital innovation in areas like remote work into less than a year. What’s more, evidence suggests that even after the pandemic, a significant fraction of work will be done remotely, while a new class of high-skill service workers, the digital nomads, is emerging.   \nAs a result, the biggest productivity impact of the pandemic will be realized in the longer-run. Even technology skeptics like Robert Gordon are more optimistic this time. The digitization and reorganization of work has brought us to a turning point in the productivity J-curve.\nThe third reason to be optimistic about productivity has to do with the aggressive fiscal and monetary policy being implemented in the US. The recent covid-19 relief package is likely to reduce the unemployment rate from 5.8% (in May 2021) to the historically low pre-covid levels in the neighborhood of 4%. Running the economy hot with full employment can accelerate the arrival of the productivity boom.

They consistently strive to improve how product management is practiced, ensuring better outcomes over time. In this article, I discuss how individual contributor Product Managers can demonstrate leadership by establishing excellence in product management themselves and across their organization.</p><p>This is Part 3 of the “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@James_Wang-Product/becoming-a-product-leader-introduction-3410931eb7ce\">Becoming a Product Leader</a>” series. In this series, I am tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to become a Product Leader.</p><p>As an IC PM working to become a Product Leader, you need to convince other leaders to trust that you can raise the bar of product management in your organization. This trust is earned through:</p><ul><li>Demonstrating your ability to manage product initiatives of significant scope and complexity, and</li><li>Driving real improvements in product management processes across your organization.</li></ul><h3>Demonstrating Excellence in Product Management</h3><p>Your leadership team relies on Product Leaders to bring a depth of product expertise to the organization. Demonstrating that expertise and earning their trust means:</p><ul><li>Experiencing the product development lifecycle multiple times on initiatives of significant scope and complexity, and</li><li>Effectively communicating with senior leaders and stakeholders</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/1*tZi6nl_Rgx6bh1NMUa2aaw.png\" /></figure><h4>Mastering the Product Development Lifecycle</h4><p>As a Product Leader, you will be responsible for business outcomes across a wide swath of product areas. As an IC, you should aim to understand the Product Development Lifecycle well enough to guide and coach other PMs to success. That means running through the lifecycle multiple times on projects across a range of scope and complexity.</p><p>There are a lot of variations on the definition of the Product Development Lifecycle. But the core principles are the same. Discover and validate what you’re supposed to build and what it looks like. Deliver a high quality experience. Release and market appropriately. Measure impact and gather feedback to determine what to do next.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CVmvEJVijWXM4FVVkODTrQ.png\" /><figcaption>The simple Product Development Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p>The details of each step vary dramatically depending on the scope of the project. For a minor feature improvement, each step can be relatively straightforward. Minimal conversation needed with customers or collaboration with stakeholders. Discovery might be as simple as deciding to build out feature parity across a platform. Definition as simple as modifying designs.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j5QV1rIzxP8TLgxf3tFPVA.png\" /><figcaption>Major feature launches require more validation and collaboration with stakeholders.</figcaption></figure><p>For a major launch, discovery can require in depth conversations with customers and internal experts. Definition requires plenty of concept testing and idea validation. Execution requires phased milestones and coordination with other teams. Go to market is an entire project in and of itself to get all the material together, align stakeholders, and get buy in from leadership.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*F2x2k78kR4ASTXEE6cGH0w.png\" /><figcaption>Large, ambiguous initiatives require consistent validation and approval throughout the lifecycle.</figcaption></figure><p>For really big bets, each step can become its own miniature lifecycle. Discovery and validation become inherent principles behind every step. Approvals from leadership can be required to move forward between steps in order to justify the expenditure of resources or to ensure the brand isn’t damaged or revenue put at risk.</p><p>As a Product Leader, your familiarity with each step across a wide range of scopes is critical to successfully leading a team of PMs. You will be guiding them through new experiences and watching their work to ensure they don’t make irreparable mistakes.</p><p>That said, not every company expects equal depth of experience across the entire lifecycle, nor is the scope of products the same. The key is taking on the widest potential scope a Product Manager can own in your organization.</p><p>I built up a range of experience across my career. Working on a variety of products and business models helped to create depths of skill in areas that I otherwise might not have. Gaming required deep data analysis, down to minutes and even seconds of user behavior. Game launches meant collaborating on creative ad campaigns and hard CPI / LTV optimizations. Growth at Evernote taught me growth loops, clarifying hypotheses, and rapid experimentation.

PMs can get stuck on this step. It’s comfortable, it’s often the only explicit expectation, and there’s always more to be done.</p><p>Additionally, owning too much of the execution process can prevent the team itself from growing and improving. Having to answer every minor UI or requirements question makes you a bottleneck. Being the only person who know how the whole release process works makes you a single point of failure. Driving all improvements from the sprint retro deprives individuals from taking on leadership opportunities.</p><p><a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/becoming-a-product-leader-part-1-thinking-like-a-leader-b38e1d4bccd7\">Your goal should be to enable your team to execute effectively with as little of your involvement as possible</a>. As a Senior Product Manager, you should be able to provide guidance to the team to make them self sufficient. You should know what good and bad execution looks like. You should be familiar with multiple frameworks and methods. You should have developed an understanding of the underlying principles behind those practices.</p><p>This knowledge should make it straightforward to train a less experienced team. You won’t impose your idea of best practices; you’ll work with your team to discover what works best for the team. You know what you can expect, and so you can negotiate and delegate responsibilities. You’ll empower each team member to be responsible for the quality and effectiveness of each part of the process they touch.</p><p>As a result, your team will deliver better product outcomes. Your engineering lead and developers will have more ownership over the process and product. And you will be able to spend more time on the rest of the lifecycle, or increasing the scope of the initiatives you tackle.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zAdDrc19J3wQPSOf7D109g.png\" /></figure><h4>Earning Trust Through Communication</h4><p>It isn’t enough to do the work. You need to be communicating what you do and how you do it, in order to build trust that you can <a href=\"https://jackiebo.medium.com/the-surprising-skills-that-help-you-succeed-in-your-product-management-career-as-you-get-more-3a1fcff40f8e\">autonomously lead initiatives of significant scope and impact</a>.</p><p>A key thing to consider is “autonomy.” Having autonomy means being able to choose goals and the means of achieving them. But having that freedom doesn’t mean being able to work in complete isolation. Great leadership is bringing everyone along the journey, including senior stakeholders and leadership.</p><p>A major facet of communication with leadership is understanding their needs. Your leadership team is looking for confidence. Confidence in the direction you’re heading, the approach you’re taking, the timelines you’ve committed to, and that the right people are being included throughout the process.</p><p>You should be clear in your needs as well. Asking for ongoing resources and support. Help on pushing against or even changing systems that put your projects at risk. And continuous buy-in on direction and approach.</p><p>By addressing their needs and clearly articulating and justifying your own, you will earn their confidence. And you will be demonstrating the degree of scope and complexity you can manage autonomously.</p><p>A mistake I made early in my career was trying to solve problems quietly and only communicate good news and wins whenever possible. I thought that instilling confidence was about never showing weakness. This worked for a while — I solved a lot of problems, had some good wins, and made my way up the career ladder. But as I moved into bigger initiatives, the problems became far beyond what any one team or individual could hope to contain. Trying to quietly manage everything stressed me out, which stressed my team out. And failures became surprises to leadership and stakeholders.</p><p>I started communicating risks early. I walked through the situation, what the team and I were doing to address it, and whether we needed any assistance. Most of the time, nothing changed in what we would do — I was just being transparent about it. And by doing so, it took a lot of the pressure off in the case of failure, and it actually increased confidence that the team and I were doing well.</p><p>I learned that while winning is important, bringing people along the way defines success. By walking with your stakeholders and leaders through each step, they become collaborators in the process. Decisions and outcomes are made together, win or lose.</p><h4>Ideas Into Action</h4><p>When communicating to your senior leaders stakeholders, there are several key areas to cover: conflicts between people, the plans for complex projects, risks to plans, insights on direction, and high impact emergencies. You should seek to provide transparency into challenges and risks, but emphasize that you and your team are taking appropriate actions.</p><p>Examples of the kinds of topics worth communicating:</p><ul><li>Unique insights from customer conversations</li><li>Last minute emergencies that you managed and resolved</li><li>Overcoming logistical hurdles, such as legal blockers or creating an operational plan with customer success</li><li>Disagreements with partner teams on priorities, approaches, or resources and how you plan to resolve them</li><li>Presenting a research plan — goals, hypotheses, methods</li><li>Managing an angry client or frustrated sales rep, or requesting assistance in those conversations</li></ul><p>Look for opportunities to communicate what you and the team have managed. Take advantage of presentations on major launches or research findings. Leverage periodic check-ins with the leadership team. 1:1s with your manager can be an effective time to demonstrate excellence. A good manager can be your strongest advocate. Providing them specific evidence of your good work can be critical to your future opportunities.</p><p>With my reports, I ask them to keep me updated on the many initiatives they’re working on. I ask them to emphasize the challenges they’re facing and how they’re approaching them. For complex projects that are a bit beyond their experience, this ensures I can evaluate their approach and provide feedback. For problems that they are resolving on their own, I have awareness of what they’ve accomplished, and I can then broadcast their successes to other leaders in the organization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qX1JiJ5dl6va-EOVs_zjOg.png\" /></figure><h3>Leveling Up the Product Team</h3><p>Beyond establishing excellence in one’s own abilities, Product Leaders level up the craft of product management across the entire organization.

They consistently strive to improve how product management is practiced, ensuring better outcomes over time. In this article, I discuss how individual contributor Product Managers can demonstrate leadership by establishing excellence in product management themselves and across their organization.\nThis is Part 3 of the “Becoming a Product Leader” series. In this series, I am tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to become a Product Leader.\nAs an IC PM working to become a Product Leader, you need to convince other leaders to trust that you can raise the bar of product management in your organization. This trust is earned through:\n\nDemonstrating your ability to manage product initiatives of significant scope and complexity, and\nDriving real improvements in product management processes across your organization.\n\nDemonstrating Excellence in Product Management\nYour leadership team relies on Product Leaders to bring a depth of product expertise to the organization. Demonstrating that expertise and earning their trust means:\n\nExperiencing the product development lifecycle multiple times on initiatives of significant scope and complexity, and\nEffectively communicating with senior leaders and stakeholders\n\nMastering the Product Development Lifecycle\nAs a Product Leader, you will be responsible for business outcomes across a wide swath of product areas. As an IC, you should aim to understand the Product Development Lifecycle well enough to guide and coach other PMs to success. That means running through the lifecycle multiple times on projects across a range of scope and complexity.\nThere are a lot of variations on the definition of the Product Development Lifecycle. But the core principles are the same. Discover and validate what you’re supposed to build and what it looks like. Deliver a high quality experience. Release and market appropriately. Measure impact and gather feedback to determine what to do next.\nThe simple Product Development Lifecycle\nThe details of each step vary dramatically depending on the scope of the project. For a minor feature improvement, each step can be relatively straightforward. Minimal conversation needed with customers or collaboration with stakeholders. Discovery might be as simple as deciding to build out feature parity across a platform. Definition as simple as modifying designs.\nMajor feature launches require more validation and collaboration with stakeholders.\nFor a major launch, discovery can require in depth conversations with customers and internal experts. Definition requires plenty of concept testing and idea validation. Execution requires phased milestones and coordination with other teams. Go to market is an entire project in and of itself to get all the material together, align stakeholders, and get buy in from leadership.\nLarge, ambiguous initiatives require consistent validation and approval throughout the lifecycle.\nFor really big bets, each step can become its own miniature lifecycle. Discovery and validation become inherent principles behind every step. Approvals from leadership can be required to move forward between steps in order to justify the expenditure of resources or to ensure the brand isn’t damaged or revenue put at risk.\nAs a Product Leader, your familiarity with each step across a wide range of scopes is critical to successfully leading a team of PMs. You will be guiding them through new experiences and watching their work to ensure they don’t make irreparable mistakes.\nThat said, not every company expects equal depth of experience across the entire lifecycle, nor is the scope of products the same. The key is taking on the widest potential scope a Product Manager can own in your organization.\nI built up a range of experience across my career. Working on a variety of products and business models helped to create depths of skill in areas that I otherwise might not have. Gaming required deep data analysis, down to minutes and even seconds of user behavior. Game launches meant collaborating on creative ad campaigns and hard CPI / LTV optimizations. Growth at Evernote taught me growth loops, clarifying hypotheses, and rapid experimentation. Working on zero to one products at both Evernote and Autodesk meant countless hours of user research and validation and complex release plans.\nWhatever your background, seek a range of opportunities to broaden and deepen your own experience.\n\nAvoiding the Execution Trap\nMost Product Managers get their start in the execution step of the product lifecycle. PMs can get stuck on this step. It’s comfortable, it’s often the only explicit expectation, and there’s always more to be done.\nAdditionally, owning too much of the execution process can prevent the team itself from growing and improving. Having to answer every minor UI or requirements question makes you a bottleneck. Being the only person who know how the whole release process works makes you a single point of failure. Driving all improvements from the sprint retro deprives individuals from taking on leadership opportunities.\nYour goal should be to enable your team to execute effectively with as little of your involvement as possible. As a Senior Product Manager, you should be able to provide guidance to the team to make them self sufficient. You should know what good and bad execution looks like. You should be familiar with multiple frameworks and methods. You should have developed an understanding of the underlying principles behind those practices.\nThis knowledge should make it straightforward to train a less experienced team. You won’t impose your idea of best practices; you’ll work with your team to discover what works best for the team. You know what you can expect, and so you can negotiate and delegate responsibilities. You’ll empower each team member to be responsible for the quality and effectiveness of each part of the process they touch.\nAs a result, your team will deliver better product outcomes. Your engineering lead and developers will have more ownership over the process and product. And you will be able to spend more time on the rest of the lifecycle, or increasing the scope of the initiatives you tackle.\n\nEarning Trust Through Communication\nIt isn’t enough to do the work. You need to be communicating what you do and how you do it, in order to build trust that you can autonomously lead initiatives of significant scope and impact.\nA key thing to consider is “autonomy.” Having autonomy means being able to choose goals and the means of achieving them. But having that freedom doesn’t mean being able to work in complete isolation. Great leadership is bringing everyone along the journey, including senior stakeholders and leadership.\nA major facet of communication with leadership is understanding their needs. Your leadership team is looking for confidence. Confidence in the direction you’re heading, the approach you’re taking, the timelines you’ve committed to, and that the right people are being included throughout the process.\nYou should be clear in your needs as well.

I fumbled with my answer that how failure works in business depends on framing. Here’s the answer I wish I’d given her at the time: in some situations failure <em>definitely</em> needs to be avoided and in other situations failure needs to be reframed.</p><p>Failure is a charged topic. Startups and the innovation community berate established companies for not embracing failure. Meanwhile, executives and experienced professionals know that businesses don’t thrive on failure. Failures mean missed results, stress and additional costs. At their worst failures can be career destroying or business destroying.</p><p>Both perspectives — failure is great or necessary versus failure is bad and to be avoided — are useful. You just need to know when the different perspectives apply. This is why the conversation around failure needs to be reframed.</p><p>First, I want to address why failure is bad and needs to be avoided. Then I’ll address why, in the right situations with the right strategy, failure needs to be embraced but it won’t look like failure.</p><p>I’ve chosen this order specifically because I don’t think you can come to embrace failure in the framing I’ll put forward if you haven’t accepted where failure needs to be avoided.</p><h3>Failure is bad and needs to be avoided</h3><p>I’ve been involved in multiple businesses, products and features that failed. It’s not fun. As a founder you can’t buy food if customers aren’t paying you money. As a business, you’re distracted and can’t invest in the future while you’re busy nursing a failure.</p><p>As an individual, success is better than failure. As a business, success is better than failure.</p><p>Before Google Maps I had the great idea of creating a directory of businesses and listing their menus and services. I plugged away at it for a year. We made something like $75.80. Meanwhile the costs of running the business and the time I was putting into it far exceeded the incoming cash.</p><p>At the big end of town, I worked tirelessly with team mates on a process improvement tool that just couldn’t break out. The business funding the tool continued to invest despite the lack of progress, this meant people elsewhere in the business missed pay rises and bonuses. The executive team expended energy on the failing business that could have been invested in another, rapidly growing and profitable portion of the business.</p><p>In another situation, on a smaller scale, a failure by a product team to properly test a financial calculation within the product led to hundreds of thousands in lost revenue. Given this represented a material portion of the businesses overall revenue it wasn’t a great situation.</p><p>Contrast these situations with successful products and initiatives, everyone is happier. The business is more profitable. Customers are happier. People get promotions. Shareholders win.</p><p>Additionally, failure as a result of neglect or required action is less than ideal for a business. If a business misses an outcome because it didn’t take action it could have or neglected something it could have dealt with then you’ve missed out on a success that could have been had. You need to avoid failure that has resulted from poor performance.</p><p>I realise it can be difficult sometimes to distinguish between poor performance and a learning curve. But, one perspective that always needs to be considered in this dilemma is that the outcome (e.g. revenue, cost savings, balance sheet improvement) doesn’t distinguish and that’s the practical reality.</p><h3>Failure is great and necessary</h3><p>Proponents of the perspective that failure is great and necessary draw links between failure, risk taking and innovation. It has strong support. There are even conferences dedicated to celebrating failure.</p><p>You sometimes get the sense that big companies feel peer pressured to play along with this view.</p><p>The proponents of failure being great and necessary have a point. Allowing the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/01/the-hard-truth-about-innovative-cultures\">cultural shift and change in processes</a> to enable risk-taking will drive innovation;</p><blockquote><em>Given that innovation involves the exploration of uncertain and unknown terrain, it is not surprising that a tolerance for failure is an important characteristic of innovative cultures. Some of the most highly touted innovators have had their share of failures. Remember Apple’s MobileMe, Google Glass, and the Amazon Fire Phone?</em></blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/01/the-hard-truth-about-innovative-cultures\"><em>Gary P. Pisano, HBR</em></a></blockquote><p>The issue is that it’s not failure that needs to be embraced. As I’ve outlined above, failure needs to be avoided. We need to reframe the push to embrace failure as a push for embracing a culture, strategy and process that enables calculated bets and experiments.</p><p>When you approach risky situations or opportunities, taking a calculated approach to the risk means you don’t need the language of “embrace failure” any more. You shift to a mindset of learning.

I fumbled with my answer that how failure works in business depends on framing. Here’s the answer I wish I’d given her at the time: in some situations failure definitely needs to be avoided and in other situations failure needs to be reframed.\nFailure is a charged topic. Startups and the innovation community berate established companies for not embracing failure. Meanwhile, executives and experienced professionals know that businesses don’t thrive on failure. Failures mean missed results, stress and additional costs. At their worst failures can be career destroying or business destroying.\nBoth perspectives — failure is great or necessary versus failure is bad and to be avoided — are useful. You just need to know when the different perspectives apply. This is why the conversation around failure needs to be reframed.\nFirst, I want to address why failure is bad and needs to be avoided. Then I’ll address why, in the right situations with the right strategy, failure needs to be embraced but it won’t look like failure.\nI’ve chosen this order specifically because I don’t think you can come to embrace failure in the framing I’ll put forward if you haven’t accepted where failure needs to be avoided.\nFailure is bad and needs to be avoided\nI’ve been involved in multiple businesses, products and features that failed. It’s not fun. As a founder you can’t buy food if customers aren’t paying you money. As a business, you’re distracted and can’t invest in the future while you’re busy nursing a failure.\nAs an individual, success is better than failure. As a business, success is better than failure.\nBefore Google Maps I had the great idea of creating a directory of businesses and listing their menus and services. I plugged away at it for a year. We made something like $75.80. Meanwhile the costs of running the business and the time I was putting into it far exceeded the incoming cash.\nAt the big end of town, I worked tirelessly with team mates on a process improvement tool that just couldn’t break out. The business funding the tool continued to invest despite the lack of progress, this meant people elsewhere in the business missed pay rises and bonuses. The executive team expended energy on the failing business that could have been invested in another, rapidly growing and profitable portion of the business.\nIn another situation, on a smaller scale, a failure by a product team to properly test a financial calculation within the product led to hundreds of thousands in lost revenue. Given this represented a material portion of the businesses overall revenue it wasn’t a great situation.\nContrast these situations with successful products and initiatives, everyone is happier. The business is more profitable. Customers are happier. People get promotions. Shareholders win.\nAdditionally, failure as a result of neglect or required action is less than ideal for a business. If a business misses an outcome because it didn’t take action it could have or neglected something it could have dealt with then you’ve missed out on a success that could have been had. You need to avoid failure that has resulted from poor performance.\nI realise it can be difficult sometimes to distinguish between poor performance and a learning curve. But, one perspective that always needs to be considered in this dilemma is that the outcome (e.g. revenue, cost savings, balance sheet improvement) doesn’t distinguish and that’s the practical reality.\nFailure is great and necessary\nProponents of the perspective that failure is great and necessary draw links between failure, risk taking and innovation. It has strong support. There are even conferences dedicated to celebrating failure.\nYou sometimes get the sense that big companies feel peer pressured to play along with this view.\nThe proponents of failure being great and necessary have a point. Allowing the cultural shift and change in processes to enable risk-taking will drive innovation;\nGiven that innovation involves the exploration of uncertain and unknown terrain, it is not surprising that a tolerance for failure is an important characteristic of innovative cultures. Some of the most highly touted innovators have had their share of failures. Remember Apple’s MobileMe, Google Glass, and the Amazon Fire Phone?\nGary P. Pisano, HBR\nThe issue is that it’s not failure that needs to be embraced. As I’ve outlined above, failure needs to be avoided. We need to reframe the push to embrace failure as a push for embracing a culture, strategy and process that enables calculated bets and experiments.\nWhen you approach risky situations or opportunities, taking a calculated approach to the risk means you don’t need the language of “embrace failure” any more. You shift to a mindset of learning. You shift to a mindset of taking risks that won’t break the bank (emotionally, metaphorically or literally).\nIf you’re looking for an approach and mindset then Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke provides solid foundations to reframe failure from.\nTaking this approach removes the pressure and emotion. People will see what is learnt and what kind of progress can be made instead of counting on the activity resulting in a successful outcome.\nIt also encourages iteration towards a bigger vision. Where small missteps or mistakes along the way are still progress towards the end goal, instead of being real or perceived failures.\nOriginally published at https://terem.tech on June 9, 2021.\n\nHow Do You Think About Failure? was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Scott Middleton","guid":"https://medium.com/p/60016eed1607","categories":["failure","business-strategy","innovation-culture","innovation","business"],"isoDate":"2021-06-10T08:10:22.000Z"},{"creator":"Rakia Ben Sassi","title":"The Little Question I Forgot to Ask Myself to Future-Proof My Work","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/a-question-to-future-proof-your-work-bde6d9546fef?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 04:48:17 GMT","dc:creator":"Rakia Ben Sassi","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/a-question-to-future-proof-your-work-bde6d9546fef?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*AHJa4OUacWceXlxg\" width=\"3999\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">A dig behind the concept of creativity and what makes content a human-created one</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/a-question-to-future-proof-your-work-bde6d9546fef?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\">Continue reading on The Startup »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"A dig behind the concept of creativity and what makes content a human-created one\nContinue reading on The Startup »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/bde6d9546fef","categories":["writing","technology","creativity","artificial-intelligence","future"],"isoDate":"2021-06-10T04:48:17.000Z"},{"creator":"Sara Mohammed","title":"Why Pinterest Is Still an Untapped Gold Mine—And 6 Strategies to Promote Your Blog There","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/why-pinterest-is-still-an-untapped-gold-mine-and-6-strategies-to-promote-your-blog-there-de30503e4250?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 01:46:03 GMT","dc:creator":"Sara Mohammed","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/why-pinterest-is-still-an-untapped-gold-mine-and-6-strategies-to-promote-your-blog-there-de30503e4250?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*s-UFtdU5qk8GkYfEFM0LSw.jpeg\" width=\"6000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">In 2021, Pinterest Marketing is still untapped potential.

Venus is 30% closer to the sun than Earth, which is significant, but not overwhelmingly so. And yet after 4.5 billion years, these two planets have fared very differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there’s mounting evidence that Venus might have been home to water long ago. The Pioneer Venus missions launched in 1978 made some tantalizing measurements of the deuterium-hydrogen ratio in the atmosphere, suggesting Venus had lost a ton of water over time. But we’ve never had a proper mission that could study this history of water on Venus, look for ancient water flow features on the surface, or understand whether it possessed the kind of geological and climatological conditions that are essential for water and for habitable conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There may have been two habitable worlds side by side for an unknown amount of time in our solar system,” says Giada Arney, the deputy principal investigator for DAVINCI+. Although Venus is uninhabitable today, the fact that it may have been habitable at one point means it wasn’t always destined for such a hellish fate if circumstances broke a little more favorably.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s good news for how we evaluate distant exoplanets. “Looking beyond the solar system, this might also suggest habitable planets are more common than we previously anticipated,” says Arney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two leading theories for what happened to Venus—and they both have implications for what we might expect on other exoplanets. The first, consistent with our current-yet-limited observations, is that Venus started off as a hot mess from the get-go and never relented. See, the closer a planet orbits its host star, the more likely it is to rotate slowly (or even tidally locked where one side permanently faces the star, like the moon is around Earth).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slow rotators like Venus generally have a harder time maintaining a global climate that is cool and comfortable—and for a while it was assumed this is probably what drove Venus to become hot and unbearable. The sun’s rays bombarded the planet with heat, and a steam-rich atmosphere never condensed into liquid water on the surface. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur dioxide gases in the air worked as greenhouse gases that only served to trap all that heat. And it stayed that way for 4 billion years, give or take.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s a new theory that’s been recently developed by Michael Way and others at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. That model shows that if you make a few small tweaks in these planets’ climates, they can develop hemisphere-long cloud forms that consistently face against the host star, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab3be8\">reflecting a lot of stellar heat</a>. As a result, a planet like Venus stays temperate and the atmospheric steam condenses into liquid oceans on the surface. Way’s work shows that once you reach this point, the planet can self-regulate its temperature as long as other Earth-like processes like plate tectonics (which helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) can mitigate greenhouse gas buildup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a complicated hypothesis, full of caveats. And if Venus is evidence that slow rotators can develop more habitable conditions, it’s also evidence that these conditions are fragile and potentially fleeting. People who buy into Way’s model think what probably happened on Venus is that a massive amount of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/21/1005507/venus-dozens-active-volcanoes-coronae/\">volcanic activity</a> overwhelmed the planet with carbon and turned the atmosphere 96% carbon dioxide, overriding whatever relief plate tectonics could provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, it’s a hypothesis worth testing through DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, because as Arney points out, many of the potentially habitable exoplanets we’ve discovered are slow rotators that orbit low-mass stars. Because these stars are dimmer, planets must usually orbit them close by in order to receive enough heat to allow for liquid water formation. If they form hemisphere-long clouds, they might be able to preserve habitable climates. The only way we can currently probe whether this hypothesis makes sense is to first see whether it may have happened on Venus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we can apply Way’s model to other exoplanets, we need to determine whether it explains Venus. DAVINCI+ will descend into Venus and directly probe the atmosphere’s chemistry and composition, as well as image the surface on its way down. It should be able to collect the type of data that helps tell us whether Venus really was wet earlier in its life, and also flesh out more of its climate history and whether a hemisphere-long cloud could have really formed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VERITAS orbiter will interrogate the geology of the planet, taking high-resolution imagery through radar observations that might be able to detect evidence of terrain or landforms created by water flows or past tectonics. The most exciting target might be the tessera: heavily deformed highland regions that are thought to be the oldest geologic features on the planet. If VERITAS spots evidence of ancient oceans—or at the very least, of the kind of geological activity that could have kept the planet more temperate long ago— it will support the notion that other slow-rotating exoplanets could achieve the same conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To think about them going together really makes it sort of a complementary mega-mission,” says Lauren Jozwiak, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory who’s working on the VERITAS mission. “This idea that you&#8217;d want to both do geologic mapping and atmospheric probing has been at the heart of how you&#8217;d want to investigate Venus,” says Jozwiak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, if Venus was always uninhabitable, then the reason probably has to do with its proximity to the sun. So any exoplanet of similar size that’s proportionally close to its own star is probably going to be like Venus. And we’d be better off focusing more investigations on exoplanets that are farther out from their stars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if Venus had a period of cool before it turned into a permanent oven, it means we should take “Venus-zone” exoplanets seriously, since they may yet still be habitable.

Some manifestations are:<p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They deal with all impediments personally, although practically any other team member could act, too.</li>\r\n\t<li>Overly protective Scrum Masters filter feedback from stakeholders, particularly any negative feedback. </li>\t\t\r\n\t<li>Often, they do not merely restrict access to the team, but basically shutting it off.</li>\r\n\t<li>They pamper the team by running errands or being the team secretary, sometimes bordering on becoming a concierge.</li>\r\n\t<li>They also prevent the team from failure whenever possible. This even applies if failing would be easily fixable and wouldn’t be really damaging. (Remember: If you’re not failing, you’re not pushing hard enough. Empiricism is based on learning which is inevitably linked to failure.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Overly protective Scrum Masters do not challenge the team. They seem content once a certain level of proficiency is achieved. (What about Kaizen?)</li>\r\n\t<li>Maybe, they are setting boundaries, but they rarely enforcing them. They tend to tolerate damaging behavior from a team member in the (futile) hope the culprit will be insightful and improve over time. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong>: Stop ordering stickies or booking meeting roomy. Instead, relax and let the team evolve, experience problems, and learn how to solve them. Become a true leader. (I still like “become a servant-leader” better…)</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-master-fails-making-your-scrum-work-13/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FuYNTAVFZ35U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When the Scrum Master Fails by Being Overly Protective — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrum thrives when the Scrum teams are self-managing while Scrum Masters embrace their role as servant-leaders. However, “causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress” does not imply solving any issue on behalf of the Scrum Team.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. Scrum thrives when the Scrum teams are self-managing while Scrum Masters embrace their role as servant-leaders. However, this also implies that Scrum Masters fail when they are overly protective.\n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of the overly protective Scrum Master and what you can do about it in less than three minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more us on July 6, 2021, for the Hands-on Agile #32: How to Win with Agile Resistant Teams—Scott Weiner.\n\r\n\r\nThe Scrum Master Job According to the Scrum Guide\n\r\n\r\nThere is a long of list of suggestions on how Scrum Masters serve their Scrum Teams, Product Owners, and their organizations in the Scrum Guide 2020. Let us focus on the Scrum team:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCoaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;\n\r\n\t\nHelping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;\n\r\n\t\nCausing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,\n\r\n\t\nEnsuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n  \r\n\r\nHow Do Scrum Masters Fail by Being Overly Protective?\n\r\n\r\nThe problem: The overly protective Scrum Master is generally shielding the team from the cold and cruel world, creating a safe & happy agile bubble. Some manifestations are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThey deal with all impediments personally, although practically any other team member could act, too.\n\r\n\t\nOverly protective Scrum Masters filter feedback from stakeholders, particularly any negative feedback. \n\t\t\r\n\t\nOften, they do not merely restrict access to the team, but basically shutting it off.\n\r\n\t\nThey pamper the team by running errands or being the team secretary, sometimes bordering on becoming a concierge.\n\r\n\t\nThey also prevent the team from failure whenever possible. This even applies if failing would be easily fixable and wouldn’t be really damaging. (Remember: If you’re not failing, you’re not pushing hard enough. Empiricism is based on learning which is inevitably linked to failure.)\n\r\n\t\nOverly protective Scrum Masters do not challenge the team. They seem content once a certain level of proficiency is achieved. (What about Kaizen?)\n\r\n\t\nMaybe, they are setting boundaries, but they rarely enforcing them. They tend to tolerate damaging behavior from a team member in the (futile) hope the culprit will be insightful and improve over time. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solution: Stop ordering stickies or booking meeting roomy. Instead, relax and let the team evolve, experience problems, and learn how to solve them. Become a true leader. (I still like “become a servant-leader” better…)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Scrum Master Fails by Being Overly Protective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nScrum thrives when the Scrum teams are self-managing while Scrum Masters embrace their role as servant-leaders. However, “causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress” does not imply solving any issue on behalf of the Scrum Team. Moreover, being accountable for the team’s effectiveness does not mean shielding the team from every problem or challenge. Being overly protective is a Scrum Master anti-pattern.\n\r\n\r\nHave you been overly protective in your Scrum Master career?

But a roadmap doesn’t create a clear view of the future. Your vision of the future should bring clarity to your roadmap.</p><p>People usually build roadmaps by throwing a bunch of unrelated projects onto a schedule. That approach works fine until your sales team gets on the phone to tell a customer about the Next Big Thing. They open the roadmap and say with confidence, “9 months from now, on October 15th, we’re going to give you a game changing new feature. It will revolutionize the way you do business!”</p><p>The conversation happens with the best of intentions. IT is trying to help sales understand what they’re doing. Sales is trying to help the customer see the value in your company. The customer gets excited because they’ve been promised a New Thing! The problem is the enormous gap between today and 9 months down the road. That time is full of uncertainty and changing projects.

I’ll say that again to drive home the importance. <strong>Do not share the internal roadmap with customers</strong>! Team members will want to share your roadmap with the best of intentions.

It sets expectations that become unintentional commitments.</li></ul><h3>Target Audience</h3><p>If the roadmap isn’t for customers, who is the intended audience? Start by asking who in your business needs to understand the product’s vision. An internal roadmap is a tool in the Product Owner’s toolbox to enable conversation. Use it to communicate how expected work fits into the goals of the company. Use flexible timelines to guide the expectations of internal stakeholders. Most of all, use it to stop sales driven development from derailing delivery. A roadmap tells business stakeholders that you have a plan.</p><h3>Framework</h3><h4>Step 1 — Vision</h4><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Define a long-term vision statement for the platform.</p><p><strong>Participants: </strong>Senior Leadership (required), Product Manager (required), Product Owner (optional)</p><p><strong>Guiding Question: </strong>What is the purpose of this platform and how does it support company goals?</p><p>Let’s use an existing product launch to illustrate how to apply this framework.

But a roadmap doesn’t create a clear view of the future. Your vision of the future should bring clarity to your roadmap.\nPeople usually build roadmaps by throwing a bunch of unrelated projects onto a schedule. That approach works fine until your sales team gets on the phone to tell a customer about the Next Big Thing. They open the roadmap and say with confidence, “9 months from now, on October 15th, we’re going to give you a game changing new feature. It will revolutionize the way you do business!”\nThe conversation happens with the best of intentions. IT is trying to help sales understand what they’re doing. Sales is trying to help the customer see the value in your company. The customer gets excited because they’ve been promised a New Thing! The problem is the enormous gap between today and 9 months down the road. That time is full of uncertainty and changing projects. When you define a roadmap as a group of project commitments, you’ve set your team up for failure.\nSo why build a roadmap at all?\nA good roadmap illustrates how your product contributes to the company.

I&#8217;m an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Louisville. So, I&#8217;m interested in how children think, and specifically, I&#8217;m interested in how children think about information sources. For example, when they have a question about something, how do they go about figuring out where to find the answer and which answers to trust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> So, when she found her son sitting alone talking to Siri one afternoon&#8230; It sparked her interest right away. She says he was four years old when he started asking it questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Judith:</em> Like, what&#8217;s my name? And it seemed like he was kind of testing her to see what she would say in response. Like, did she actually, you know, know these things about him? The funny part was that the device belonged to my husband, whose name is Nick. And so when he said, what&#8217;s my name? She said, Nick. And he said, no, this is David. So, you know, it was plausible. It wasn&#8217;t even that she just said, I don&#8217;t know, she actually said something, but it was wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> Then&#8230; he started asking questions that <em>weren’t</em> just about himself…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Judith:</em> Which was really interesting because it seemed like he was really trying to figure out, is this device somehow watching me and can it see me right now? And then he moved on to asking what I can only describe as a really broad range of questions. Some of which I recognize as topics that we had talked about. So he asked her, for example, do eagles eat snakes? And I guess he and my husband had been talking about Eagles and snakes recently, but then he also asked her some really kind of profound questions that he hadn&#8217;t really asked us. So at one point he asked why do things die? Which you know is a pretty heavy thing for a four year old to be asking Siri.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>And as this went on&#8230; <em>she started secretly taping him</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>David: </em>How do you get out of Egypt?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is buttface a bad word?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; And why do things die?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Judith: </em>Later on that day after I stopped recording him and he had kind of lost interest in this activity, I asked him a bit more and he told me that he thought there really was a tiny person inside there. That&#8217;s who Siri was. She was a tiny person inside the iPad. And that&#8217;s who was answering his questions. He didn&#8217;t have as good of an insight into where she got her answers from. So he wasn&#8217;t able to say, Oh, they&#8217;re coming from the internet. And that&#8217;s one of the things that I&#8217;ve become very interested in is, well, when kids hear these devices, what, where do they think this information is coming from? Is it a tiny person or is it, you know, something else. And, and that ties into questions of, do you believe it? Right? So, should you trust what the device tells you in response to your question?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> It’s the kind of trust that little kids place in their parents and teachers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Judith:</em> Anecdotally I think parents think like, oh, kids are gullible and they&#8217;ll trust everything they see on the internet. But actually what we&#8217;ve found both with research in the United States and with research with children in China is that young children in preschool ages about four to six are actually very skeptical of the internet and given the choice they’d rather consult a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> But she says that could change as voice activated devices become more and more commonplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Judith:</em> And we&#8217;ve been trying to find out if kids have similar kinds of intuitions about the devices as they do about the internet in general but we are seeing similar patterns with young children where again, young children given the choice are saying, I would rather go ask a person for information at least when they information has to do with facts. Like, you know, where does something live, where, where do these things come from? And most of our research has focused on facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> She does see a shift around 7 or 8 when kids start to trust the internet and voice assistants more. But she wants to be clear &#8211; this is early research&#8230; And it&#8217;s not that kids believe devices a hundred percent of the time as they get older they just believe them <em>more</em> often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why are the youngest kids&#8230; the ones with big imaginations&#8230; more skeptical than older kids?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Judith:</em> Younger kids I think are skeptical frankly, because these are quite strange objects, right? In some ways they&#8217;re like people, right? It talks to you. It kind of has a back and forth conversation. But in other ways, these devices are nothing like a person at all, right? It&#8217;s this strange box. It doesn&#8217;t have a face or eyes or anything like that, that it suggests that it&#8217;s an animate object and it isn&#8217;t, of course, right? So, you know, for young kids, that should actually be quite difficult to figure out, and it makes sense that they might be cautious about it, that they might say, well, yeah, maybe you can do some things, but I&#8217;m going to go with the safe bet is to ask my mom or my teacher over this sort of strange unknown thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> Alexa has more than 80,000 skills In the U.S.… and there’s developer support for skills aimed at kids.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[School bell rings.

Even with all of the softwares out there to [00:18:06] Big brother, their own phones and watch every text message and everything they&#8217;re surfing. <s>I don&#8217;t, </s>it&#8217;s a big question and I don&#8217;t think we have the answer yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tanya:</em> So another reason why these voice games are becoming more popular is that they&#8217;re screen-free, which is really interesting and important. Given the fact that kids are usually recommended not to have more than two hours of screen time per day. And that&#8217;s when they&#8217;re about four or five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi my name is Tanya Basu, I’m a senior reporter at MIT Technology Review and I cover humans and technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Younger kids, especially, should not be exposed to as much screen time. And audio based entertainment often seems healthier to parents because it gives them that ability to be entertained, to be educated, to think about things in a different way that doesn&#8217;t require basically a screen in front of their face and potentially, creating problems later down the road that we just don&#8217;t know about right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>But designing these systems… isn’t without complications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tanya:</em>&nbsp; A lot of it is that kids are learning how to speak, you know, you and I are having this conversation right now, we have an understanding of what a dialogue is in a way that children don&#8217;t. So there&#8217;s obviously that. There&#8217;s also the fact that kids don&#8217;t really sit still. So, you know, one might be far away or screaming or saying a word differently. And that obviously affects the way developers might be creating these games. And one big thing that a lot of people I talked to mentioned was the fact that kids are not a universal audience. And I think a lot of people forget that, especially ones who are developing these games&#8230;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>Still, she says the ability for kids to understand complexity shouldn’t be underestimated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tanya:</em> I&#8217;m honestly surprised that there aren&#8217;t more games for kids. And I&#8217;m surprised mostly that the games that are out there tend to be story kind of games and not, you know, a board game or something that is visually representative. We see with roblox and a lot of the more popular video games that came out during the pandemic, how complex they are, and the fact that kids can handle complex storylines, complex gaming, complex movement. But a lot of these voice games are so simple. And a lot of that is because the technology is just not there. But I am surprised that the imagination in terms of seeing where these games are going is quite limited thus far. So I&#8217;m really curious to see how these games develop over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>We’ll be back, right after this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[MIDROLL]</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa:</em> There&#8217;s always this challenge of throwing technology at kids and just sort of expecting them to adapt. And I think it&#8217;s a two way street.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>Lisa Anthony is an associate professor of computer science at the University of Florida. Her research focuses on developing interactive technologies designed to be used by children.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa:</em> We don&#8217;t necessarily want systems that just prevent growth. You know, we do want children to continue to grow and develop and not necessarily use the AI as a crutch for all of that process, but we do want the AI to maybe help. It could act as a better support along the way. If we consider children&#8217;s developmental needs, expectations and abilities as we design these systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> She works with kids to understand how they behave differently with devices than adults.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa:</em> So, when they touch the touch screen or when they draw on the touch screen, what does that look like from a software point of view that we can then adapt our algorithms to recognize and interpret those interactions more accurately. // So some of the challenges that you see are really understanding kids&#8217; needs, expectations and abilities with respect to technology, and it&#8217;s all going to be driven a lot by their motor skills, the progress of development, you know, their cognitive skills, socio emotional skills, and how they interact with the world is all going to be transitively applied to how they might interact with technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> For example, most kids simply lack the level of dexterity and motor control needed to tap a small button on a touchscreen—despite their small fingers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa:</em> So an adult might put their finger to the touchscreen, draw a square and one smooth stroke, all four sides and lift it up, a kid, especially a young kid, let&#8217;s say five, six years old is going to be, probably, picking up their finger at every corner. Maybe even in the middle of a stroke and then putting it down again to correct themselves and finish. And those types of small variances in how they make that shape can actually have a big impact on whether the system can recognize that shape if that type of data wasn&#8217;t ever used as part of the training process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> Programming this into AI models is critical, because handwriting recognition and intelligent tutoring systems are increasingly turning up in classrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recognition algorithms look for patterns and consistency to identify objects. And kids&#8230;are notoriously inconsistent. If you were to task a child with drawing five squares in a row each one is going to look different to an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The needs of kids are changing as they grow… that means algorithms need to change too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, researchers are looking to incorporate lessons learned from kids shows&#8230; like how children establish social attachments to animated characters that look like people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa: </em>That means they&#8217;re likely to ascribe social expectations to their interactions with that character. They feel warmly towards the character. They feel that the character is going to respond in predictable social ways. And this can be a benefit if your system is ready to handle that, but it can also be a challenge. If your system is not ready to handle that, it comes across as wooden. It comes across as unnatural. The children are going to be turned off by that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>She says her research has also shown kids respond to AI systems that are transparent and can solve problems together with the child .&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa:</em> So kids wanted the system to be able to recognize it didn&#8217;t know the answer to their question, or it didn&#8217;t know enough information to answer your question or completed an interaction and just say, I don&#8217;t know, or tell me, you know, this information that will help me answer. And I think what we were seeing, well, we still tend to see actually is a design trend for AI systems where the AI system tries to gracefully recover from errors or lack of information without quote unquote, bothering the user, right. Without really getting them involved or interrupting them, trying to sort of gracefully exist in the background. Kids were much more tolerant of error and, and wanted to treat it like a collaborative problem, solving, experience&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>Still, she admits there&#8217;s a long road ahead in developing systems with contextual awareness about interacting with children.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa: </em>Often Google home returns sort of like an excerpt from the Google search results and it&#8217;s, it could be anything that comes back, right. And the kids have to then somehow listen to this long and sort of obscure paragraph and then figure out if their answer was ever contained in that paragraph anywhere. And they would have to get their parents&#8217; help to interpret the information and a theme that you see a lot in this type of work and generally kids and technologies, they want to be able to do it themselves. They don&#8217;t really want to have to ask their parents for help because they want to be independent and engaged with the world on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer:</em> But how much we allow AI to play a part in developing that independence… is up to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa: </em>Do we want AI to go in the direction of cars, for example, where for the most part, many of us own a car,have no idea how it works under the hood, how we can fix it, how we can improve it. What are the implications of this design decision or that design decision? Or do we want AI to be something where people&#8230; they&#8217;re really empowered and they have a potential to understand these big differences, these big decisions. So, I think that&#8217;s why for me, kids and AI education is really important because we want to make sure that they feel like this is not just a black box mystery element of technology in their lives, but something that they can really understand, think critically about affect change and perhaps contribute to building as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[CREDITS]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jennifer: </em>This episode was reported and produced by me, Anthony Green and Tanya Basu with Emma Cillekens.

But adapting algorithms to interact with a child isn’t without its complications—as no one child is exactly like another. Most recognition algorithms look for patterns and consistency to successfully identify objects. But kids are notoriously inconsistent. In this episode, we examine the relationship AI has with kids. \n\n\n\n\nWe Meet:\nJudith Danovitch, associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Louisville. \nLisa Anthony, associate professor of computer science at the University of Florida.\nTanya Basu, senior reporter at MIT Technology Review.\n\n\n\n\nCredits:\nThis episode was reported and produced by Jennifer Strong, Anthony Green, and Tanya Basu with Emma Cillekens. We’re edited by Michael Reilly.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer: It wasn’t long ago that playing hopscotch, board games or hosting tea parties with dolls was the norm for kids….\nSome TV here and there… a day at the park… bikes.\nBut… we’ve seen hopscotch turn to TicToc… board games become video games… and dolls at tea parties… do more than just talk back\n[Upsot: Barbie ad “Barbie.. This is my digital makeover.. I insert my own Ipad and open my app .. and the mirror lights up..  I do my eyeshadow lipstick and blush.. How amazing is that?”]\nJennifer: Kids are exposed to devices almost from birth, and often know how to use a touchscreen before they can walk. \nThing is… these systems aren’t really designed for kids.\nSo… what does it mean to invite Alexa to the party? \n[Upsot.. 1’30-1’40 “Hi there and welcome to Amazon storytime. You can choose anything from pirates to princesses. Fancy that!”]\nJennifer: And… What happens when toys are connected to the internet and kids can ask them anything.. and they’ll not only answer back…. but also learn from your kids and collect their data.\nJennifer: I’m Jennifer Strong and this episode, we explore the relationship AI has with kids. \n\n\n\n\nJudith: My name is Judith Danovitch. I’m an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Louisville. So, I’m interested in how children think, and specifically, I’m interested in how children think about information sources. For example, when they have a question about something, how do they go about figuring out where to find the answer and which answers to trust. \nJennifer: So, when she found her son sitting alone talking to Siri one afternoon… It sparked her interest right away. She says he was four years old when he started asking it questions.\nJudith: Like, what’s my name? And it seemed like he was kind of testing her to see what she would say in response. Like, did she actually, you know, know these things about him? The funny part was that the device belonged to my husband, whose name is Nick. And so when he said, what’s my name? She said, Nick. And he said, no, this is David. So, you know, it was plausible. It wasn’t even that she just said, I don’t know, she actually said something, but it was wrong. \nJennifer: Then… he started asking questions that weren’t just about himself…\nJudith: Which was really interesting because it seemed like he was really trying to figure out, is this device somehow watching me and can it see me right now? And then he moved on to asking what I can only describe as a really broad range of questions. Some of which I recognize as topics that we had talked about. So he asked her, for example, do eagles eat snakes? And I guess he and my husband had been talking about Eagles and snakes recently, but then he also asked her some really kind of profound questions that he hadn’t really asked us. So at one point he asked why do things die? Which you know is a pretty heavy thing for a four year old to be asking Siri.  \nJennifer: And as this went on… she started secretly taping him.\nDavid: How do you get out of Egypt? \nIs buttface a bad word?\n… And why do things die?\nJudith: Later on that day after I stopped recording him and he had kind of lost interest in this activity, I asked him a bit more and he told me that he thought there really was a tiny person inside there. That’s who Siri was. She was a tiny person inside the iPad. And that’s who was answering his questions. He didn’t have as good of an insight into where she got her answers from. So he wasn’t able to say, Oh, they’re coming from the internet. And that’s one of the things that I’ve become very interested in is, well, when kids hear these devices, what, where do they think this information is coming from? Is it a tiny person or is it, you know, something else. And, and that ties into questions of, do you believe it? Right? So, should you trust what the device tells you in response to your question?\nJennifer: It’s the kind of trust that little kids place in their parents and teachers.\nJudith: Anecdotally I think parents think like, oh, kids are gullible and they’ll trust everything they see on the internet. But actually what we’ve found both with research in the United States and with research with children in China is that young children in preschool ages about four to six are actually very skeptical of the internet and given the choice they’d rather consult a person.\nJennifer: But she says that could change as voice activated devices become more and more commonplace.\nJudith: And we’ve been trying to find out if kids have similar kinds of intuitions about the devices as they do about the internet in general but we are seeing similar patterns with young children where again, young children given the choice are saying, I would rather go ask a person for information at least when they information has to do with facts. Like, you know, where does something live, where, where do these things come from? And most of our research has focused on facts.  \nJennifer: She does see a shift around 7 or 8 when kids start to trust the internet and voice assistants more. But she wants to be clear – this is early research… And it’s not that kids believe devices a hundred percent of the time as they get older they just believe them more often.  \nBut why are the youngest kids… the ones with big imaginations… more skeptical than older kids? \nJudith: Younger kids I think are skeptical frankly, because these are quite strange objects, right? In some ways they’re like people, right? It talks to you. It kind of has a back and forth conversation. But in other ways, these devices are nothing like a person at all, right? It’s this strange box. It doesn’t have a face or eyes or anything like that, that it suggests that it’s an animate object and it isn’t, of course, right? So, you know, for young kids, that should actually be quite difficult to figure out, and it makes sense that they might be cautious about it, that they might say, well, yeah, maybe you can do some things, but I’m going to go with the safe bet is to ask my mom or my teacher over this sort of strange unknown thing.\nJennifer: Alexa has more than 80,000 skills In the U.S.… and there’s developer support for skills aimed at kids. \n[School bell rings. Sounds of children chattering as mumble under next VO.]\nJennifer: Sesame Street designed one for kids to play hide-and-seek with Elmo… \nElmo: Time to guess where Elmo is hiding!  \nJennifer: Nickelodeon has a way to put them under the sea with Spongebob Squarepants… \n[Spongebob Squarepants theme music]\nJennifer: And then there’s a game called Kids Court. It’s an app developed by Pretzel Labs for parents that let’s Alexa be the judge of their children’s squabbles.\nAlexa: Welcome to kids court where everything unfair is finally brought to justice. All rise for the honorable judge, Lexi. Do you want to settle a case or hear about previous trials?\nChild: Settle a case. \nAlexa: Prosecutor, please tell the court what happened.\nChild: Brianna read my diary! \nAlexa: Kids court was created for cases like this. Is the defendant present or absent?\nChild: present.   \nAlexa: Defendant you’re in trouble. What do you plead? Say guilty if you did it or not guilty if you did. \nBrianna: Not guilty!\n[Music transition ]\nJennifer: There’s a lot of companies offering connected experiences designed for kids. Among them, voice games aimed at parents wary of screen time. One system is called Yoto, but it’s got much more in common with a cassette player than a smart speaker. New content like music or stories can be added to the system via cards that, when inserted into the speaker, trigger a download from Yoto’s servers. \nThere’s not much to it. There’s no voice assistant, no camera, no microphone.. and its pixelated display is really only meant to show the time or a cartoonish image related to what’s playing. \nKate Daniels: The best part about it is it’s just so simple. I mean, our youngest turned two yesterday and he’s known how to use it for the last year. You know? I don’t think it needs to be all fancy.  \nJennifer: Kate and Brian Daniels just made the move from New York City to Boston with their three kids in tow—who are all avid users of Yoto. \nParker Daniels: A song album My dad put on is Hamilton. Um, I really like it. \nJennifer: That’s their 6 year old son Parker. He’s going through a binder filled with cards… which are used to operate the device. \nParker Daniels: Um, and I’m now… I’m looking for the rest and I have like a whole, like book.  \nCharlotte Daniels: And on some cards, there’s lots of songs and some there’s lots of stories, but different chapters. \nJennifer: And that’s his younger sister, Charlotte. \nBrian Daniels: So we’re, we’re also able to, uh, record stories and put them on, uh, custom cards so that the kids can play the stories that I come up with. And they love when I tell them stories, but I’m not always available, you know, working from home and being busy.

Mitchell—who turns 60 this June—tested positive for covid-19 at her job as a pharmacy technician at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. She was sneezing, coughing, and feeling dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hospital management offered her a choice. She could quarantine at a hotel, or she could recover and isolate at home, where her vital signs would be monitored around the clock through a sensor patch worn on her chest. Mitchell chose the patch and went home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two nights later, she woke up in a panic because she could not breathe. She was in the bedroom of her suburban Chicago house, and thought a shower might help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“By the time I got from my bed to the washroom, I was saturated in sweat,” she says. “I had to sit down and catch my breath. I was dizzy. I could barely talk.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is when “the call” happened. Clinicians at the University of Illinois Hospital were using sensors like the one Mitchell was wearing to remotely monitor her and hundreds of other patients and employees who were recovering from covid-19 at home. They saw Mitchell’s situation worsen and called. “I was sitting in the bathroom literally holding on to the sink when my phone rang,” she says. The medics told her she needed to see a doctor right away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>“I was sitting in the bathroom literally holding on to the sink when my phone rang&#8221;</p><cite>Angela Mitchell</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitchell was not sure. She did not want to disturb her family sleeping downstairs, and calling an ambulance seemed too extreme. But in the morning, she got a second call from her doctors, who said: Get to a hospital now or we will call an ambulance for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitchell asked her husband—who’d had covid-19 several months earlier— to drive her to Northwestern Memorial in Chicago, where she was quickly admitted and told that her oxygen levels were dangerously low. She says her condition at home changed so quickly—from very mild symptoms to serious respiratory problems—that she didn’t even realize she was in crisis. But by the time of the second call, she says, “I recognized I [was] in trouble and needed help.”&nbsp; She remained in the hospital for almost a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pilot program that helped Mitchell is a part of a study conducted by the <a href=\"https://hospital.uillinois.edu/about-ui-health\">University of Illinois Health</a> system and digital-medicine startup <a href=\"https://www.physiq.com/\">PhysIQ</a> and funded by the National Institutes of Health. It is one important test of a new way for covid-19 patients to receive care outside hospital settings. Monitoring the progress of people recovering from the disease remains a challenge because their symptoms can turn life-threatening so quickly. Some hospitals and health systems have dramatically scaled up the use of wearables and other mobile health technologies to remotely observe their vital signs around the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Illinois program gives people recovering from covid-19 a take-home kit that includes a pulse oximeter, a disposable Bluetooth-enabled sensor patch, and a paired smartphone. The software takes data from the wearable patch and uses machine learning to develop a profile of each person’s vital signs. The monitoring system alerts clinicians remotely when a patient’s vitals— such as heart rate—shift away from their usual levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, patients recovering from covid might get sent home with a pulse oximeter. PhysIQ’s developers say their system is much more sensitive because it uses AI to understand each patient’s body, and its creators claim it is much more likely to anticipate important changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s an enormous benefit,” says <a href=\"https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments/academic-departments/emergency-medicine/about/directory/tvandenhoek/\">Terry Vanden Hoek</a>, the chief medical officer and head of emergency medicine at University of Illinois Health, which is hosting the pilot. Working with covid cases is hard, he says: “When you work in the emergency department it’s sad to see patients who waited too long to come in for help.&nbsp; They would require intensive care on a ventilator. You couldn’t help but ask, ‘If we could have warned them four days before, could we have prevented all this?’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Angela Mitchell, most of the study participants are African-American. Another large group are Latino. Many are also living with risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, or lung conditions that can <a href=\"https://news.umich.edu/african-americans-those-with-type-2-diabetes-kidney-disease-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-hospitalization/\">complicate covid-19 recovery</a>. Mitchell, for example, has diabetes, hypertension, and asthma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>African-American and Latino communities have been hardest hit by the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/12/1018092/vaccine-signup-chicago-zocdoc-frustrating-as-tech-companies-step-in-deeper-inequalities-harder-to-fix/\">pandemic in Chicago</a> and across the country. Many are essential workers or <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/correction-virus-outbreak-multigenerational-families-story-70648439\">live in high-density, multigenerational housing.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there are 11 people in Mitchell’s house, including her husband, three daughters, and six grandchildren. “I do everything with my family. We even share covid-19 together!” she says with a laugh. Two of her daughters tested positive in March 2020, followed by her husband, before Mitchell herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although African-Americans are only 30% of Chicago’s population, they made up <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-coronavirus-deaths-demographics-lightfoot-20200406-77nlylhiavgjzb2wa4ckivh7mu-story.html\">about 70</a>% of the city’s earliest covid-19 cases. That percentage has declined, but African-Americans recovering from covid-19 still die at rates two to three times those for whites, and vaccination drives have been less successful at reaching this community. The PhysIQ system could help improve survival rates, the study’s researchers say, by sending patients to the ER before it’s too late, just as they did with Mitchell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Lessons from jet engines</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PhysIQ founder Gary Conkright has previous experience with remote monitoring, but not in people. In the mid-1990s, he developed an early artificial-intelligence startup called Smart Signal with the University of Chicago. The company used machine learning to remotely monitor the performance of equipment in jet engines and nuclear power plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our technology is very good at detecting subtle changes that are the earliest predictors of a problem,” says Conkright. “We detected problems in jet engines before GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Rolls-Royce because we developed a personalized model for each engine.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart Signal was acquired by General Electric, but Conkright retained the right to apply the algorithm to the human body.

Mitchell—who turns 60 this June—tested positive for covid-19 at her job as a pharmacy technician at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. She was sneezing, coughing, and feeling dizzy.\nThe hospital management offered her a choice. She could quarantine at a hotel, or she could recover and isolate at home, where her vital signs would be monitored around the clock through a sensor patch worn on her chest. Mitchell chose the patch and went home.\nTwo nights later, she woke up in a panic because she could not breathe. She was in the bedroom of her suburban Chicago house, and thought a shower might help.\n“By the time I got from my bed to the washroom, I was saturated in sweat,” she says. “I had to sit down and catch my breath. I was dizzy. I could barely talk.”\nThat is when “the call” happened. Clinicians at the University of Illinois Hospital were using sensors like the one Mitchell was wearing to remotely monitor her and hundreds of other patients and employees who were recovering from covid-19 at home. They saw Mitchell’s situation worsen and called. “I was sitting in the bathroom literally holding on to the sink when my phone rang,” she says. The medics told her she needed to see a doctor right away. \n\n“I was sitting in the bathroom literally holding on to the sink when my phone rang”\nAngela Mitchell\n\n\n\n\nMitchell was not sure. She did not want to disturb her family sleeping downstairs, and calling an ambulance seemed too extreme. But in the morning, she got a second call from her doctors, who said: Get to a hospital now or we will call an ambulance for you. \nMitchell asked her husband—who’d had covid-19 several months earlier— to drive her to Northwestern Memorial in Chicago, where she was quickly admitted and told that her oxygen levels were dangerously low. She says her condition at home changed so quickly—from very mild symptoms to serious respiratory problems—that she didn’t even realize she was in crisis. But by the time of the second call, she says, “I recognized I [was] in trouble and needed help.”  She remained in the hospital for almost a week.\nThe pilot program that helped Mitchell is a part of a study conducted by the University of Illinois Health system and digital-medicine startup PhysIQ and funded by the National Institutes of Health. It is one important test of a new way for covid-19 patients to receive care outside hospital settings. Monitoring the progress of people recovering from the disease remains a challenge because their symptoms can turn life-threatening so quickly. Some hospitals and health systems have dramatically scaled up the use of wearables and other mobile health technologies to remotely observe their vital signs around the clock.\nThe Illinois program gives people recovering from covid-19 a take-home kit that includes a pulse oximeter, a disposable Bluetooth-enabled sensor patch, and a paired smartphone. The software takes data from the wearable patch and uses machine learning to develop a profile of each person’s vital signs. The monitoring system alerts clinicians remotely when a patient’s vitals— such as heart rate—shift away from their usual levels. \nTypically, patients recovering from covid might get sent home with a pulse oximeter. PhysIQ’s developers say their system is much more sensitive because it uses AI to understand each patient’s body, and its creators claim it is much more likely to anticipate important changes. \n“It’s an enormous benefit,” says Terry Vanden Hoek, the chief medical officer and head of emergency medicine at University of Illinois Health, which is hosting the pilot. Working with covid cases is hard, he says: “When you work in the emergency department it’s sad to see patients who waited too long to come in for help.  They would require intensive care on a ventilator. You couldn’t help but ask, ‘If we could have warned them four days before, could we have prevented all this?’”\nLike Angela Mitchell, most of the study participants are African-American. Another large group are Latino. Many are also living with risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, or lung conditions that can complicate covid-19 recovery. Mitchell, for example, has diabetes, hypertension, and asthma.\nAfrican-American and Latino communities have been hardest hit by the pandemic in Chicago and across the country. Many are essential workers or live in high-density, multigenerational housing.\nFor example, there are 11 people in Mitchell’s house, including her husband, three daughters, and six grandchildren. “I do everything with my family. We even share covid-19 together!” she says with a laugh. Two of her daughters tested positive in March 2020, followed by her husband, before Mitchell herself.\nAlthough African-Americans are only 30% of Chicago’s population, they made up about 70% of the city’s earliest covid-19 cases. That percentage has declined, but African-Americans recovering from covid-19 still die at rates two to three times those for whites, and vaccination drives have been less successful at reaching this community. The PhysIQ system could help improve survival rates, the study’s researchers say, by sending patients to the ER before it’s too late, just as they did with Mitchell.\nLessons from jet engines\nPhysIQ founder Gary Conkright has previous experience with remote monitoring, but not in people. In the mid-1990s, he developed an early artificial-intelligence startup called Smart Signal with the University of Chicago. The company used machine learning to remotely monitor the performance of equipment in jet engines and nuclear power plants.\n“Our technology is very good at detecting subtle changes that are the earliest predictors of a problem,” says Conkright. “We detected problems in jet engines before GE, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce because we developed a personalized model for each engine.”\nSmart Signal was acquired by General Electric, but Conkright retained the right to apply the algorithm to the human body. At that time, his mother was experiencing COPD and was rushed to intensive care several times, he said. The entrepreneur wondered if he could remotely monitor her recovery by adapting his existing AI system. The result: PhysIQ and the algorithms now used to monitor people with heart disease, COPD, and covid-19.\nIts power, Conkright says, lies in its ability to create a unique “baseline” for each patient—a snapshot of that person’s norm—and then detect exceedingly small changes that might cause concern. \nThe algorithms need only about 36 hours to create a profile for each person. \nThe system gets to know “how you are looking in your everyday life,” says Vanden Hoek. “You may be breathing faster, your activity level is falling, or your heart rate is different than the baseline. The advanced practice provider can look at those alerts and decide to call that person to check in. If there are concerns”—such as potential heart or respiratory failure, he says—“they can be referred to a physician or even urgent care or the emergency department.”\nIn the pilot, clinicians monitor the data streams around the clock.

He had worked at the company’s<strong> </strong>warehouse in the southern city of<strong> </strong>Daegu<strong> </strong>for a little over a year, <a href=\"https://imnews.imbc.com/replay/straight/6095647_28993.html\">hauling</a> crates full of items ready to be shipped to delivery hubs. When he didn’t <a href=\"https://imnews.imbc.com/replay/straight/6095647_28993.html\">come</a> out of the bathroom for over an hour and a half, his father opened the door to <a href=\"https://imnews.imbc.com/replay/2020/nwdesk/article/5943308_32524.html\">find him</a> unconscious and curled in a ball in the bathtub, his arms tucked tightly into his chest. He was rushed to the <a href=\"https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1006213781\">hospital</a>, but with no pulse and failing to breathe on his own, doctors pronounced him dead at 9:09 a.m. The coroner ruled that he had died from a heart attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jang’s story caught my eye because he was the third Coupang worker to die that year, adding to growing concern about the nature of the company’s success. And Coupang has been astoundingly successful: it has risen to become South Korea’s <a href=\"https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20201117040100030\">third-largest employer</a> in just a few years, harnessing a vast network of warehouses, 37,000 workers, a fleet of drivers, and a suite of AI-driven tools to take a commanding position in South Korea&#8217;s crowded ecommerce market. Coupang is everywhere in South Korea: <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/\">half</a> of residents have downloaded its app, and its “Rocket Delivery” service—the company claims 99.3% of orders are delivered within 24 hours—has earned it a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/04/13/coupang-south-korea-amazon-bom-kim/?sh=e4f146168b11\">reputation</a> for “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/how-coupang-is-out-amazoning-even-amazon-according-to-goodwater-capital/\">out-Amazoning even Amazon</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coupang’s use of AI to shorten delivery times is especially striking: its proprietary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7bDUYosNRQ\">algorithms</a> calculate everything from the most efficient way to stack packages in delivery trucks, to the precise route and order of deliveries for drivers. In<strong> </strong>warehouses,<strong> </strong>AI anticipates purchases and calculates shipping deadlines for outbound packages. This allows Coupang to promise delivery in less than a day for millions of items, from a 60-cent facemask to a $9,000 camera. Such innovations are why Coupang confidently <a href=\"https://rocketyourcareer.usa.coupang.com/about-us\">bills</a> itself as the <a href=\"https://pando.com/2014/12/10/koreas-coupang-offers-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-mobile-commerce-raises-300m-to-accelerate-growth/\">“future of ecommerce,”</a> and were the driving force behind company’s recent launch on Nasdaq that valued the company at $84 billion—the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/south-korea-s-coupang-seeks-up-to-3-6-billion-in-new-york-ipo\">biggest US IPO</a> by an Asian company since Alibaba in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does all this innovation and efficiency mean for the company’s workers?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1666\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fulfillmentcenter1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025928\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fulfillmentcenter1.jpg 2500w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fulfillmentcenter1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fulfillmentcenter1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fulfillmentcenter1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fulfillmentcenter1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the question I had in mind last summer, before Jang’s death, when I met several of Coupang’s warehouse and delivery workers. Like Jang, who had told his mother that workers were treated like “disposable objects,” they had all experienced the dehumanizing effects of Coupang’s algorithmic innovations. Some talked about a bruising pace of work hitched to the expectations of superhuman delivery times. Others said it was difficult to even go to the bathroom at work. In 2014, when Coupang began offering Rocket Delivery, its on-demand delivery service, it had <a href=\"https://moneys.mt.co.kr/news/mwView.php?no=2016031716138053215\">promised</a> stable careers with above-average benefits even to bottom-rung workers. But somewhere along the way, it seemed, the workers had been reduced to what South Korean labor journalist Kim Ha-young has <a href=\"https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=q8wQEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25&amp;lpg=PT25&amp;dq=%EA%B9%80%ED%95%98%EC%98%81+%ED%8C%94%EB%8B%A4%EB%A6%AC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FfMTaQEdEF&amp;sig=ACfU3U3JSpA-NprPpfLdA-vWGpYUjslTyg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjs_vjugNfvAhUCE4gKHUxXDR0Q6AEwEHoECA8QAw#_blank\">called</a> the “arms and legs of artificial intelligence.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no coincidence that much of this criticism <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks\">mirrored</a> <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/17/1003328/covid-19-could-accelerate-the-robot-takeover-of-human-jobs/\">reports</a> of working conditions at Amazon. Although Coupang was founded in 2010 as a Groupon-like deals platform, it switched to Amazon’s vertically integrated fulfillment model in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/12/10/coupang-raises-300-million-to-fill-amazon-sized-void-in-south-korea/?sh=76af6a475c34\">pledging</a> to become the “Amazon of Korea.” In doing so, it ran into the exact same problems with labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Demanding work, on demand</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Rocket Delivery work is certainty—a promise that Coupang’s algorithms will <a href=\"https://news.joins.com/article/23636595\">determine</a> exactly when a batch of deliveries needs to <a href=\"https://www.bloter.net/newsView/blt202004290008\">leave</a> the warehouse in order to make it to you on time. In the company’s warehouses, these delivery deadlines come approximately <a href=\"https://imnews.imbc.com/replay/straight/6095648_28993.html\">every</a> two hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I realized when I started working there that the sole priority was meeting Rocket Delivery deadlines,” said Go Geon, one former warehouse worker I spoke to. “We were just robots.” Go <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/\">went on medical leave from</a> his job at Coupang in May 2020 after tearing his left hamstring while running to meet a deadline. He has since been let go by the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>During the pandemic, the casualties of the obsession with hyperefficiency stacked up. From 2019 to 2020, work-related injuries and illnesses at Coupang and its warehouses nearly doubled to 982 incidents.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Amazon, Coupang has <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/\">used</a> a “unit-per-hour,” or UPH, metric to measure worker productivity in real time and maintain the grueling pace in its warehouses. Although workers are officially given one hour of rest for every eight-hour shift—the legally mandated minimum break—one driver I met last September told me that most people simply worked through their breaks to stay on schedule. He is no longer with the company. In an emailed statement to MIT Technology Review, a Coupang spokesperson stated that the company no longer tracks UPH at its warehouses. But one current worker I spoke to recently told me that some warehouse managers are still openly monitoring work rate this way. “They rarely use the term ‘UPH’ anymore,” he said. “But they’ll still hector you for being too slow, presumably based on some form of concrete proof.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic, from which Coupang has <a href=\"https://www.chosun.com/opinion/taepyeongro/2021/05/03/TB2DBG56ABCIDEN2NEMOF2HKHU/\">handsomely</a> profited, the casualties of this obsession with hyperefficiency stacked up. From 2019 to 2020, work-related injuries and illnesses at Coupang and its warehouses <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/business/korea-coupang-ipo.html\">nearly doubled</a> to 982 incidents. Since Jang Deok-joon’s fatal heart attack, three more Coupang workers have died from what labor activists <a href=\"http://www.peoplepower21.org/Labor/1771851\">say was</a> overwork (there have been no official rulings on their deaths).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite the concerns these deaths have raised, none of them have caused so much as a blip in Coupang’s operations. On the contrary, the company <a href=\"https://www.labortoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=202040\">seems</a> to thrive on how disposable its labor is.

In the months leading up to his death, he had worked the 7 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift, in addition to <a href=\"https://www.news1.kr/photos/details/?4447417\">frequent overtime</a>, for up to 59 hours over <a href=\"https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1006073382\">seven consecutive days</a>, earning minimum wage (the equivalent of about $7.60 per hour). “He would be completely wiped out after the end of each deadline,” Park said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, as Coupang ramped up its overnight <a href=\"https://www.hankyung.com/economy/article/2019052384641\">delivery service</a> that offered a 7 a.m. delivery guarantee for orders made the previous evening, the number of deadlines during a typical night shift in the Daegu warehouse increased from <a href=\"https://imnews.imbc.com/replay/2020/nwdesk/article/5948452_32524.html\">around three</a> to seven, according to one worker. Meeting them took a physical toll: Athletic and sturdily built, Jang had lost around 30 pounds since starting at Coupang in June 2019, Park said. She added that the rapid weight loss caused him to develop wrinkles on his face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February, the government of South Korea officially <a href=\"http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/labor/982628.html\">attributed</a> Jang’s death to overwork. <a href=\"https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1006213781\">The final report</a> into his death noted that Jang’s body bore the signs of severe muscular breakdown.

And it said its recent investments into warehouse automation “increases efficiency and decreases workload for our workers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Worldwide worries</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this should sound familiar to those who follow Amazon, where the company’s drivers and fulfillment center workers have reported almost the exact same problems that are just now emerging at Coupang. Amazon too has faced criticism for a punishing pace of work that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/10/18/20920717/amazon-shipping-workers-injuries\">leads</a> to high rates of injury, the use of algorithms to surveil and fire workers, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations\">oppressive</a> productivity requirements that treat workers like robots, and a business model that <a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/publication/amazons-disposable-workers-high-injury-turnover-rates-fulfillment-centers-california/\">seems</a> to depend on disposable labor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States, discontent around these conditions fueled a historic unionization drive at Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama earlier this year. Union organizer Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), talked about the “unbearable” pace in the company’s warehouses and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-03-11/in-alabama-amazon-workers-wage-a-historic-battle-to-unionize\">explained</a>: “This is really about the future of work. People are managed by an algorithm. They’re disciplined by an app on their phone. And they’re fired by text message. People have had enough.” In response, Amazon, which has a long <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html\">history</a> of union-busting activities including surveilling and intimidating workers, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/\">launched</a> a large-scale anti-union blitz while denying allegations that its delivery drivers were forced to urinate in bottles. Amazon has since walked back its denial of these reports, but ultimately won the Bessemer vote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders\">letter</a> to Amazon shareholders published shortly after the unionization vote in early April, Jeff Bezos announced that the company would be rolling out a new “job rotation program” to address the issue of high injury rates. The program, wrote Bezos, will use “sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks.” But underlying this scheme is a problematic view of injuries as a mere efficiency problem rather than the warning signs of deeper dysfunction. And at bottom, the plan seems like less of a serious solution for overwork than an extension of the totalizing and performance-obsessed micromanagement that created the problem in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an emailed statement to MIT Technology Review, Amazon spokesperson Max Gleber declined to offer additional details on the program. “Our scanning process is to track inventory movement, not people,” he said. “We know these are physical jobs but we do all that we can to ensure the safety and health of our employees.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4691\" height=\"2973\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/covid193.jpg?w=3000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025927\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/covid193.jpg 4691w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/covid193.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/covid193.jpg?resize=768,487 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/covid193.jpg?resize=1536,973 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/covid193.jpg?resize=2048,1298 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4691px) 100vw, 4691px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">COUPANG, LLC</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The unionization drive may have failed, but it highlighted how current worker protections are unable to contend with the future of work that Appelbaum spoke about. And the same is true in South Korea, where Coupang has managed to navigate the blind spots in South Korean labor law to keep its workers on insecure contracts—and therefore less likely to organize—while subjecting them to ever-intensifying workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first began reporting on Coupang last summer, <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/\">initially as an investigation into the company’s mishandling of a covid-19 outbreak at one of its warehouses</a>, I was struck not only by how similar its labor issues were to Amazon’s, but by how Coupang workers had immediately understood that their fight was against not just a misbehaving local employer, but the very idea of superfast delivery itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coupang has often repeated the same line when faced with criticisms of its labor practices: that the company’s direct employment model allows it to offer better benefits compared to the rest of the industry. But paying a little more for dehumanizing work does not suddenly make it any less dehumanizing, and workers I spoke to said that any such solutions would fall short of meaningful progress. “The source of all these problems are delivery deadlines and Rocket Delivery,” Go Geon, the former warehouse worker, told me. “That is the starting point of everything.” That’s why the Coupang drivers’ union isn’t simply campaigning for incremental improvements to working conditions or wages, but has called for a rollback&nbsp; of the company’s razor-thin delivery guarantees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After he left Coupang, Go founded an advocacy group for the company’s&nbsp; warehouse workers. He told me he’d felt a sense of kinship toward Amazon workers after realizing they were suffering in the same way. “It would be nice to launch some collective action,” he told me. It was just an offhand remark, but it felt like a vital insight: challenging a single, universalized model that is reshaping e-commerce around the world might require some kind of international solidarity among workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>An existential dilemma</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Coupang’s promises to address its own labor issues, the larger economic currents in which it is placed only <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/#_blank\">deepened</a> during the pandemic. Global e-commerce exploded thanks to store closures and social distancing, and the industry is projected to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/#_blank\">record</a> close to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-update-2021\">$5 trillion</a> in sales worldwide by the end of 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its IPO <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021001984/coupang-sx1.htm\">prospectus</a>, Coupang acknowledged its core existential dilemma: pursuing “speed and reliability”—the two pillars of its business model—while controlling its labor costs, which have <a href=\"https://www.mk.co.kr/news/business/view/2020/04/393137/\">grown</a> fourteen-fold between 2014 and 2020. (Meanwhile, the company has yet to turn a profit with Rocket Delivery.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would a more labor rights-minded approach to this balancing act entail? Can fast delivery co-exist with worker welfare? I recently posed these questions to Jang Kwi-yeon, a labor researcher at the Labor Rights Research Institute. When I spoke to her last year, she had compared Coupang’s warehouses to the infamous sweatshops in 1970s South Korea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think the logistics system itself should be overhauled,” she told me. “The right to rest and the health of workers should be set as fixed preconditions, and then the algorithms should then be put to work to calculate how fast deliveries can be made.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chances of an e-commerce company whose entire business hinges on being fast willingly choosing to be slower are of course close to nil. And even if Coupang changed its approach, the promise of near-instant delivery has already replicated the same problem everywhere. To keep up with Coupang, competitors like internet giant <a href=\"http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0924185825&amp;code=11151400&amp;cp=nv\">Naver</a> and department store chain <a href=\"https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/consumer/987974.html\">Shinsegae Group</a> are<strong> </strong>promising ever-faster deliveries that will undoubtedly place an even greater burden on their workers. More than a dozen delivery drivers for other <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54775719\">operators</a> have died on the job in the <a href=\"https://www.donga.com/news/Society/article/all/20210322/106010563/1\">past</a> year. Families and union officials have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54775719\">attributed</a> many of these deaths to overwork, similar to Jang Deok-joon’s case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;The right to rest and the health of workers should be set as fixed preconditions, and then the algorithms should then be put to work to calculate how fast deliveries can be made.&#8221;</p><cite>Jang Kwi-yeon, Labor Rights Research Institute</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the US, more competition for Amazon—Walmart, for example, has started offering same-day delivery—suggests that the same story will play out. These companies have changed expectations and hidden the real costs from consumers, while many workers who are faced with rising unemployment caused by the pandemic can’t afford to seek out a more humane workplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some version of ethical super-fast delivery may exist, attained perhaps with better wages, stricter health protocols, and by hiring a lot more workers. But Coupang’s story—and the stories of its workers—suggests that this may be a fundamentally flawed proposition. In the end, it is hard to see how faster delivery guarantees cannot be paid for without the increasingly punishing and dehumanizing labor of frontline workers. As the former driver told me: “it’s a model in which it’s impossible not to aggressively slash down labor costs.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Max Kim is a freelance journalist, writer, and producer based in Seoul, South Korea.</em></p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Early on the morning of October 12, 2020, 27-year-old Jang Deok-joon came home after working his overnight shift at South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang and jumped into the shower. He had worked at the company’s warehouse in the southern city of Daegu for a little over a year, hauling crates full of items ready to be shipped to delivery hubs. When he didn’t come out of the bathroom for over an hour and a half, his father opened the door to find him unconscious and curled in a ball in the bathtub, his arms tucked tightly into his chest. He was rushed to the hospital, but with no pulse and failing to breathe on his own, doctors pronounced him dead at 9:09 a.m. The coroner ruled that he had died from a heart attack.\nJang’s story caught my eye because he was the third Coupang worker to die that year, adding to growing concern about the nature of the company’s success. And Coupang has been astoundingly successful: it has risen to become South Korea’s third-largest employer in just a few years, harnessing a vast network of warehouses, 37,000 workers, a fleet of drivers, and a suite of AI-driven tools to take a commanding position in South Korea’s crowded ecommerce market. Coupang is everywhere in South Korea: half of residents have downloaded its app, and its “Rocket Delivery” service—the company claims 99.3% of orders are delivered within 24 hours—has earned it a reputation for “out-Amazoning even Amazon.”\nCoupang’s use of AI to shorten delivery times is especially striking: its proprietary algorithms calculate everything from the most efficient way to stack packages in delivery trucks, to the precise route and order of deliveries for drivers. In warehouses, AI anticipates purchases and calculates shipping deadlines for outbound packages. This allows Coupang to promise delivery in less than a day for millions of items, from a 60-cent facemask to a $9,000 camera. Such innovations are why Coupang confidently bills itself as the “future of ecommerce,” and were the driving force behind company’s recent launch on Nasdaq that valued the company at $84 billion—the biggest US IPO by an Asian company since Alibaba in 2014. \nBut what does all this innovation and efficiency mean for the company’s workers?\n\n\n\n\nThat was the question I had in mind last summer, before Jang’s death, when I met several of Coupang’s warehouse and delivery workers. Like Jang, who had told his mother that workers were treated like “disposable objects,” they had all experienced the dehumanizing effects of Coupang’s algorithmic innovations. Some talked about a bruising pace of work hitched to the expectations of superhuman delivery times. Others said it was difficult to even go to the bathroom at work. In 2014, when Coupang began offering Rocket Delivery, its on-demand delivery service, it had promised stable careers with above-average benefits even to bottom-rung workers. But somewhere along the way, it seemed, the workers had been reduced to what South Korean labor journalist Kim Ha-young has called the “arms and legs of artificial intelligence.” \nIt is no coincidence that much of this criticism mirrored reports of working conditions at Amazon. Although Coupang was founded in 2010 as a Groupon-like deals platform, it switched to Amazon’s vertically integrated fulfillment model in 2014, pledging to become the “Amazon of Korea.” In doing so, it ran into the exact same problems with labor.\nDemanding work, on demand\nWhat makes Rocket Delivery work is certainty—a promise that Coupang’s algorithms will determine exactly when a batch of deliveries needs to leave the warehouse in order to make it to you on time. In the company’s warehouses, these delivery deadlines come approximately every two hours. \n“I realized when I started working there that the sole priority was meeting Rocket Delivery deadlines,” said Go Geon, one former warehouse worker I spoke to. “We were just robots.” Go went on medical leave from his job at Coupang in May 2020 after tearing his left hamstring while running to meet a deadline. He has since been let go by the company.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the casualties of the obsession with hyperefficiency stacked up. From 2019 to 2020, work-related injuries and illnesses at Coupang and its warehouses nearly doubled to 982 incidents.\n\n\n\n\nLike Amazon, Coupang has used a “unit-per-hour,” or UPH, metric to measure worker productivity in real time and maintain the grueling pace in its warehouses. Although workers are officially given one hour of rest for every eight-hour shift—the legally mandated minimum break—one driver I met last September told me that most people simply worked through their breaks to stay on schedule. He is no longer with the company. In an emailed statement to MIT Technology Review, a Coupang spokesperson stated that the company no longer tracks UPH at its warehouses. But one current worker I spoke to recently told me that some warehouse managers are still openly monitoring work rate this way. “They rarely use the term ‘UPH’ anymore,” he said. “But they’ll still hector you for being too slow, presumably based on some form of concrete proof.”\nDuring the pandemic, from which Coupang has handsomely profited, the casualties of this obsession with hyperefficiency stacked up. From 2019 to 2020, work-related injuries and illnesses at Coupang and its warehouses nearly doubled to 982 incidents. Since Jang Deok-joon’s fatal heart attack, three more Coupang workers have died from what labor activists say was overwork (there have been no official rulings on their deaths). \nBut despite the concerns these deaths have raised, none of them have caused so much as a blip in Coupang’s operations. On the contrary, the company seems to thrive on how disposable its labor is. Although it employs its workers directly rather than using subcontractors, the majority are reportedly hired on a day-to-day basis the night before via an app called “Coupunch,” or on temporary contracts that usually last a few months. This flexibility allows Coupang to match its labor costs to the ebb and flow of business and keep things lean. \n\nCOUPANG, LLC\nBut the constant threat of being denied employment hangs over workers. For those who voice dissent, report a workplace injury, or fall short of their productivity requirements, Coupang is known to withhold contract extensions, workers told me. \nIn its statement to MIT Technology Review, Coupang said that the company “complies with the Labor Standard Act in every aspect including hiring and termination,” and that “the rate of renewal for the contract worker is more than 90 percent.” However, courts have ruled in the past that the company unfairly fired a worker who submitted a workplace injury claim. \n“They make it very clear as soon as you’re hired that if you cause any kind of problems, you won’t be getting a contract extension,” Jeon Woo-oak, a former warehouse worker, told me.\nJang’s death exemplified how exploitative this arrangement can be.

But he had hoped to stay in the company’s good graces and apply for permanent employment, his mother, Park Mi-sook, told me. In the months leading up to his death, he had worked the 7 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift, in addition to frequent overtime, for up to 59 hours over seven consecutive days, earning minimum wage (the equivalent of about $7.60 per hour). “He would be completely wiped out after the end of each deadline,” Park said. \nIn 2019, as Coupang ramped up its overnight delivery service that offered a 7 a.m. delivery guarantee for orders made the previous evening, the number of deadlines during a typical night shift in the Daegu warehouse increased from around three to seven, according to one worker. Meeting them took a physical toll: Athletic and sturdily built, Jang had lost around 30 pounds since starting at Coupang in June 2019, Park said. She added that the rapid weight loss caused him to develop wrinkles on his face.\nIn February, the government of South Korea officially attributed Jang’s death to overwork. The final report into his death noted that Jang’s body bore the signs of severe muscular breakdown. Coupang issued an apology and promised to improve working conditions, such as expanding employee medical checkups.\nIn its emailed statement, a Coupang spokesperson pointed to the fact that Jang’s death was the only one to be officially ruled work-related in the company’s history. And it said its recent investments into warehouse automation “increases efficiency and decreases workload for our workers.”\nWorldwide worries\nAll of this should sound familiar to those who follow Amazon, where the company’s drivers and fulfillment center workers have reported almost the exact same problems that are just now emerging at Coupang.

These companies have changed expectations and hidden the real costs from consumers, while many workers who are faced with rising unemployment caused by the pandemic can’t afford to seek out a more humane workplace.\nSome version of ethical super-fast delivery may exist, attained perhaps with better wages, stricter health protocols, and by hiring a lot more workers. But Coupang’s story—and the stories of its workers—suggests that this may be a fundamentally flawed proposition. In the end, it is hard to see how faster delivery guarantees cannot be paid for without the increasingly punishing and dehumanizing labor of frontline workers. As the former driver told me: “it’s a model in which it’s impossible not to aggressively slash down labor costs.” \nMax Kim is a freelance journalist, writer, and producer based in Seoul, South Korea.","dc:creator":"Max S.

class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Scrabble\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h3>Be Clear on When to Involve the Stakeholders and Development Teams</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can—and should—make many business-as-usual decisions on your own. Complex and high-impact decisions, however, are best made together with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">development teams</a>. There are two reasons for this: First, you usually require people’s expertise to help you tackle complex issues, for instance, to understand technical risks or the impact on the ability to market and sell the product. Second, you need strong support from the stakeholders and dev team members for high-impact decisions in order to ensure that they are effectively followed through. Involving the individuals in the decision-making process show them that you value their input, and it provides them with the opportunity to influence the decision. This, in turn, makes it more likely that they will support and implement the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practical terms, involve stakeholders and dev teams in decisions that affect the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>—be it that you create the plans or that you make bigger changes to them. Examples of the latter include deciding if you should pivot, address a new market or market segment, retire a product, and if you should replace the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> or change the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/should-product-roadmaps-have-dates/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15171\">dates on a product roadmap</a>. Additionally, include the development team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog decisions</a>, and always choose <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a> together.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bring the Right People Together</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve established that a decision should be made collaboratively, carefully consider who needs to be involved in the decision-making process to ensure that the right decision is made and that it receives the necessary support. Then invite the right people to a collaborative workshop, no matter if it takes place online or onsite. A joint workshop creates transparency; it allows the individuals to understand each other’s perspectives and interests; and it frees you from having to go forth and back between the individual stakeholders and dev teams until an agreeable proposal has finally been found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unsure which stakeholders you should involve, then carry out a stakeholder analysis using, for example, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Strategy-Mapping-Strategic-Success/dp/1849201196/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ackermann and Eden’s power-interest grid</a> shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/power-interest-grid-collab-decisions-1024x613.png\" alt=\"Power-interest grid and collaborative decision-making\" class=\"wp-image-17152\" width=\"443\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/power-interest-grid-collab-decisions-1024x613.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/power-interest-grid-collab-decisions-300x180.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/power-interest-grid-collab-decisions-768x460.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/power-interest-grid-collab-decisions.png 1485w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The grid encourages you to divide the stakeholders into four groups, as I explain in more detail in my article <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">Getting Stakeholder Engagement Right</a>. Once you have done this, focus on the <em>players</em>. These are the individuals whose input you need to make the right decision, who help you progress and offer the product, and who are affected by the product and its <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-for-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10199\">ability to create value</a>. For a revenue-generating product, this might be someone from marketing, sales, support, and finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work with several development teams, ask each team to send one or two representatives to the workshop. I find it useful to have UX design, architecture, programming, and testing skills present to make the right decision. And in a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">scaled environment where you share product ownership</a>, involve the product people who work with you, for example, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">feature owners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use a Dedicated Facilitator</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you bring people together to make a decision, getting the individuals to engage in a constructive conversation can be challenging, as you might have experienced yourself. Some individuals might enjoy sharing their ideas so much that they won’t stop talking. Others might be shy and reluctant to contribute, and senior members might expect that their suggestions are followed by everyone. What&#8217;s more, you are usually required to actively contribute to the decision and share your expertise, as the person in charge of the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I therefore recommend using a dedicated, skilled facilitator who runs the meeting and facilitates the decision-making process. This might be your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a>, assuming that the role is filled, and that the individual has the skills required. The facilitator should establish ground rules, help people embrace a collaborative mindset, create an environment where people feel safe to speak their minds, encourage everyone to fully participate and prevent individuals from dominating, ensure that an appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">decision rule</a> has been chosen, and guide everyone through the decision-making process. Having a dedicated facilitator can be especially useful in an online workshop where people may need more encouragement to fully participate and stay engaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lead by Example</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding together becomes difficult when people act in self-centered ways and aim to maximise their personal gain, seek to dominate the discussion, or believe that they know best and that their idea must win. What’s needed to develop an inclusive solution and reach a sustainable agreement is a collaborative mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I therefore recommend that you lead by example, embrace a collaborative attitude, and show that you value the ideas and perspectives of the stakeholders and team members. The following three practices will help you with this: First, show a genuine interest in the perspectives and needs of all attendees—no matter how senior or junior they might be. Second, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14954\">actively listen</a> to the individuals, give everyone your full attention, and appreciate their contributions even if you disagree. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/growth-mindset-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14188\">keep an open mind</a>. While it is important that you have your own perspective and ideas, hold them lightly. Cultivate a receptive and curious attitude and be open to what the stakeholders and development team members have to say. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that attentive listening and open-mindedness do not imply approval. But they make the other person feel understood and appreciated. What’s more, they are likely to free you from being biased towards your own preconceived ideas and help you take full advantage of the collective wisdom of the group in order to make the best possible decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Decide How to Decide</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that you are asking the stakeholders and development team members at the end of a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15876\">collaborative strategy workshop</a>, “Is everyone OK with changing the needs statement in the product strategy?” Because nobody says anything, you assume that everyone agrees with you. But in reality, people are still thinking about the suggestion. To make things worse, it’s not clear who has the final say on product strategy changes. Is it you, the people present, or possibly the management sponsor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">decision rule</a> avoids these issues. Such a rule clearly states who decides and how you can tell that the decision has been made. There are four common decision rules that facilitate group decisions:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Unanimity</em>: Everyone agrees with the proposed solution and is happy to endorse it.</li><li><em>Consent</em>: Nobody disapproves and has any meaningful objections.</li><li><em>Majority</em> and <em>supermajority</em>: More than half of the people are required to agree with a proposed solution. In the case of supermajority, more support is required, such as two-thirds or 75 per cent.</li><li><em>Product</em> <em>person</em> <em>decides</em> <em>after</em> <em>discussion</em>: Once everybody has been heard and a shared understanding of the different ideas has been established, the person in charge of the product makes the decision.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that each rule has its strengths and weaknesses; none is always appropriate. For example, <em>unanimous agreement </em>generates strong support for important product decisions. Achieving it, however, can take a comparatively long time. Contrast this with the rule, <em>product person decides after discussion</em>, which is much quicker to apply. But it may not generate particularly strong buy-in if your decision does not consider the suggestions of the stakeholders and dev team members.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don’t Rush Important Decisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it can be tempting trying to quickly solve an issue and make a decision, it takes time to leverage the collective wisdom of a group and solve a complex or high-impact issue. The steps described below will help you guide a group through the decision-making process and arrive at a decision that everyone can understand and support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Gather Diverse Perspectives</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that everybody clearly understands the issue to be addressed. Then ask people to share their perspectives, come up with ideas, and voice any concerns they might have, for example, by using structured brainstorming. It is essential that everyone can contribute and is being listened to. This makes people feel valued and involved, and it allows you to collect different ideas and perspectives. Resist the temptation to shortcut the process and to prematurely reach agreement at this step. Otherwise, you are likely to end up with a mediocre solution based on familiar options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Build Shared Understanding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Help people understand each other’s views and encourage them to explore the underlying needs and interests. For example, ask the individuals to explain why an idea is important to them or why they feel strongly about a suggestion. What are their motives or concerns? Give the group the time required to develop a shared understanding, and don’t rush this step. If people don’t understand each other sufficiently, then it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to come up with a solution that everybody can accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Develop an Inclusive Solution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the group has established a shared understanding and people know the reasoning and motivation behind the different suggestions, you are ready to develop an inclusive solution. But this does not mean that you should try to please everyone by cobbling together different ideas, nor does it entail brokering a compromise or agreeing on the smallest common denominator. That&#8217;s the opposite of what a collaborative decision-making process should achieve. A truly inclusive solution addresses the needs of everyone present, move the product in the right direction, and results in a sustainable agreement—a decision that people will follow through.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Data&nbsp;to Make Decisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is very helpful to have relevant experience and a solid understanding of the market, don’t make the mistake to blindly trust your gut feeling or to follow the opinion of the most senior stakeholder. Use data instead to make the decision. If you lack the relevant empirical evidence, consider pausing the decision-making process and collecting the data required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that you are thinking of addressing a new market segment and you are discussing the idea in a collaborative strategy workshop. Some of the attendees, including yourself, have experience in offering products to this segment and are in favour of developing a new product variant for this target group. But if you haven’t done any specific product discovery work and lack data to support this view, I recommend pausing the decision-making process and carrying out the necessary discovery work, for example, interviewing prospective users, and building a throw-away prototype to test your idea. Otherwise, you’ll risk deciding based on experience and beliefs—which may or may not result in the right course of action.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Secure As Much Buy-in As Possible but Do Not Allow Stakeholders to Dictate Decisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When involving stakeholders and development teams in a decision, it’s natural to try to generate as much buy-in as possible. While I can’t emphasise enough how important it is to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14954\">attentively listen to the individuals</a> and appreciate their perspectives, ideas, and concerns, you should not make the mistake of trying to please people or to allow individuals to dominate the decision-making process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, search for a decision that maximises the value your product creates and at the same time, is inclusive and attracts as much support as possible. But do not agree to a weak compromise. Deciding together does not mean that everybody gets their way or is necessarily super happy with every decision. It means leveraging people’s expertise, ideas, and concerns, creating a shared understanding, and finding an appropriate solution that attracts as much support as possible.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-deciding-with-stakeholders-and-dev-teams/\">Making Effective Product Decisions: Tips for Deciding with Stakeholders and Dev Teams</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Be Clear on When to Involve the Stakeholders and Development Teams\nYou can—and should—make many business-as-usual decisions on your own.

The steps described below will help you guide a group through the decision-making process and arrive at a decision that everyone can understand and support. \nStep 1: Gather Diverse Perspectives\nMake sure that everybody clearly understands the issue to be addressed. Then ask people to share their perspectives, come up with ideas, and voice any concerns they might have, for example, by using structured brainstorming. It is essential that everyone can contribute and is being listened to. This makes people feel valued and involved, and it allows you to collect different ideas and perspectives. Resist the temptation to shortcut the process and to prematurely reach agreement at this step. Otherwise, you are likely to end up with a mediocre solution based on familiar options. \nStep 2: Build Shared Understanding\nHelp people understand each other’s views and encourage them to explore the underlying needs and interests. For example, ask the individuals to explain why an idea is important to them or why they feel strongly about a suggestion. What are their motives or concerns? Give the group the time required to develop a shared understanding, and don’t rush this step. If people don’t understand each other sufficiently, then it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to come up with a solution that everybody can accept.\nStep 3: Develop an Inclusive Solution\nOnce the group has established a shared understanding and people know the reasoning and motivation behind the different suggestions, you are ready to develop an inclusive solution. But this does not mean that you should try to please everyone by cobbling together different ideas, nor does it entail brokering a compromise or agreeing on the smallest common denominator. That’s the opposite of what a collaborative decision-making process should achieve. A truly inclusive solution addresses the needs of everyone present, move the product in the right direction, and results in a sustainable agreement—a decision that people will follow through.\nUse Data to Make Decisions\nWhile it is very helpful to have relevant experience and a solid understanding of the market, don’t make the mistake to blindly trust your gut feeling or to follow the opinion of the most senior stakeholder. Use data instead to make the decision. If you lack the relevant empirical evidence, consider pausing the decision-making process and collecting the data required. \nSay that you are thinking of addressing a new market segment and you are discussing the idea in a collaborative strategy workshop. Some of the attendees, including yourself, have experience in offering products to this segment and are in favour of developing a new product variant for this target group. But if you haven’t done any specific product discovery work and lack data to support this view, I recommend pausing the decision-making process and carrying out the necessary discovery work, for example, interviewing prospective users, and building a throw-away prototype to test your idea. Otherwise, you’ll risk deciding based on experience and beliefs—which may or may not result in the right course of action.\nSecure As Much Buy-in As Possible but Do Not Allow Stakeholders to Dictate Decisions\nWhen involving stakeholders and development teams in a decision, it’s natural to try to generate as much buy-in as possible. While I can’t emphasise enough how important it is to attentively listen to the individuals and appreciate their perspectives, ideas, and concerns, you should not make the mistake of trying to please people or to allow individuals to dominate the decision-making process. \nInstead, search for a decision that maximises the value your product creates and at the same time, is inclusive and attracts as much support as possible. But do not agree to a weak compromise. Deciding together does not mean that everybody gets their way or is necessarily super happy with every decision. It means leveraging people’s expertise, ideas, and concerns, creating a shared understanding, and finding an appropriate solution that attracts as much support as possible.\nThe post Making Effective Product Decisions: Tips for Deciding with Stakeholders and Dev Teams appeared first on Roman Pichler.","dc:creator":"Roman Pichler","comments":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-deciding-with-stakeholders-and-dev-teams/#respond","content":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-deciding-with-stakeholders-and-dev-teams/\" title=\"Making Effective Product Decisions: Tips for Deciding with Stakeholders and Dev Teams\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/brett-jordan-TMj1c5wlO3k-unsplash-e1620902875766-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Scrabble\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a><p>I am a big fan of making decisions collaboratively, as it leverages the expertise of the stakeholders and dev teams; it creates a shared understanding; and it generates stronger buy-in.

So far about 63% of US adults have gotten at least one covid-19 shot, and President Joe Biden has set a goal of increasing that to 70% by July 4. But many people in hard-hit communities still haven’t received effective communication about vaccines, and they may continue to face practical barriers to getting shots. As a result, their communities are still more severely affected. In Washington, DC, for example, the racial gap in covid-19 cases <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-coronavirus-blacks-vaccine/2021/05/25/1b6208da-bd6d-11eb-9c90-731aff7d9a0d_story.html\">has grown</a> rather than shrunk since vaccines became widely available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans to increase equity have varied from place to place, with mixed results. Mississippi, which is home to a larger percentage of Black people than any other US state and initially saw stark vaccination disparities along racial lines, has almost <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2021/04/06/how-black-community-leaders-put-mississippi-on-the-path-to-vaccine-equity/\">reached parity</a>. That success has been largely due to church leaders’ role in encouraging people to get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In California, however, special sign-up codes meant for Black and Latino communities <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-22/vaccine-access-codes-for-hard-hit-communities-of-color-circulate-widely-in-affluent-l-a\">were misused</a> by wealthier people working from home, who shared the codes among their social and professional networks, according to the Los Angeles Times. And in Chicago, community members say, a digital divide and other access issues <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/05/03/black-chicagoans-arent-getting-vaccinated-at-the-same-rate-as-others-and-its-more-than-just-distrust/\">left vulnerable populations out</a>—despite a neighborhood-level equity plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are there lessons to be learned?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Equity = accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Achieving equity is often a question of accessibility, says Emily Brunson, associate professor of anthropology at Texas State University and principal researcher of the <a href=\"https://www.communivax.org/\">CommuniVax</a> project. Many things can be hurdles to getting a shot, including inconveniently located vaccination sites with limited hours, the need for transportation to those sites, and the difficulty of taking time off work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>“The problem right now is that it’s being talked about so much as a choice,” says Brunson, who points out that white Republican-voting men are particularly reluctant to get vaccinated relative to the rest of the US population. “Focusing on things that are choices takes away the spotlight from really severe access issues in the US.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One success story took place in Philadelphia, thanks to an effective collaboration between two health systems and Black community leaders. Recognizing that the largely online signup process was hard for older people or those without internet access, Penn Medicine and Mercy Catholic Medical Center <a href=\"https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.21.0094\">created</a> a text-message-based signup system as well as a 24/7 interactive voice recording option that could be used from a land line, with doctors answering patients’ questions before appointments. Working with community leaders, the program held its first clinic at a church and vaccinated 550 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve worked really closely with community leaders, and every clinic since has evolved in terms of design,” says Lauren Hahn, innovation manager at the Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By including community members early on, Hahn hoped, the program would give the people coming in for their shot the feeling that the clinic was made for them. And after their appointment, patients were sent home with resources like the number for a help line they could call if they had any questions about side effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We want to make sure that we’re not just coming in and offering this service and then walking away,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Data needs to guide practice</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers say that having complete data on who is—and isn’t—getting vaccinated can improve the vaccine rollout and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/four-months-vaccination-rollout-ethnicity-racial-data-collection-continues-lag-n1265527\">prevent problems from being obscured</a>. Data gaps have been a problem since the early days of the pandemic, when few states were reporting cases and deaths by race. Though Joe Biden has emphasized equitable vaccine distribution as a priority, the CDC reports having race and ethnicity data for only 56.7% of vaccinated people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone wants more information to be made public, however. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee County executive David Crowley says there can be resistance to collecting and publishing data that shows disparate health outcomes among racial groups. “We have to say that racism has been a problem,” Crowley says. But, he adds, “Look at the data. It’s going to tell you a story right there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His county created a <a href=\"https://county.milwaukee.gov/EN/COVID-19\">covid-19 dashboard</a> that reported detailed racial data before many other jurisdictions in the state, Crowley says. It allowed the county to work with the city of Milwaukee to open special walk-in sites for residents in certain zip codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We haven’t found the silver bullet in all of this,” Crowley says. “But at the end of the day, we know that data is telling a story, and we have to utilize this data.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>“Covid is what really catalyzed this type of analysis work.”</p><cite>Dan Pojar, Milwaukee County EMS</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the data is public, other pandemic response teams outside of government could use it too. Benjamin Weston, director of medical services at the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management, says making covid-19 data transparent and accessible helped community groups and academic researchers know where to focus their efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dashboard has also helped them see, in stark terms, that the communities hit hardest by covid have historically faced broader health challenges. After seeing that covid rates were high in places where people typically have cardiac issues, for example, the county decided to offer CPR training at covid vaccination sites. EMS division director Dan Pojar says he expects about 10,000 people to get CPR training that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That’s an opportunity for us to work with other health systems to flow education and different initiatives into these communities,” Pojar says. “Covid is what really catalyzed this type of analysis work.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>It might get harder from here, not easier</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Public health and equity researchers were not surprised at the pandemic’s disparate effect on certain communities, according to Stephanie McClure, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Alabama. Health disparities along racial and economic lines have the potential to become a national and local focal point—in April, CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/08/985524494/cdc-director-declares-racism-a-serious-public-health-threat\">declared</a> racism “a serious public health threat”—but that tide hasn’t yet turned, McClure says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritizing equity could become more difficult as the US vaccine rollout shifts to a new phase. Some states have asked the federal government to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/states-scale-back-vaccine-orders-interest-shots-wanes-n1266776\">send them fewer vaccines</a> as sign-ups plummet. Some are also closing mass vaccination sites or consolidating efforts. McClure, who leads the Alabama team of the CommuniVax project, says that although it makes sense to respond to changes in the pandemic, those adjustments need to be thoughtful and measured—especially in regions like the South, where a smaller portion of the population is vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McClure says people may think that sites are being taken away because residents didn’t show up fast enough, which can feel like a punishment. “Nobody wants to be told that they’re bad,” she says. “Or it can also be interpreted as ‘We’re taking this back because [vaccinations are] over, or because it’s not really that serious, or because you have enough people who are vaccinated,’ none of which is true.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Persistence is vital</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>McClure says it’s important for public health officials to follow through on their promise to work to get everyone vaccinated. That means keeping in touch with hesitant communities to know if there’s a surge in interest so that vaccinators can quickly meet the demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>“It’s the old public health trick: you make it easy for people to say yes.&#8221;</p><cite>Stephanie McClure, University of Alabama</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s the old public health trick: you make it easy for people to say yes,” she says. “You continue the surveillance and monitoring and get the best data you can on vaccination, and then you plan in cooperation with the community.

That “Agile” is not the quick fix for everything that is going wrong. Each organization has its own set of dysfunctions, and hence solutions dealing with them need to be tailored specifically to that organization. However, there are several essential agile failure patterns common in many organizations, three of which I like to introduce in 7:31 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>  \r\n\r\n<h3>1. Is Agile a Fad or a Trend?</h3> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Parts of the leadership—particularly the middle management—pay lip service at best to the idea of becoming an agile organization. Besides business cards, the business analysts are now Product Owners, not much has changed, except for the inevitable “agile playbook” created by a well-reputed consultancy that the lower ranks are asked to “roll out.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Consequences</strong>: Remember that probably about 10 % of the member of a social group are change agents, 5-10% are refuseniks pushing back, and 80 % typically comprise the silent majority joining when the dices have fallen. With a lot at stake for management folks, why not wait and see? Maybe, it goes away in a few months? </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Leadership is about being the first to explore unknown territory at personal risk, thus being a role model. This wait-and-see approach of the leadership will “earn” support from significant parts of the organization: If the leader is not entirely in, why should I be? And now, everything is either stalling or done by half-hearted measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong>: Awaken the Alexander the Great in you and be a leader. Show support for the massive task at hand by being present and support the effort in every way possible, for example, by: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Communicating the goals time and again by authoring a blog, a newsletter, creating a podcast,</li>\t\r\n\t<li>Practicing Gemba walks,</li>\r\n\t<li>Attending events, meetups, and communities of practice makes everyone understand that Agile is here to stay. (The Sprint Review is an excellent opportunity, for example.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Pointing at successes &#038; failures, establishing a failure culture, see below,</li>\r\n\t<li>Empower the teams to solve customer problems autonomously by defining guide-lines,</li>\r\n\t<li>Include team members in the hiring process,</li>\r\n\t<li>Initiate the abandonment of individual incentives and bonuses.</li>\r\n</ul><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/agile-failure-pattern-making-your-scrum-work-12/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FxRUCPvZYTds%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2. My Budget, My Feature</h3> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: The organization nominally adapts agile practices but sticks with the old ways of figuring out what is worth building:<p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Pitch an idea to the management,</li>\r\n\t<li>Get a budget,</li>\r\n\t<li>Treat the product people as an internal agency to deliver what you want.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Consequences</strong>: Think “Agile PMO,” metered funding, contract negotiations, and servant-leadership by status reports. (Concerning the Manifesto of Agile Software Development, we are back to square one.) Typically, this results in misalignment of efforts at an organizational level and stimulates local optimization initiatives within functional silos.</p> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong>: Break up functional silos, consider practices like Beyond Budgeting, create empowered product teams tasked with autonomously solving customer problems, and link bonuses strictly to the organization&#8217;s overall progress during the agile transformation.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/agile-failure-pattern-making-your-scrum-work-12/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZ9hXZFORZEU%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3. There Is no Failure Culture</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/agile-failure-pattern-making-your-scrum-work-12/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Essential Agile Failure Patterns — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Shouldn’t it be a low-brainer that solving complex adaptive problems of the 21st century does not work by applying methods from the 1890ies? Apparently, it is not. The Manifesto for Agile Software Development has been instrumental in addressing the systemic issues resulting from clinging to Taylorism that numerous organizations still face today. Nevertheless, the overall progress among organizations has been mediocre at best. It is time to change gears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is your organization progressing on its path to becoming a learning and agile organization?

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. When Scrum becomes an element of an agile transformation, the following three common essential agile failure patterns prove to be an exceptionally tough nut to crack for any Scrum Master. \n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of foreseeable failure patterns and what you can do about them in a little more than seven minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more us on July 6, 2021, for the Hands-on Agile #32: How to Win with Agile Resistant Teams—Scott Weiner.\n\r\n\r\nReasons for Becoming a Learning Organization\n\r\n\r\nThere are various excellent reasons to become agile, for example, by adopting Scrum: \r\n\r\n\t\nThe competition drives innovation at an even higher pace, and the organization starts lagging,\n\r\n\t\nThe organization faces problems hiring senior people in an increasingly competitive war for talent, \n\r\n\t\nThe overall productivity is low, \n\r\n\t\nThe organization is losing skilled members, which adds to low morale,\n\r\n\t\nThere are budget constraints: there are no more funds to waste on waterfall projects.\n\r\n\r\nBut the fact is also, that the scope of an agile transformation is often wholly underestimated. That “Agile” is not the quick fix for everything that is going wrong. Each organization has its own set of dysfunctions, and hence solutions dealing with them need to be tailored specifically to that organization. However, there are several essential agile failure patterns common in many organizations, three of which I like to introduce in 7:31 minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n  \r\n\r\n1. Is Agile a Fad or a Trend?\n \r\n\r\nThe Problem: Parts of the leadership—particularly the middle management—pay lip service at best to the idea of becoming an agile organization. Besides business cards, the business analysts are now Product Owners, not much has changed, except for the inevitable “agile playbook” created by a well-reputed consultancy that the lower ranks are asked to “roll out.” \n\r\n\r\nThe Consequences: Remember that probably about 10 % of the member of a social group are change agents, 5-10% are refuseniks pushing back, and 80 % typically comprise the silent majority joining when the dices have fallen. With a lot at stake for management folks, why not wait and see? Maybe, it goes away in a few months? \n \r\n\r\nLeadership is about being the first to explore unknown territory at personal risk, thus being a role model. This wait-and-see approach of the leadership will “earn” support from significant parts of the organization: If the leader is not entirely in, why should I be? And now, everything is either stalling or done by half-hearted measures.\n\r\n\r\nThe Solution: Awaken the Alexander the Great in you and be a leader. Show support for the massive task at hand by being present and support the effort in every way possible, for example, by: \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nCommunicating the goals time and again by authoring a blog, a newsletter, creating a podcast,\n\t\r\n\t\nPracticing Gemba walks,\n\r\n\t\nAttending events, meetups, and communities of practice makes everyone understand that Agile is here to stay. (The Sprint Review is an excellent opportunity, for example.)\n\r\n\t\nPointing at successes & failures, establishing a failure culture, see below,\n\r\n\t\nEmpower the teams to solve customer problems autonomously by defining guide-lines,\n\r\n\t\nInclude team members in the hiring process,\n\r\n\t\nInitiate the abandonment of individual incentives and bonuses.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. My Budget, My Feature\n \r\n\r\nThe Problem: The organization nominally adapts agile practices but sticks with the old ways of figuring out what is worth building:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nPitch an idea to the management,\n\r\n\t\nGet a budget,\n\r\n\t\nTreat the product people as an internal agency to deliver what you want.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consequences: Think “Agile PMO,” metered funding, contract negotiations, and servant-leadership by status reports. (Concerning the Manifesto of Agile Software Development, we are back to square one.) Typically, this results in misalignment of efforts at an organizational level and stimulates local optimization initiatives within functional silos.\n \r\n\r\nThe Solution: Break up functional silos, consider practices like Beyond Budgeting, create empowered product teams tasked with autonomously solving customer problems, and link bonuses strictly to the organization’s overall progress during the agile transformation.\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. There Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEssential Agile Failure Patterns — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nShouldn’t it be a low-brainer that solving complex adaptive problems of the 21st century does not work by applying methods from the 1890ies? Apparently, it is not. The Manifesto for Agile Software Development has been instrumental in addressing the systemic issues resulting from clinging to Taylorism that numerous organizations still face today. Nevertheless, the overall progress among organizations has been mediocre at best. It is time to change gears.\n\r\n\r\nHow is your organization progressing on its path to becoming a learning and agile organization?

Facebook had hoped that the board would decide how to handle Trump’s account, but while it upheld the company’s initial decision to ban Trump from the platform for inciting violence on January 6, it punted the long-term decision back to executives in Palo Alto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news that Trump would be banned from Facebook for another 19 months was meant to provide some answers on the platform’s relationship with the former president—but instead it leaves many open questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Who is this decision supposed to please?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the announcement provides some actual rules about how politicians can use Facebook—and some guidance on how those rules will be enforced—the decision to ban Trump for at least two years isn’t going to be its most popular one. Advocacy groups like Ultraviolet and Media Matters, which have long pushed Facebook to ban Trump, released statements saying that anything less than a permanent ban is inadequate. Meanwhile, the people who feel any rule enforcement against conservative politicians is<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/28/1002376/trump-twitter-conservative-bias/\"> proof that Facebook penalizes conservative content</a> continue to feel that way, despite lots of evidence that, if anything, the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-arbiter-truth-fact-check-mark-zuckerberg\">opposite is true. </a> And it leaves open the possibility that Trump will be Back Online in time for the 2024 election cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What does “newsworthiness” mean now?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many platforms, including Facebook, have used a “newsworthiness” exception to avoid enforcing their own rules against politicians and world leaders. Facebook’s announcement comes with some changes to how it’ll use that loophole in the future. First, Facebook said, it will publish a notice whenever it applies the rule to an account. And second, it “will not treat content posted by politicians any differently from content posted by anyone else” when applying the rule, which basically means determining whether the public interest in a rule-breaking piece of content outweighs the potential harm of keeping it online. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook formally introduced this policy in late 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/09/abusing-your-power-mark-zuckerberg-slammed-after-facebook-censors-vietnam-war-photo/\">after censoring </a>an iconic photo from the Vietnam War because it contained nudity. However, the newsworthiness exception <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/\">evolved into</a> a blanket exception for politicians, including Trump, which allowed rule-breaking content to stay online because it was considered in the public interest by default. But while this announcement appears to end that blanket protection, it doesn’t get rid of it completely, and it does not address in any more detail how Facebook will determine whether something falls under the exception. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Who made this decision?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement was authored by Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president of global affairs, but refers throughout to “we.” However, it does not specify who at Facebook was involved in the decision-making process—which is important for transparency and credibility, given the controversial nature of the decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We know today’s decision will be criticized by many people on opposing sides of the political divide—but our job is to make a decision in as proportionate, fair, and transparent a way as possible,” Clegg wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Where will Facebook get advice?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement also says that the company will look to “experts” to “assess whether the risk to public safety has receded,” without specifying which experts these will be, what expertise they will bring, or how Facebook (or, again, who at Facebook) will have decision-making authority based on their insights. The Oversight Board, which was intended partly as a way of outsourcing controversial decisions, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/05/1024595/trump-facebook-ban-oversight-board/\">has already signaled</a> that it does not wish to perform that role.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This means that knowing whose voice will matter to Facebook, and who will have authority to act on the advice, is especially important—particularly given the high stakes.

Facebook had hoped that the board would decide how to handle Trump’s account, but while it upheld the company’s initial decision to ban Trump from the platform for inciting violence on January 6, it punted the long-term decision back to executives in Palo Alto.\nThe news that Trump would be banned from Facebook for another 19 months was meant to provide some answers on the platform’s relationship with the former president—but instead it leaves many open questions.\nWho is this decision supposed to please?\nAlthough the announcement provides some actual rules about how politicians can use Facebook—and some guidance on how those rules will be enforced—the decision to ban Trump for at least two years isn’t going to be its most popular one. Advocacy groups like Ultraviolet and Media Matters, which have long pushed Facebook to ban Trump, released statements saying that anything less than a permanent ban is inadequate. Meanwhile, the people who feel any rule enforcement against conservative politicians is proof that Facebook penalizes conservative content continue to feel that way, despite lots of evidence that, if anything, the opposite is true.  And it leaves open the possibility that Trump will be Back Online in time for the 2024 election cycle. \nWhat does “newsworthiness” mean now?\nMany platforms, including Facebook, have used a “newsworthiness” exception to avoid enforcing their own rules against politicians and world leaders. Facebook’s announcement comes with some changes to how it’ll use that loophole in the future. First, Facebook said, it will publish a notice whenever it applies the rule to an account. And second, it “will not treat content posted by politicians any differently from content posted by anyone else” when applying the rule, which basically means determining whether the public interest in a rule-breaking piece of content outweighs the potential harm of keeping it online. \nFacebook formally introduced this policy in late 2016, after censoring an iconic photo from the Vietnam War because it contained nudity. However, the newsworthiness exception evolved into a blanket exception for politicians, including Trump, which allowed rule-breaking content to stay online because it was considered in the public interest by default. But while this announcement appears to end that blanket protection, it doesn’t get rid of it completely, and it does not address in any more detail how Facebook will determine whether something falls under the exception. \nWho made this decision?\nThe announcement was authored by Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president of global affairs, but refers throughout to “we.” However, it does not specify who at Facebook was involved in the decision-making process—which is important for transparency and credibility, given the controversial nature of the decision. \n“We know today’s decision will be criticized by many people on opposing sides of the political divide—but our job is to make a decision in as proportionate, fair, and transparent a way as possible,” Clegg wrote. \nWhere will Facebook get advice?\nThe announcement also says that the company will look to “experts” to “assess whether the risk to public safety has receded,” without specifying which experts these will be, what expertise they will bring, or how Facebook (or, again, who at Facebook) will have decision-making authority based on their insights. The Oversight Board, which was intended partly as a way of outsourcing controversial decisions, has already signaled that it does not wish to perform that role.\nThis means that knowing whose voice will matter to Facebook, and who will have authority to act on the advice, is especially important—particularly given the high stakes. Conflict assessment and violence analysis are specialized fields, and ones in which Facebook’s previous responses do not inspire much confidence. Three years ago, for example, the United Nations accused the company of being “slow and ineffective” in responding to the spread of hatred online that led to attacks on the Rohingya minority in Myanmar.

Moreover, we reflect on the necessity of loving your customer’s problem, not your solution, and we embrace a comprehensive primer on how innovators can use the JTBD framework to create successful products.\n \r\n\r\nLastly, we appreciate a new academic paper on the effectiveness of Scrum teams.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you miss the previous Food for Agile Thought’s issue #294?\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

It’s because we’re willing to go back a step and rework something <em>until </em>it works for our ideal audience or customer.</p><p>But that’s also why Lori Greiner, of <em>Shark Tank</em>, said</p><blockquote>“Entrepreneurs are the only people who will work 80 hours a week to avoid working 40 hours a week for someone else.”</blockquote><p>It’s that need and desire to see our creations succeed and take on a life of their own that can lead us to use our own life energy to fuel it.</p><p>It might sound dramatic, but the entrepreneur that burns the candle at both ends isn’t just common, it’s a rite of passage. If you’ve not worked every day for long hours, bending over backwards to make your business a success, are you really an entrepreneur? And this lifestyle raises the question: <strong>can our mental wellness survive the entrepreneurial journey?</strong></p><h3>The Work-Life Balance Myth</h3><p>Ask any self-employed person about work-life balance, and they’ll likely laugh at you. “Work-life balance?” they’ll say. “What’s that?” The chances are, even if they <em>do </em>take a day or two off, they’re not really absent. They’re checking their emails, replying to DMs, and otherwise ensuring no client is having a crisis or that their employees are keeping things ticking over.</p><p>It has been argued that work-life balance is a myth for anyone working a full-time job, because the majority of your day and your thinking time (usually 40 hours a week, often more) are taken up by your job. If you’re lucky, you’ve got the kind of job you can leave at your desk, and when you leave at 5 pm on a Friday, you don’t have to think about it again until Monday morning.</p><p>That’s simply not how the birth of a business works. At least, it’s not without some serious boundary-building, and ideally, clients that also want to go home for the weekend and not think about work until Monday. If you have anything else, however, it’s almost impossible to escape.</p><p>This constant need and knowing that there could be a problem happening without your knowledge can be crippling, and is what leads so many entrepreneurs to be glued to their desks or smartphones. It’s what causes stress dreams and often leads entrepreneurs to do nothing but go to work, come home, and sleep.</p><p>This is a routine no one’s mental health can survive, and the only way to “fix” this has to come from within. When you’re the brainpower behind a startup, no one is going to tell you to take it easy or that they’ll take care of anything that happens for the next few days. That can only come from hiring well, and having established systems that allow you to relax.</p><h3>The Highs and Lows of Entrepreneurship</h3><p>So, why do we put ourselves through it? Because the highs are <strong>high</strong>. From the moment someone first buys your idea, you’re hooked. Knowing that you have made something from nothing and made it a living, breathing business is what leads entrepreneurs to sell one business and immediately start their next.</p><p>Knowing that you’re at the root of your success and you’ve changed other people’s lives with what you’ve created is something worth all those long hours.</p><p>So, is there a way to protect your mental health as an entrepreneur? Fortunately, <strong>yes</strong>. Of course, our mental health will always fluctuate in how good or bad we feel, but there are a number of things we can do to ensure we don’t feel unable to look away from our businesses, as if we’re awaiting disaster.</p><h3>How to Protect Your Mental Wellness as an Entrepreneur</h3><p><strong>Set working hours: </strong>This goes for your day, but it goes for your tasks, too. By blocking out your time for tasks, you’ll find that how long things take you to complete shrinks. Tasks take the time allowed — so if you know you can get something done in 15 minutes, give yourself 20 to do it. Give yourself the entire day, and it will take the entire day. Say that unless there’s an emergency, you’re stopping at 5 or 6pm.</p><p><strong>Build in breaks:</strong> If you’ve never tried using the Pomodoro method of time management, give it a try. This is where you work for a certain amount of time and then take a break. Traditionally, it’s 25 minutes on with a 5-minute break, but I find 30 minutes working, 5 minutes off, and repeated 3 times before a 15-minute break is the most productive cycle for me — so experiment with what’s best for you.</p><p><strong>Make sure you have a hobby:</strong> If all your projects are centered around your business and your job, you’ll never feel like you can escape and it will lead you to burnout. Sometimes, burnout will feel like exhaustion for a week or two, and sometimes it leads people to fall sick or have to throw in the towel entirely. Protect yourself by giving yourself things you do and/or create just for fun.</p><p><strong>Take time for yourself in the mornings:</strong> You don’t need to have a whole miracle morning routine, but if the last thing you do before bed is reply to emails, and the first thing you do when you wake up is the same, your mind won’t ever get space just to exist and process. Set your do not disturb time on your phone and spend half an hour in the morning waking up. If you feel the need to check for emergencies, do, but then take your half-hour (or more!) to look after yourself.</p><p><strong>Keep your workspace and your home space separate: </strong>Even if you work from home (as most of us have through 2020!), keep your workspace and home space separate. Don’t work from your sofa, and splash out and have a couple of computers or a tablet that you use just for relaxing. When the day is done, put your work computer to sleep (no notification sounds) and don’t come back to it until the morning <em>after </em>your “me” time.</p><p>Creating something new is addictive, but it can lead us to abandon all other aspects of self-care and being social in the name of “finishing”. The thing is when it comes to business — there is no finished. There’s no final deadline for your project, and so you will rush from one “last minute assignment” to the next.</p><p>The only way to combat this and protect your creativity over the long term is to put space between you and what is currently your main source of income. This space is difficult to create, but crucial to our mental health and to the quality of what we produce.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=18b5e10e4623\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/work-life-balance-can-it-exist-for-entrepreneurs-18b5e10e4623\">Work-Life Balance: Can it Exist for Entrepreneurs?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh\">The Startup</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"“Entrepreneurs are the only people who will work 80 hours a week to avoid working 40 hours a week for someone else.” — Lori Greiner, Shark Tank\nPhoto: Envato Elements\nInspiration and the excitement of creation are addictive feelings.

If you’re lucky, you’ve got the kind of job you can leave at your desk, and when you leave at 5 pm on a Friday, you don’t have to think about it again until Monday morning.\nThat’s simply not how the birth of a business works. At least, it’s not without some serious boundary-building, and ideally, clients that also want to go home for the weekend and not think about work until Monday. If you have anything else, however, it’s almost impossible to escape.\nThis constant need and knowing that there could be a problem happening without your knowledge can be crippling, and is what leads so many entrepreneurs to be glued to their desks or smartphones. It’s what causes stress dreams and often leads entrepreneurs to do nothing but go to work, come home, and sleep.\nThis is a routine no one’s mental health can survive, and the only way to “fix” this has to come from within. When you’re the brainpower behind a startup, no one is going to tell you to take it easy or that they’ll take care of anything that happens for the next few days. That can only come from hiring well, and having established systems that allow you to relax.\nThe Highs and Lows of Entrepreneurship\nSo, why do we put ourselves through it? Because the highs are high. From the moment someone first buys your idea, you’re hooked. Knowing that you have made something from nothing and made it a living, breathing business is what leads entrepreneurs to sell one business and immediately start their next.\nKnowing that you’re at the root of your success and you’ve changed other people’s lives with what you’ve created is something worth all those long hours.\nSo, is there a way to protect your mental health as an entrepreneur? Fortunately, yes. Of course, our mental health will always fluctuate in how good or bad we feel, but there are a number of things we can do to ensure we don’t feel unable to look away from our businesses, as if we’re awaiting disaster.\nHow to Protect Your Mental Wellness as an Entrepreneur\nSet working hours: This goes for your day, but it goes for your tasks, too. By blocking out your time for tasks, you’ll find that how long things take you to complete shrinks. Tasks take the time allowed — so if you know you can get something done in 15 minutes, give yourself 20 to do it. Give yourself the entire day, and it will take the entire day. Say that unless there’s an emergency, you’re stopping at 5 or 6pm.\nBuild in breaks: If you’ve never tried using the Pomodoro method of time management, give it a try. This is where you work for a certain amount of time and then take a break. Traditionally, it’s 25 minutes on with a 5-minute break, but I find 30 minutes working, 5 minutes off, and repeated 3 times before a 15-minute break is the most productive cycle for me — so experiment with what’s best for you.\nMake sure you have a hobby: If all your projects are centered around your business and your job, you’ll never feel like you can escape and it will lead you to burnout. Sometimes, burnout will feel like exhaustion for a week or two, and sometimes it leads people to fall sick or have to throw in the towel entirely. Protect yourself by giving yourself things you do and/or create just for fun.\nTake time for yourself in the mornings: You don’t need to have a whole miracle morning routine, but if the last thing you do before bed is reply to emails, and the first thing you do when you wake up is the same, your mind won’t ever get space just to exist and process. Set your do not disturb time on your phone and spend half an hour in the morning waking up. If you feel the need to check for emergencies, do, but then take your half-hour (or more!) to look after yourself.\nKeep your workspace and your home space separate: Even if you work from home (as most of us have through 2020!), keep your workspace and home space separate. Don’t work from your sofa, and splash out and have a couple of computers or a tablet that you use just for relaxing. When the day is done, put your work computer to sleep (no notification sounds) and don’t come back to it until the morning after your “me” time.\nCreating something new is addictive, but it can lead us to abandon all other aspects of self-care and being social in the name of “finishing”. The thing is when it comes to business — there is no finished. There’s no final deadline for your project, and so you will rush from one “last minute assignment” to the next.\nThe only way to combat this and protect your creativity over the long term is to put space between you and what is currently your main source of income. This space is difficult to create, but crucial to our mental health and to the quality of what we produce.\n\nWork-Life Balance: Can it Exist for Entrepreneurs? was originally published in The Startup on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Hussain Almossawi","guid":"https://medium.com/p/18b5e10e4623","categories":["lifestyle","work-life-balance","entrepreneurship","mental-health","time-management"],"isoDate":"2021-06-03T16:18:01.000Z"},{"creator":"Marguerite Faure","title":"YouTube Isn’t Dead: How to Build and Grow Your Channel in 2021","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/youtube-isnt-dead-how-to-build-and-grow-your-channel-in-2021-70c4b9fd224?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:48:05 GMT","dc:creator":"Marguerite Faure","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/youtube-isnt-dead-how-to-build-and-grow-your-channel-in-2021-70c4b9fd224?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*TlWC9FaMVj5Y0LJX\" width=\"4480\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">Cutting through the mass of information to bring you the strategies you need to know</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/youtube-isnt-dead-how-to-build-and-grow-your-channel-in-2021-70c4b9fd224?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\">Continue reading on The Startup »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"Cutting through the mass of information to bring you the strategies you need to know\nContinue reading on The Startup »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/70c4b9fd224","categories":["youtube","marketing","social-media","entrepreneur","tutorial"],"isoDate":"2021-06-03T13:48:05.000Z"},{"creator":"Zulie Rane","title":"Writing for Platforms Has Sucked the Creativity Out of Your Brain","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/writing-for-platforms-has-sucked-the-creativity-out-of-your-brain-456374005723?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:23:58 GMT","dc:creator":"Zulie Rane","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/writing-for-platforms-has-sucked-the-creativity-out-of-your-brain-456374005723?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*xgMIGZ5LvsBnv8vr7m8FRw.jpeg\" width=\"4032\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">Can I be honest?

What Watson was seeing was the emergence of thousands of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/we-hiked-along-with-cicada-biologists-so-you-dont-have-to/\">Brood X</a> cicadas, part of a billions-strong insect swarm that has lain dormant for 17 years before arising to “scream,” mate— all over about three thunderous weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watson had spent the past 20 years in Las Vegas, but moved to the Blue Ridge Mountains in Georgia last year. She’d seen social media posts about the cicadas, which emerge once in a generation across a huge swath of the eastern United States, but figured they were just the usual summer bugs that she’d heard her entire life. “I thought, ‘What’s the big deal?’” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faced with an onslaught of bizarre creatures, though, she suddenly understood what the big deal was—and did what any modern human would do: She Googled it. Within minutes, she had downloaded <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cicada-safari/id1446471492\">Cicada Safari</a>, a cicada-tracking app.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re getting 16,000 photos a day, and at this rate, we are very likely to get half a million observations.” </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps like iNaturalist, PictureThis, and PlantIn have become popular respites from the pandemic. Many of these apps act as a digital resource, and allow users to submit photos and video for scientific study. Their success inspired Cicada Safari’s creator Gene Kritsky, an entomologist and biology professor at Mount St. Joseph University, to create his own service as a way of tracking Brood X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crowdsourcing has long been a way of gathering information for an event that only happens once in a generation, says Kritsky. Researchers in 1858 wrote to newspaper editors urging them to get readers to write in with observations, while postcards were popular in the first half of the 20th century. By the late 1980s, Kritsky was using a telephone hotline that would often get so drowned in tips that the tape on his voicemail machine would get jammed. In 2004, during the last emergence of Brood X, he urged people to send in observations via email with photos attached. He received about 1,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cicada Safari app allows users to track sightings of cicadas on a map, as well as take photos of insects they spot and submit them to the app. And it is riding a wave, with nearly 180,000 downloads as of publication — not bad for a piece of software that most people won’t use beyond the three-week lifespan of the insects. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The app has blown away Kritsky’s goal of 5,000 observations, he says. As of June 2, “we have over 400,000 cicada photos submitted,” he says. “We’re getting 16,000 photos a day, and at this rate, we are very likely to get half a million observations.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A team of 20 volunteers, including his wife, sift through each photo by hand, checking to make sure the images are clearly visible ones of a Brood X cicada; if the images aren’t clear, they’re deleted. Kritsky hopes that by the time the next major cicada explosion emerges in 2024—a brood in northern Illinois that emerges on a 13-year cycle—he’ll have figured out a way to use artificial intelligence to do the painstaking work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>“I’m just in awe”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Cicada Safari is the only cicada tracker on the US App Store, it is capitalizing on some key trends. Nature-based services tap people’s enjoyment of hikes and outdoor parks as the safest way to interact with others during the pandemic, whether they are vaccinated or not. Citizen science apps, meanwhile, offer a family friendly activity that allows anyone to record and submit natural observations. Michelle Watson feels her submissions to the app are “my small way of contributing to that research.” When you’re stuck at home, an app that makes you feel productive and helpful rather than reminding you of an emptying bank account can be powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s reflected in the breadth of people engaging in citizen science. Kritsky says Cicada Safari does not collect data on who is using its service, but has seen photos from users of different ethnicities, often with children, and older people in the background. “We wanted the interface to be really simple,” Kritsky says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizen science apps have succeeded in opening up the conversation and work of research to many people with no science background. Watson, a former paralegal, has now joined a Facebook group dedicated to tracking cicadas, and is also on a group chat with fellow enthusiasts. The app’s leaderboard—a ranking of the top 500 submittors of usable cicada images—shows that she’s currently holding the&nbsp; No.2 spot in the country, with 3,785 photos at the time of publishing (the leader is at nearly 7,000.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I can already tell how my return to work will go after this little staycation. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f9f5.png\" alt=\"🧵\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><br><br>Coworker: How was your long weekend?<br><br>Me: Fantastic!

Janet Sun, a 23-year-old graduate student in Maryland, remembers the last emergence of Brood X, and fondly recalls picking up their shedded exoskeletons. “It was a magical memory for me,” Sun said in a Twitter DM. “I had the impression they were three inches long because I was so much smaller last time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watson agrees. “I have never seen anything like this,” she says. “They curl out of the ground, climb up the tree, molt, and inflate their wings in a matter of a few hours. You see their life cycle right before your eyes. I’m just in awe.”</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"A few weeks ago, Michelle Watson woke up to a deafening, steadily oscillating screech. “What the heck is that noise?” she wondered.\nShe went outside to her yard and saw hundreds of beady-eyed insects enrobed in a thick shell of gold emerging out of the ground and crawling up the trees.

She’d seen social media posts about the cicadas, which emerge once in a generation across a huge swath of the eastern United States, but figured they were just the usual summer bugs that she’d heard her entire life. “I thought, ‘What’s the big deal?’” she says.\nFaced with an onslaught of bizarre creatures, though, she suddenly understood what the big deal was—and did what any modern human would do: She Googled it. Within minutes, she had downloaded Cicada Safari, a cicada-tracking app.\n\n“We’re getting 16,000 photos a day, and at this rate, we are very likely to get half a million observations.” \n\n\n\n\nApps like iNaturalist, PictureThis, and PlantIn have become popular respites from the pandemic. Many of these apps act as a digital resource, and allow users to submit photos and video for scientific study. Their success inspired Cicada Safari’s creator Gene Kritsky, an entomologist and biology professor at Mount St. Joseph University, to create his own service as a way of tracking Brood X.\nCrowdsourcing has long been a way of gathering information for an event that only happens once in a generation, says Kritsky. Researchers in 1858 wrote to newspaper editors urging them to get readers to write in with observations, while postcards were popular in the first half of the 20th century. By the late 1980s, Kritsky was using a telephone hotline that would often get so drowned in tips that the tape on his voicemail machine would get jammed. In 2004, during the last emergence of Brood X, he urged people to send in observations via email with photos attached. He received about 1,000.\nCicada Safari app allows users to track sightings of cicadas on a map, as well as take photos of insects they spot and submit them to the app. And it is riding a wave, with nearly 180,000 downloads as of publication — not bad for a piece of software that most people won’t use beyond the three-week lifespan of the insects. \nThe app has blown away Kritsky’s goal of 5,000 observations, he says. As of June 2, “we have over 400,000 cicada photos submitted,” he says. “We’re getting 16,000 photos a day, and at this rate, we are very likely to get half a million observations.” \nA team of 20 volunteers, including his wife, sift through each photo by hand, checking to make sure the images are clearly visible ones of a Brood X cicada; if the images aren’t clear, they’re deleted. Kritsky hopes that by the time the next major cicada explosion emerges in 2024—a brood in northern Illinois that emerges on a 13-year cycle—he’ll have figured out a way to use artificial intelligence to do the painstaking work.\n“I’m just in awe”\nAlthough Cicada Safari is the only cicada tracker on the US App Store, it is capitalizing on some key trends. Nature-based services tap people’s enjoyment of hikes and outdoor parks as the safest way to interact with others during the pandemic, whether they are vaccinated or not. Citizen science apps, meanwhile, offer a family friendly activity that allows anyone to record and submit natural observations. Michelle Watson feels her submissions to the app are “my small way of contributing to that research.” When you’re stuck at home, an app that makes you feel productive and helpful rather than reminding you of an emptying bank account can be powerful.\nThat’s reflected in the breadth of people engaging in citizen science. Kritsky says Cicada Safari does not collect data on who is using its service, but has seen photos from users of different ethnicities, often with children, and older people in the background. “We wanted the interface to be really simple,” Kritsky says. \nCitizen science apps have succeeded in opening up the conversation and work of research to many people with no science background. Watson, a former paralegal, has now joined a Facebook group dedicated to tracking cicadas, and is also on a group chat with fellow enthusiasts. The app’s leaderboard—a ranking of the top 500 submittors of usable cicada images—shows that she’s currently holding the  No.2 spot in the country, with 3,785 photos at the time of publishing (the leader is at nearly 7,000.)\n\n\nI can already tell how my return to work will go after this little staycation. \nCoworker: How was your long weekend?\nMe: Fantastic! I made it into the 5000s on the Cicada Safari Leaderboard!\nCoworker: pic.twitter.com/up92p08fOv\n— Juanita Constible (@JMConstible) May 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nBut perhaps what unites these communities most is a feeling that has become foreign to many during the pandemic: awe. Janet Sun, a 23-year-old graduate student in Maryland, remembers the last emergence of Brood X, and fondly recalls picking up their shedded exoskeletons. “It was a magical memory for me,” Sun said in a Twitter DM. “I had the impression they were three inches long because I was so much smaller last time.”\nWatson agrees. “I have never seen anything like this,” she says. “They curl out of the ground, climb up the tree, molt, and inflate their wings in a matter of a few hours. You see their life cycle right before your eyes. I’m just in awe.”","dc:creator":"Tanya Basu","content":"A few weeks ago, Michelle Watson woke up to a deafening, steadily oscillating screech. “What the heck is that noise?” she wondered.

And more success means more time, less stress, and ultimately a more meaningful life.</em></blockquote><p>Mental models can indeed have a wide-ranging impact on your life. But more clearer thinking also means more time <em>for the most meaningful parts of the product</em>, less stress <em>about making decisions,</em> and ultimately more meaningful <em>product outcomes.</em></p><p>Mental models are vast, and even Shane’s collection is too big to summarize here. But below are <strong>five mental models to help you make better decisions and hone your product sense.</strong></p><h3>The Map is Not the Territory</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/519/0*y3JgU69YjlW4gZRz.png\" /></figure><p>When you’re visiting a national park, the crinkled map in your pocket does not fully represent the majesty in front of you. The map is not an accurate 1:1 representation of the territory, but it is invaluable as you try to find your way back to camp. If that’s too meta for you, think of the financial statements for your company. These statements distill thousands of data points into something much more straightforward and valuable for your leadership team.</p><p>That’s what maps are — a helpful summary to simplify reality. And <strong>remembering</strong> that is what this mental model is all about. We have to acknowledge maps aren’t comprehensive and that they can be snapshots in time.</p><p>Maps exist all around us. This blog post maps mental models (now there’s meta for you). But what about in Product? <strong>What are common <em>Product Management Maps? </em></strong>Here are a few:</p><ul><li>The core assumptions about what we should build.</li><li>Dashboards of user behavior summarizing trends.</li><li>Feedback from internal teams like Sales or Support.</li><li>Your executive team’s desired roadmap. Or better yet, all roadmaps. It’s literally in the damn name!</li></ul><p>So how do we use maps responsibly and avoid the pitfall of mistaking maps as the territory? Parish gives us three tactics to consider, and I’ll give you three hypotheticals to apply them as a PM.</p><p><strong>1. Reality is the ultimate update. We can and should update maps based on our own experiences in the territory. That’s how good maps are built: feedback loops created by explorers.</strong></p><p>Imagine your support team discovered a bug with the recent release. Their map consists of a bug ticket with how to reproduce and the <em>expected impact on customers.</em> It insists this is an all-hands-on-deck situation. But we discover customers aren’t hitting the issue often. And the few that are have found workarounds. <em>Our map needs updating to reflect this new reality</em> — we need to fix the problem, but the priority is minor.</p><p><strong>2. Consider the cartographer. Maps are not purely objective creations.

His last performance review was all about this roadmap. But those features and problems aren’t showing up in our research. We cannot take this map at face value. It’s a reflection of Cartographer Craig’s desire to deliver an easy win at the next board meeting. As Product folk, we have to be constantly aware of the cartographer’s impact on the maps around us.</p><p><strong>3. Maps can influence territories — a cautionary tale of what can happen when we try to fit complexity into the simplification.</strong></p><p>Usage dashboards are maps that influence <em>what</em> we measure but also how we iterate. We want to build sticky products that keep customers returning to core actions that correlate with business outcomes. But measuring the right indicators can sometimes feel a bit like rocket science. If we measure the wrong things, our maps are no longer useful in leading to the treasure (the business outcome). We’ve all seen the over-excited PM with his vanity metrics dashboard. If we measure behavior X, but it has no impact on desired outcome Y — our reality will worsen for our customers and our business.</p><h3>First Principles Thinking</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/0*lwDL1NwBLl6VItCG.png\" /></figure><blockquote>First principles are the boundaries we have to work within situations in life. They do not provide a checklist of things that will always be true; our knowledge of first principles changes as we understand more. <strong>But they are the foundation on which we can build.</strong></blockquote><p>First principle thinking is all about being able to reverse complicated situations and <em>unlock the creative outcomes underneath</em>. It’s about separating underlying ideas and facts from the assumptions based on them.</p><p>The better understanding of first principles, the more freedom we have to navigate the situation. The scientist with a deep knowledge of thermodynamics who happens to be a car hobbyist will have more effective and creative solutions for rebuilding an engine than an amateur reading a manual.</p><p>But what about first principles in product thinking? We’re not exactly talking about the rules of the universe here. This model applied to our world looks like <strong>product principles.</strong> These can and will vary based on the company, market segment, and product. But at their best, they are guiding truths about the market and your customers.</p><p><strong>Let’s look at Netflix.</strong> I’m sure they have many product principles, but let’s pretend one is: <strong>We delight the Most.</strong> In all-out streaming wars, the Red N believes that having the best user experience is key to their victory. They have metrics that help them know if they’re moving toward that principle being true or not. With their principle in place and the metrics to guide them, the product team is <em>set free to explore while staying within the bounds of what matters.</em> To <em>delight the most</em>, they might experiment with:</p><ul><li>Custom playback speeds</li><li>8k resolution</li><li>Collaborative watch parties</li><li>Plenty of other potential features</li></ul><p>Whatever the solution, it has to drive towards the first principle. Using this mental model effectively can help us establish the guiding lights for our teams while ensuring they’re genuinely empowered.</p><h3>Second-Order Thinking</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/308/0*HLdsEBD8wrw_lGli.png\" /></figure><blockquote>Thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences but the subsequent effects of those actions. Failing to consider the second-and third-order effects can unleash disaster</blockquote><p>We’ve all seen the scary headlines about how bacteria are becoming resistant to our medicine. This alarming problem comes from the food and medical industry not heeding the subsequent effects of overprescribing and overusing. Over-optimizing for short-term gains and bandaids has led to a much bigger problem and risk to profits.</p><p>This type of thinking can be a Product Manager’s superpower — and it’s good for business. It also makes you more effective in persuasion. If you can demonstrate you’ve gamed out the scenario, you’ll rightly inspire more confidence in your pitch.</p><p><strong>Build loyalty and trust.</strong> Happy customers and employees are the lifeblood of software companies, especially in the SaaS space. There is an endless supply of stories about companies deciding to move their bottom line but ultimately reversing it because of an uproar. You can optimize for profits this quarter, but if it tanks your ARR later — it’s not worth it.</p><p>It doesn’t have to be a feature decision. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion\">Basecamp’s recent company policy change is a perfect example</a>. Did their founders game out the second-and-third-order impact? Would they have made the same decision if they knew it’d cost them half their employees and alienate a good portion of their customer base?</p><p><strong>Optimize for long-term product outcomes.</strong> Second-order thinking also helps us optimize for the right time horizons. Is this quarter’s easy win worth moving us further away from our target market? Are the COGS associated with this new feature sustainable for our business model? Master this thinking to help you and your team avoid short-term performance theater and focus on what matters most.</p><p><strong>Avoid the siren’s call of analysis paralysis.</strong> Nobody can Dr. Strange it and run through the endless outcomes before putting a plan in place.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/460/0*ZcoICbw0gCeIMqPR.gif\" /></figure><p>If we were to <em>only</em> rely on this mental model when making product decisions, we’d move too slow. We need complementary models, just like we need <a href=\"https://productmanagerhq.com/pms-metrics-counter-metrics/\">counter metrics</a>. Leveraging second-order thinking alongside first-principle thinking can be powerful. First principles help us build product intuition and speed, while second-order thinking gives us careful examination. Together, they help us move fast AND smart.</p><h3>Inversion</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/296/0*SjFkyBAvamgj1LI7.png\" /></figure><blockquote><em>Inversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is “invert,” which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool, it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point.</em></blockquote><p>It’s natural for humans to approach problems from the starting line. Where are we at today, and how do we get to where we want to go? Inversion allows us to flip it and reverse it. This model encourages us to look at a problem from all angles.</p><p><strong>Start at your desired end state.</strong> In Product, we have plans and goals for our business and customer. If you want to achieve a particular outcome, think about <em>what else would have to be true if you already reached it.</em> Let’s think about what YouTube wants most — folks watching videos on their platform.</p><p>Their desired end state might be an average session one hour long. If a user spent an hour on YouTube, what else has to be true? They would have to tolerate ads enough not to close the video while waiting for their content. Most content is super long-form, so they would also have to watch multiple videos each time they visit. In this simplified hypothetical, YouTube can now work backward and build better ad-targeting and video recommendations.</p><p><strong>Inverse to avoid disaster.</strong> Another way to approach the mental model is by considering worst-case scenarios. The pre-mortem is a staple here. We want to retain our customers. Use inversion to understand what would have to be true if they left for a competitor. For example, what would cause an exodus of users from Twitch? Here’s one — a <em>majority</em> of the top streamers signing an exclusive deal with some a competitor. Twitch could use this inversion to implement a strategy around creator partnerships.</p><h3>Your Circle of Competence</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*hBsWF2Fl_ahZm7uL.png\" /></figure><p>Our last mental model is all about understanding your bounds and continually improving. A circle of competence is mastery of a particular area. It can take to build. We cannot fake actual knowledge of a complex territory.</p><blockquote>How do you know when you have a circle of competence? Within our circles of competence, we know exactly what we don’t know. We are able to make decisions quickly and relatively accurately. We possess detailed knowledge of additional information we might need to make a decision with full understanding, or even what information is unobtainable. We know what is knowable and what is unknowable and can distinguish between the two.</blockquote><p>It’s not enough to learn the great mental models and apply them occasionally. To truly get the value out of these logic nuggets, you need to measure your performance. A decision journal is a great way to do this. Did you use the correct mental model? What were the results? What did it say about your product sense? Tell the truth. Evaluate yourself and your thinking. Learn, iterate, and improve.</p><p><strong>You wouldn’t launch a new product without a cohesive set of logs and dashboards to measure success. In the same way, you shouldn’t employ new ways of thinking without measuring its impact.</strong></p><p>We just went through five mental models to make you a better PM. It was a ton of info, and it barely scratched the surface of the great mental models. I’d love to hear from you. What’d I miss here? What models are your favorite tools?

Failing to consider the second-and third-order effects can unleash disaster\nWe’ve all seen the scary headlines about how bacteria are becoming resistant to our medicine.

First principles help us build product intuition and speed, while second-order thinking gives us careful examination. Together, they help us move fast AND smart.\nInversion\n\nInversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is “invert,” which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool, it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point.\nIt’s natural for humans to approach problems from the starting line. Where are we at today, and how do we get to where we want to go? Inversion allows us to flip it and reverse it. This model encourages us to look at a problem from all angles.\nStart at your desired end state. In Product, we have plans and goals for our business and customer.

Let’s think about what YouTube wants most — folks watching videos on their platform.\nTheir desired end state might be an average session one hour long.

Most content is super long-form, so they would also have to watch multiple videos each time they visit. In this simplified hypothetical, YouTube can now work backward and build better ad-targeting and video recommendations.\nInverse to avoid disaster. Another way to approach the mental model is by considering worst-case scenarios. The pre-mortem is a staple here. We want to retain our customers. Use inversion to understand what would have to be true if they left for a competitor. For example, what would cause an exodus of users from Twitch? Here’s one — a majority of the top streamers signing an exclusive deal with some a competitor. Twitch could use this inversion to implement a strategy around creator partnerships.\nYour Circle of Competence\n\nOur last mental model is all about understanding your bounds and continually improving. A circle of competence is mastery of a particular area. It can take to build. We cannot fake actual knowledge of a complex territory.\nHow do you know when you have a circle of competence? Within our circles of competence, we know exactly what we don’t know. We are able to make decisions quickly and relatively accurately. We possess detailed knowledge of additional information we might need to make a decision with full understanding, or even what information is unobtainable. We know what is knowable and what is unknowable and can distinguish between the two.\nIt’s not enough to learn the great mental models and apply them occasionally. To truly get the value out of these logic nuggets, you need to measure your performance. A decision journal is a great way to do this. Did you use the correct mental model? What were the results? What did it say about your product sense? Tell the truth. Evaluate yourself and your thinking. Learn, iterate, and improve.\nYou wouldn’t launch a new product without a cohesive set of logs and dashboards to measure success. In the same way, you shouldn’t employ new ways of thinking without measuring its impact.\nWe just went through five mental models to make you a better PM. It was a ton of info, and it barely scratched the surface of the great mental models. I’d love to hear from you. What’d I miss here? What models are your favorite tools? Which apply the most to our daily lives as Product Managers? Let me know in the comments.\nAll quotes and images in this post are from The Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts.\n\nFive Mental Models to Improve Your Product Sense and Decision-Making was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Austin Nichols","guid":"https://medium.com/p/5f927e954f8b","categories":["mental-models","product-management","product-thinking"],"isoDate":"2021-06-03T08:56:05.000Z"},{"creator":"Aaron Dinin, PhD","title":"Are You Building Your Startup Backwards?","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-building-your-startup-backwards-1bafbf6e8996?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 08:32:45 GMT","dc:creator":"Aaron Dinin, PhD","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-building-your-startup-backwards-1bafbf6e8996?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*LPEEZLOvN6BfHPmh\" width=\"700\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">It&#x2019;s a problem that plagues nearly every entrepreneur, and most never even know it</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-building-your-startup-backwards-1bafbf6e8996?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\">Continue reading on The Startup »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"It’s a problem that plagues nearly every entrepreneur, and most never even know it\nContinue reading on The Startup »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/1bafbf6e8996","categories":["startup","founders","work","business","entrepreneurship"],"isoDate":"2021-06-03T08:32:45.000Z"},{"creator":"Marguerite Faure","title":"5 Reasons Why a Coworking Office Space Will Increase Your Productivity","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/5-reasons-why-a-coworking-office-space-will-increase-your-productivity-3355d6dea44?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 06:18:04 GMT","dc:creator":"Marguerite Faure","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/5-reasons-why-a-coworking-office-space-will-increase-your-productivity-3355d6dea44?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1280/1*2ufmVKqtfWJWfkDgROSQpw.png\" width=\"1280\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">An inside look at how the coworking environment increased my output as a creative</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/5-reasons-why-a-coworking-office-space-will-increase-your-productivity-3355d6dea44?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\">Continue reading on The Startup »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"An inside look at how the coworking environment increased my output as a creative\nContinue reading on The Startup »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/3355d6dea44","categories":["freelancing","personal-development","startup","productivity","entrepreneurship"],"isoDate":"2021-06-03T06:18:04.000Z"},{"creator":"Jamie Logie","title":"How to Find the Best Ad Network For Your Website/Blog","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-find-the-best-ad-network-for-your-website-blog-e5c8fa08122d?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 03:47:16 GMT","dc:creator":"Jamie Logie","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-find-the-best-ad-network-for-your-website-blog-e5c8fa08122d?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*eOTz4lvEJOpF1HYq\" width=\"4820\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">Do you get a lot of traffic?

The challenge for a chief information security officer (CISO) is talking to the board of directors in a way they can understand and support the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s drilled into the heads of board directors and the C-suite by scary data-breach headlines, lawyers, lawsuits, and risk managers: cybersecurity is high-risk. It’s got to be on the list of a company’s top priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=MIT1834968946\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niall Browne, senior vice president and chief information security officer at Palo Alto Networks, says that you can look at the CISO-board discussion as being a classic sales pitch: successful CISOs will know how to close the deal just like the best salespeople do. “That&#8217;s what makes a really good salesperson: the person that has the pitch to close” he says. “They have the ability to close the deal. So they ask for something.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For ages,” Browne says, CISOs have had two big problems with boards. First, they haven’t been able speak the same language so that the board could understand what the issues were. The second problem: “There was no ask.” You can go in front of a board and give your presentation, and the directors can look like they’re in agreement, nodding or shaking their heads, and you can think to yourself, “Job done. They’re updated.” But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the business’s security posture is any better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why it’s important for CISOs to raise the board’s understanding to the level where they know what’s needed and why. Especially when it comes to new advances in cybersecurity, like attack surface management, which is “probably one of the areas that CISOs focus least on and yet is the most important,” Browne says. For example, “many times the CISO and the security team may not be able to see the wood from the trees because they&#8217;re so involved in it.” And to do that, CISOs need a set of metrics so that anybody can read a board deck and within minutes understand what the CISO is trying to get across, Browne says. “Because for the most part, the data is there, but there&#8217;s no context behind it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full <strong>transcript</strong>:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel Ruma</em>: From MIT Technology Review, I’m Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our topic today is cybersecurity and corporate accountability. In recent years, cybersecurity has become a board level concern with damaged reputation, lost revenue and enormous amounts of data stolen. As the attack surface grows, chief information security officers will have increasing accountability for knowing where to expect the next attack and how to explain how it happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two words for you: outside-in visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guest is Niall Browne, who’s the senior vice president and chief information security officer at Palo Alto Networks. Niall has decades of experience in managing global security, compliance and risk management programs for financial institutions, cloud providers and technology services companies. He&#8217;s on Google’s CISO advisory board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome, Niall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall Browne</em>: Excellent. Thank you, Laurel, for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So as a chief information security officer, or a CISO, you’re responsible for securing both Palo Alto Networks’ products and the company itself. But you’re not securing just any old company; you’re securing a security company that secures other companies. How is that different?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: Yes, so I think, the beautiful thing about Palo Alto Networks is that we’re the largest cybersecurity company in the world. So we really get to see what an awful lot of companies never get to see. And if you think about it, one of the key things is, knowledge is power. So the more you know about your adversaries, what are they doing, what methods they’re attempting on the network, what are the controls that work and what are the controls that don&#8217;t work, the better you are to create your own internal strategy to help protect against those continuous attacks. And you’re in a much better position to be able to provide that data to the board so they can assure that the appropriate oversight is in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So certainly for us, with that level of knowledge of what we get to see in our networks, that really gives us the opportunity to continuously innovate. So taking our products and continuously building on those, so we can meet the customer requirements and then the industry requirements. So I think that’s probably the first part. The second part is, we&#8217;re really in this boat together. So part of my job is continuously talking to individuals in the industry and fellow CISOs, CTOs, CIOs, and CEOs talking about cybersecurity strategy. And invariably, you’ll find the same issues that they&#8217;re having are the exact same issues that we&#8217;re having. So for us, it&#8217;s really the opportunity to share, how do we ensure that we are able to continuously innovate, make a difference in the industry and really collaborate on an ongoing basis with industry leaders. Especially focusing on how we secure our business and provide best practices as to how we companies can be more secure?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So some people may be surprised that collaboration and this kind of open sharing of knowledge is so prevalent, but they shouldn’t be, right? Because how else are you going to all collectively defend against the unknown attackers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: Great question. And if you look at it on the opposite side of the fence, hackers are continuously sharing. Albeit they’re sharing for financial gain. In other words, they&#8217;ll steal data and they’ll resell it and resell it and resell it and resell it. Hackers are continuously sharing that data, including DIY toolkits. And on the security side of the house, there&#8217;s always been historically that legacy suspicion. In other words, I’m the only person who’s having this problem uniquely. And if I share this problem, they’ll think that I’m not doing a good job or the company isn&#8217;t doing a good job, or I’m the only person who’s having this specific issue. And what happened over time is, CISOs didn’t share a lot of data, which means the hackers were sharing data right left and center. But on the CISO side of the house, on the protection side, there was very little collaboration, which meant that now you had limited shared industry best practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each CISO was in their own silo, in their own pillar, doing their own unique thing, and everybody was learning from their own mistakes. So it was really a one-to-one model. You make a mistake and then you make another mistake, and then you make another mistake. However, if you could talk to your peer, imagine in business or finance, you&#8217;re continuously talking to the CTO and the CFO to say, “Oh, by the way, how did you manage such and such issue?” So I’m now seeing the industry starting to change. CISOs are now starting to change, and share. They’re continuously talking about strategy. They’re continually talking about how do they protect their environment? They’re talking about, what are some of the good business models that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you look at MIT, there’s industry and technical and business models that really work in other industries. But then, if you look in the CISO community itself, it’s like, what are those industry best practices? And now they’re only starting to get kind of formulated up, bubble up from there. And what I&#8217;m seeing, certainly over the last, I would say three or four years, there’s a tremendous growth on the CISOs in relation to learning industry best practices, and really uplevelling their skillset. So they’re just not that technical geek in the corner. They really need to be able to talk business technology, be able to talk business terms, and really be able to be seen as that close peer to that CTO, to the CIO, to the CEO in relation to solving business problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because if you think about it from a cybersecurity perspective, at the end of the day, it’s just a business problem. And if it’s a business problem, you need to apply strategic business solutions to solving those issues. Instead of talking about what version of antivirus you’re on, you really need to uplevel the conversation, so that, when you speak to the board, when you’re speaking to the same C-level executive, they’re not throwing their eyes in the air. They understand that you’re talking the same business language as them. Which means, again, if you&#8217;re a trusted business partner, then you can make a huge amount more difference in the company, as opposed to being seen as that junior IT leader in the organization that somebody only ever comes to if we get hacked or if a backup fails, or if a Mac is broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: I really like that analogy&#8230;growth of the position itself. Like you said, it does actually elevate this role to the board table because it is a business problem with a possible business solution. But how can boards then in return make better decisions? You will then also have to bring some data and information and something to help the board along with all of the other decisions they have to make across the entire company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: And that’s the key thing, is that most people, when they look at it, it&#8217;s classic sales. You can have the best salesperson in the business, but unless they have the close, and the close is the ask. Here’s a great product, and I want to sell this product, i.e., this car for, let’s say, $50,000. And then at the end of the sales pitch, will you buy the car? And that&#8217;s what makes a really good salesperson, the person that has the pitch to close. They have the ability to close the deal. So they ask for something. So I think for ages, CISOs had two big issues with the board. One is, they weren&#8217;t able to report the right data up to the board and speak the same language where the board would be able to understand what the issues were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then two, there was no ask. And that’s very important because if you go into a board and you present and everybody’s nodding and shaking their head and understanding it, sure you’ve updated them, but the security posture is none the better. And if you look at a classical board, any board itself, they’re there at a very, very high level, obviously, to serve the company. So any of the board members or any of the boards that I’ve worked with in the past, they have been extremely willing to help the business itself. So they’re always looking at, “Well, you presented X, but now, how can I help?” So I think CISOs need to flip it into more of being that salesperson with the close. Most importantly, what’s my ask?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a classic board meeting, I think that goes well, is, you sit down, you work with the board, you show a core set of metrics. Now, you don’t want to show metrics on numbers that are absolutely meaningless to the board. If you look at the board, the board has a wide range of skill sets. Some board members may be compliance experts, some may be business leaders, some may be finance leaders. So it’s really about when you communicate with the board, two sets of things. One is coming up with a set of communications or metrics, and really outlining the business case so that anybody can read a board deck, and within minutes they understand what you&#8217;re trying to get across. That&#8217;s critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a second part is, it’s not a presentation. Every board meeting should end with time at the end for questions and answers and for the ask. And I would say, a good board meeting is whereby you don’t even go through the deck. You share the deck in advance, they’ve read through it, they were able to understand your cybersecurity posture by just looking at your deck. And then the board meeting doesn&#8217;t even refer to the deck. It’s a simple set of questions, comments back and forth and then the ask. And the ask could be, “Listen, can we get some more focus on a certain area itself or more resources?” Or they may have an ask of you as well. So again, I think the model really is, communicate a core set of data and then making it a conversation with a collaborative ask from both sides versus coming up with a 30-slide deck that nobody understands that you present it and then you run out of the board meeting from there. That model just doesn’t work, as we know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Yeah. Not for anyone, right? So what specific metrics do you actually report back to the board and why are those metrics important to your board or any other board?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: The issue with any industry, including cybersecurity is, sometimes there&#8217;s just too much data. So, if you look at industry standards like ISO 27001, you may have a hundred and something controls. If you look at FedRAMP, you&#8217;ve got 300 something controls. If you look at COSO or COBIT. So you don’t want to go to the board with, “By the way, here&#8217;s 2,000 controls. And here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re in compliance with these 2,000 controls.” Because for the most part, the data is there, but there&#8217;s no context behind it. So they&#8217;re wondering, like, “AV being on 95% of end points, is that good? We scan once every, let’s say 12 hours, is that good?” So they&#8217;re what I call meaningless metrics. They have no benefit whatsoever for most InfoSec people, never mind board-level leaders. So from our point of view, we break it into simple core sets of pillars that we can measure over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And generally, you don&#8217;t want to have a set of pillars that’s 25 pillars, because that&#8217;s too many because you&#8217;re not able to measure one versus 25. So internally, we generally settle in about five major core areas that we focus in on and we measure against those each time. So one is, secure our products. Most organizations are very, very product-centric now. So products in most companies are becoming critical, critical, critical. So one thing we measure is how are we measuring? How are we protecting our products? And we rate ourselves on a scale of zero up to five being maximum maturity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you have really good products, but they&#8217;re sitting on infrastructure that&#8217;s insecure, you have an issue. So the second one is, secure our infrastructure. And the third one is detection and response. So that if you’ve got really secure products on really secure infrastructure, but nobody’s looking at it and nobody&#8217;s measuring or monitoring the environment for attacks, then you have an issue. So for us, it&#8217;s detection response is the third one, which is critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth one then is people. And the people component, it&#8217;s absolutely&#8230;I can&#8217;t stress this enough because if you don&#8217;t have people that understand cybersecurity, then you’ve got a core issue. The vast majority of times, it&#8217;s people that do something in a company accidentally, i.e., they may click on a phishing link that compromises your network. So one thing, what we call it is street smart. So one of the four pillars is, can we get people so they&#8217;re street smart? In other words, cybersecurity smart, street smart. So if they&#8217;re walking down the road and they see a stranger look suspicious, well use your gut. Same thing with cybersecurity. What are the simple things that they should do or think about on a day-to-day basis that they can protect a company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fifth one really is governance. How do we do governance and how do we manage ourselves? And how do we measure our success? So if you look at it there, it&#8217;s five simple pillars. It&#8217;s just simply product, infrastructure, detection response, people, and governance. And we measure zero to five for each of those. So then it’s very easy for the board and for other members to look at, How are we trending against those areas over time? It allows you to go high, in other words, the thousand-foot view. And then if there’s a question of infrastructure, you can look at the measurement, the infrastructure pillar, and then you can start jumping into other metrics later if they want. But really, that’s the way we articulate that, how we built our security program. And that&#8217;s something that I think that resonates very strongly with the board, because now they&#8217;re able to measure us based on known entities versus meaningless metrics that for the most part tell them nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Now, what if we switched that though? What kind of responsibility does the board have to be “street smart” and have some kind of foundational understanding of cybersecurity? Or do you take that on as your own personal responsibility to spend time with each member to make sure they understand the foundations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: Correct. So for us, it’s very much a case of taking a certain level of knowledge and then building on that knowledge so at least everybody’s on the same level of knowledge. So one example is, again, you could have somebody who&#8217;s chairing that audit committee, who&#8217;s very, very technical or very, very compliance driven. And she or he may know all about boards&#8230;audits and all the frameworks. And that&#8217;s great. And then the other side, you might have somebody who&#8217;s more finance-based or more audit-based. And then the question is, how do you work on uplevelling everybody’s skillset?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s numerous different ways of doing that. It’s two things. One is sitting down with them one-on-one and then providing an uplevel of conversation on, this is what we&#8217;re doing. This is our entire security program. This is how it works. This is what 2020 looked like. This is what 2021 looks like&#8230;so getting everybody onto the same level and building that relationship is very, very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we continuously see that whereby our board members will reach out towards us or we&#8217;ll reach out to them in sharing data, or they&#8217;ll have an idea that we haven&#8217;t thought about and we&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a really good idea. Let&#8217;s incorporate that into our program.&#8221; So I think that&#8217;s very useful. And then the second part is, it&#8217;s all about telling a story. So a story and a narrative. So if you open up a book and you start at the security side and you start at the end chapter, well, that&#8217;s not very compelling. It&#8217;s like, who&#8217;s Jane? Who&#8217;s Judy? Who&#8217;s Tim? Who&#8217;s Tony? Doesn&#8217;t make any sense whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And oftentimes, that&#8217;s what happens in cybersecurity reports is that the board is looking at&#8230;and here&#8217;s she or he that&#8217;s presenting as a CISO and they&#8217;re presenting a set of data and metrics that they don&#8217;t understand and so therefore, they can&#8217;t do anything with that. So we spend a lot of time, our first board, starting off with a basic set of principles and then each board after that, every three months or so we go into more detail incrementally, as we&#8217;re growing and as we&#8217;re building that cybersecurity deck, they get to better understand and uplevel their understanding as well. And then from their side, with that level of understanding, they can very easily jump in and say, &#8220;Oh, by the way, here&#8217;s an area I think you should be focusing in on.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on our board, we have some VC firms, obviously, that are highly technical and they&#8217;ll have a slant that they&#8217;ll want us to focus in on. I want to say, &#8220;Sure, let&#8217;s incorporate that as part of our program.&#8221; So I think I would see this as board communication as a very much back and forth communication. It shouldn&#8217;t happen once a quarter. It should not happen on a daily basis, but certainly it should happen throughout the quarter whereby a board member has an idea and then you can incorporate that as part of your best practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, at the same time, you want the staff within that company to be able to operationally run their security team. But certainly, the insights some board member can provide, in some cases are tremendously because they&#8217;ve been in that industry for numerous different years. And as part of that model, they would typically have seen what other individuals have never seen before. Plus, I think what&#8217;s mostly beneficial from there, in cybersecurity, cybersecurity, again, it&#8217;s a business problem and it&#8217;s a business process. So most of these board members are exceptional at solving business practices. Maybe not cybersecurity, but they can take a cybersecurity issue and they can relate that to another business best practices, and then leverage that one in cybersecurity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And frankly, I think that&#8217;s the best value a board can provide. Many times the CISO and the security team may not be able to see the wood from the trees because they&#8217;re so involved in it. For the board members, it&#8217;s a great kind of prism whereby they can look at it from the outside in, and they can provide insight based on, &#8220;Well, hang on a second, the way you&#8217;re solving this issue based in cybersecurity by doing a consulting model, that doesn&#8217;t work or that doesn&#8217;t scale. Instead, you should do a one-to-many model, i.e., fix the problem once and then it&#8217;s shared amongst all your constituents, the same as cloud does, software as a service does.&#8221; So that business slant, business perspective, I think is something that I really enjoy working with a board with, sharing some ideas and then collaborating back and forth. Because again, I think their business acumen is second to none. And if you can simply position cybersecurity as being a business issue, then you can really build a very strong increase of a collaborative environment really quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So speaking of your own uplevelling or upskilling, when did you first recognize that attack surface management was a separate new discipline that you needed to become really familiar with, educate your board on and then help staff it and plan for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: Good question. I think if I look at ASM, or attack surface management, that&#8217;s probably one of the areas that CISOs focus least on and yet is the most important. And the reason for that is, if you look at any hacker, if a hacker wants to compromise your environment, the first thing that they will do is to first get to know your environment. So an example is, if you have a burglar, once they break into a housing estate, she or he will often wander around the housing estate, take a look, which are the houses that have the bins out, which ones have the ground floor windows that are open, which ones have no lights on the front of the house, which one has the dog barking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you wander by. Simply all you&#8217;re doing is a recon. A quick walk by 20 houses in a housing estate. You pick out the two. Now you&#8217;ve got two targets. Then you come back later on in the night or you come back tomorrow evening and then you break into those two. Done. And again, you&#8217;re looking at the way different industries do it. It&#8217;s fascinating because if you look at one industry, i.e., physical security and then you apply cybersecurity or you apply it to the board, oftentimes there&#8217;s a huge amount of similarity. And the same thing with cybersecurity is, if a company wants to compromise your environment, there&#8217;s two ways it will generally happen. One is, they&#8217;re generally doing a network scan and they look at your company and they find you have weak security. And then they turn their head back and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, interesting, a back door is open. I&#8217;m going to focus in on this company.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or else two, same thing as well, they&#8217;re doing a recon but they already know who you are. And in this case, they want to learn as much as possible so they can compromise you deep within your network. So, before you do any hacking of the environment, the recon component is the most critical part. Otherwise, you&#8217;re a bull in a china shop. You&#8217;re rushing in, you&#8217;re knocking off sensors, right, left and center. You shouldn&#8217;t be going in the front door, you should be going in the back door. So the recon component on that is critical, critical, critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you ask most CISOs when was the last time they reconned their own company, the vast majority will say, &#8220;I have no idea whatsoever.&#8221; So they may say, &#8220;Well, we use a security scanner.&#8221; But if you look at a security scanner, what you do is you go to the security scanner, you&#8217;ve put in a set of known IP addresses that you know about and you scan against those IP addresses. But if you look at that, that&#8217;s the tip of the iceberg, because what does the new industry model look like? It&#8217;s fluid. Gone are the days of cybersecurity would stand up a fire wall and it wouldn&#8217;t allow traffic through the firewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everything is extremely dynamic. Everything is internet facing. So now you&#8217;ve got Kubernetes, you&#8217;ve got people spinning up tens of thousands of containers with their own external IP addresses. They&#8217;re all accessible from the internet. You&#8217;ve got dev doing it, stage doing it. You&#8217;ve got all of the different environments coming. And now your attack surface every single minute of every single day changes. Some of it is, because it&#8217;s genuine. You&#8217;re allowing an IP address that&#8217;s out there because there&#8217;s a legitimate business reason, but oftentimes what will happen is, people will spin up the environment and suddenly it&#8217;s exposed to the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does the security team know about it? Likley no, and the CISO has no idea about it. So the ability, whereby you get to know, you get to recon your environment or the ASM, or attack surface management, is absolutely critical. Because if you don&#8217;t know it, you can&#8217;t protect it. And then the issue is, you could spin up an IP address in GCP or AWS or Alibaba. It could be on-prem, everybody&#8217;s now working from home. So my laptop could be exposed from the internet. And if you look at it, what always happens in virtually every single attack, well for the most part from the hosting, it starts on the outside and works its way in. So you really need to know your attack surface. You need to be scanning it every single day. You need to be able to attribute what are the IP addresses and devices that are exposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple example is, if you look at the last number of breaches that occurred, it&#8217;s simple stuff. Most times, it&#8217;s a cluster that was exposed from the internet, or somebody allowed like a transport administration shell like SSH or RDP from the internet, or somebody got a Kubernetes cluster and exposed it from the internet. In each of these cases, it&#8217;s just humans making accidental mistakes. But oftentimes, those IP addresses could be exposed to the internet for minutes, for days, for years, and security never gets to know about it, or protect against it. But at the same time, the hacker knows because they&#8217;re doing their job, they&#8217;re doing the recon continuously. And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m seeing that this issue that&#8217;s been around for years of, “How do I know what&#8217;s exposed to the internet?” now it&#8217;s being defined. It&#8217;s attack surface management. What&#8217;s my outside-in view?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the first time ever cybersecurity are starting to&#8230;they knew there was a problem for ages, but they weren&#8217;t able to articulate what the problem was, never mind what the solution was. And now I&#8217;m seeing the kind of shift that, certainly in the last year or two, people were saying, &#8220;This is not a problem whereby I can look at it and say, yeah, it&#8217;s a problem.&#8221; Now, you&#8217;ve got to shift from this problem idolization to, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve got to go fix this.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s how the hackers are getting in. And now I&#8217;m seeing people saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s start fixing this.&#8221; And I think going forward, you&#8217;re going to have attack surface management be one of the most critical components of any CISO and their organization. If not, then they will get owned. They will get compromised and it will have a devastating impact to their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So speaking of that and how the board understands attack surface management, most IT employees are going to take the path of, like you said, ease and expediency. They&#8217;re spinning up Kubernetes and servers and cloud instances and whatever it may be, because they just need to get the job done. Why is that, when you have a global company, such a problem with, or I should say, an opportunity to solve when you go through other business necessities, like a merger and acquisition, where you may have two companies coming together and you think you know where all the servers are, but in fact, a company grows and changes every single day. And that may not be the last count, the last reliable count. Why is that a concern for CISOs and the board?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Niall</em>: So I think about this as two ways. One is, know the attack surface of your own company. And then, two, for any of your acquisitions, before you acquire them, you need to know what their attack surface is as well. So if you ask 99% of CISOs, &#8220;Tell me about my attack surface.&#8221; They won&#8217;t have the data to do that. So give you an example, in Palo Alto Networks, we use Xpanse. And the way that works is there&#8217;s four main phases I think about in attack surface management. And this applies to whenever you&#8217;re acquiring a company or you&#8217;ve integrated in the last 10 years within your organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first part is, is continuous discovery. So you&#8217;ve got to have the ability—and that&#8217;s why we use Xpanse—to continuously scan 24 by 7 by 365, every single IP address in the internet to work out what IP addresses, what ports are open. So, first of all, you&#8217;ve got to know all of the IP addresses and the ports on the internet. The issue there, that&#8217;s fine, but it&#8217;s not really going to give you much. So what&#8217;s the difference between the IP address in Palo Alto Networks and the IP address of Acme, especially when it changes every single minute? Because everything is dynamic, everything changes continuously on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second part really for us is the attribution. So everything is scanned. We do attribution. So we start looking at every single IP address, every single service, every single user in the internet to look at for those users themselves, are they Palo Alto Networks users or Palo Alto Networks devices or networks? Very critical because that, we&#8217;re able to see at any time, if somebody plugs in a laptop, in London, we&#8217;re able to get attribution that that&#8217;s one of our devices and networks. And if that network and device opens up RDP, a remote shell from the internet, then that&#8217;s an issue. Or if somebody spins up a network that we have no idea what it is, and it&#8217;s got (personally identifiable information) PII or healthcare data, that would be devastating for us for our business. So we spend a lot of time using the tools, such as Xpanse, for the attribution component there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third component we look at, now you know the IP addresses and services and you know which ones are Palo Alto Networks. Next, after that, there&#8217;s varying risk levels. If somebody opens something from the internet that&#8217;s a web server and it&#8217;s communicating using encryption using SSL and it&#8217;s well-patched, then, for the most part, the risk in that case is probably one out of 10. But then, if you&#8217;ve got another IP address that was spun up and it&#8217;s allowing an internal engineering tool that was accidentally exposed to the internet that has access to your cloud environments and it&#8217;s not patched. And oftentimes it&#8217;s not. Because when you look at tools that are exposed accidentally, they&#8217;re not managed because if they were managed in the first place, they wouldn&#8217;t be exposed to the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for us, really, the model is what’s the risk level of every single IP address and every single service? And we can then focus in on the ones that they&#8217;re eight or nine out of 10. On a daily basis or on an hourly basis, we can go fix those. But oftentimes again, it&#8217;s a case of, if they&#8217;re exposed to the internet, they&#8217;re exposed, they&#8217;re not patched, they&#8217;re not managed. They&#8217;re accidentally exposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final one we focus in on, the problem now is, here&#8217;s a problem with scale. You&#8217;re not talking about three IP addresses or four IP addresses. You could be talking about 40,000 IP addresses, 400,000 IP addresses. And then suddenly tomorrow, it&#8217;s 500,000. Then it goes down to 350,009 IP addresses. So, because of the scale of the issue, and because over time more and more things will be internet-facing, the only way to solve this is through automation. No doubt whatsoever that the issue of an alert being generated, and somebody from the security operations center (SOC) jumping in, looking at that IP address, looking at the service, just doesn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what needs to happen is, everything needs to be automated. Everything from the scanning perspective to the attribution components, what&#8217;s the risk of that IP address? So now, instead of you&#8217;ve got 500,000 IP addresses, and now you&#8217;re focusing in on three IP addresses that suddenly popped up there, one is like an SSA server. One could be like a telnet server, another could be an engineering tool. And then, from the automation layer, you want to build automation into the service whereby that service is automatically remediated, whether it&#8217;s patched or whether it&#8217;s taken offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you look at that entire chain, it&#8217;s the reverse of what the hacker is doing. The hacker is, they&#8217;re doing the recon, and then they&#8217;re breaking into that server so as to compromise your environment. You&#8217;re starting the same position as they are, where you should be. You should start with your attack surface, your recon. And after that, then you&#8217;re looking at your risk. You&#8217;re looking at the patching, you&#8217;re looking at taking it offline. You&#8217;re looking at automation. So I firmly believe, if you look at, with the drive towards the cloud, people working from home, this concept of perimeter has been gone for 10 years. It&#8217;s been gone for 10 years. But cybersecurity has been hanging on it and saying, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s still a perimeter.&#8221; There isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now they see every single device that&#8217;s on the internet. That&#8217;s its own perimeter. The device, the network, whatever else it is. And really, I think one of the certainly the driving factors, if everything is on the internet, if everything is online, if everything is always communicating, if everything is dynamically changing, you have to have a cybersecurity program that has the ability to know, tell me every single device that&#8217;s on the network, on the internet, what&#8217;s its risk level? And then for those that hit a certain risk level, either take it offline and apply controls. And by the way, you&#8217;ve got to do it 24 by 7 by 365, no humans involved. You&#8217;ve got to do that because of the scale of the issue. If you have a person that&#8217;s involved as part of that process, then you are going to fail. You are going to fail. Hence us leveraging tools like Xpanse to find and then fix those issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Yeah. Technology is scalable, but humans are not.

The challenge for a chief information security officer (CISO) is talking to the board of directors in a way they can understand and support the company.\nIt’s drilled into the heads of board directors and the C-suite by scary data-breach headlines, lawyers, lawsuits, and risk managers: cybersecurity is high-risk. It’s got to be on the list of a company’s top priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNiall Browne, senior vice president and chief information security officer at Palo Alto Networks, says that you can look at the CISO-board discussion as being a classic sales pitch: successful CISOs will know how to close the deal just like the best salespeople do. “That’s what makes a really good salesperson: the person that has the pitch to close” he says. “They have the ability to close the deal. So they ask for something.”\n“For ages,” Browne says, CISOs have had two big problems with boards. First, they haven’t been able speak the same language so that the board could understand what the issues were. The second problem: “There was no ask.” You can go in front of a board and give your presentation, and the directors can look like they’re in agreement, nodding or shaking their heads, and you can think to yourself, “Job done. They’re updated.” But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the business’s security posture is any better.\nThat’s why it’s important for CISOs to raise the board’s understanding to the level where they know what’s needed and why. Especially when it comes to new advances in cybersecurity, like attack surface management, which is “probably one of the areas that CISOs focus least on and yet is the most important,” Browne says. For example, “many times the CISO and the security team may not be able to see the wood from the trees because they’re so involved in it.” And to do that, CISOs need a set of metrics so that anybody can read a board deck and within minutes understand what the CISO is trying to get across, Browne says. “Because for the most part, the data is there, but there’s no context behind it.”\nThis episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks.\nFull transcript:\nLaurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I’m Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.\nOur topic today is cybersecurity and corporate accountability. In recent years, cybersecurity has become a board level concern with damaged reputation, lost revenue and enormous amounts of data stolen. As the attack surface grows, chief information security officers will have increasing accountability for knowing where to expect the next attack and how to explain how it happened.\nTwo words for you: outside-in visibility.\nMy guest is Niall Browne, who’s the senior vice president and chief information security officer at Palo Alto Networks. Niall has decades of experience in managing global security, compliance and risk management programs for financial institutions, cloud providers and technology services companies. He’s on Google’s CISO advisory board.\nThis episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks.\nWelcome, Niall.\nNiall Browne: Excellent. Thank you, Laurel, for having me.\nLaurel: So as a chief information security officer, or a CISO, you’re responsible for securing both Palo Alto Networks’ products and the company itself. But you’re not securing just any old company; you’re securing a security company that secures other companies. How is that different?\nNiall: Yes, so I think, the beautiful thing about Palo Alto Networks is that we’re the largest cybersecurity company in the world. So we really get to see what an awful lot of companies never get to see. And if you think about it, one of the key things is, knowledge is power. So the more you know about your adversaries, what are they doing, what methods they’re attempting on the network, what are the controls that work and what are the controls that don’t work, the better you are to create your own internal strategy to help protect against those continuous attacks. And you’re in a much better position to be able to provide that data to the board so they can assure that the appropriate oversight is in place.\nSo certainly for us, with that level of knowledge of what we get to see in our networks, that really gives us the opportunity to continuously innovate. So taking our products and continuously building on those, so we can meet the customer requirements and then the industry requirements. So I think that’s probably the first part. The second part is, we’re really in this boat together. So part of my job is continuously talking to individuals in the industry and fellow CISOs, CTOs, CIOs, and CEOs talking about cybersecurity strategy. And invariably, you’ll find the same issues that they’re having are the exact same issues that we’re having. So for us, it’s really the opportunity to share, how do we ensure that we are able to continuously innovate, make a difference in the industry and really collaborate on an ongoing basis with industry leaders. Especially focusing on how we secure our business and provide best practices as to how we companies can be more secure?\nLaurel: So some people may be surprised that collaboration and this kind of open sharing of knowledge is so prevalent, but they shouldn’t be, right? Because how else are you going to all collectively defend against the unknown attackers?\nNiall: Great question. And if you look at it on the opposite side of the fence, hackers are continuously sharing. Albeit they’re sharing for financial gain. In other words, they’ll steal data and they’ll resell it and resell it and resell it and resell it. Hackers are continuously sharing that data, including DIY toolkits. And on the security side of the house, there’s always been historically that legacy suspicion. In other words, I’m the only person who’s having this problem uniquely. And if I share this problem, they’ll think that I’m not doing a good job or the company isn’t doing a good job, or I’m the only person who’s having this specific issue. And what happened over time is, CISOs didn’t share a lot of data, which means the hackers were sharing data right left and center. But on the CISO side of the house, on the protection side, there was very little collaboration, which meant that now you had limited shared industry best practices.\nEach CISO was in their own silo, in their own pillar, doing their own unique thing, and everybody was learning from their own mistakes. So it was really a one-to-one model. You make a mistake and then you make another mistake, and then you make another mistake. However, if you could talk to your peer, imagine in business or finance, you’re continuously talking to the CTO and the CFO to say, “Oh, by the way, how did you manage such and such issue?” So I’m now seeing the industry starting to change. CISOs are now starting to change, and share. They’re continuously talking about strategy. They’re continually talking about how do they protect their environment? They’re talking about, what are some of the good business models that work?\nAnd if you look at MIT, there’s industry and technical and business models that really work in other industries. But then, if you look in the CISO community itself, it’s like, what are those industry best practices? And now they’re only starting to get kind of formulated up, bubble up from there. And what I’m seeing, certainly over the last, I would say three or four years, there’s a tremendous growth on the CISOs in relation to learning industry best practices, and really uplevelling their skillset. So they’re just not that technical geek in the corner. They really need to be able to talk business technology, be able to talk business terms, and really be able to be seen as that close peer to that CTO, to the CIO, to the CEO in relation to solving business problems.\nBecause if you think about it from a cybersecurity perspective, at the end of the day, it’s just a business problem. And if it’s a business problem, you need to apply strategic business solutions to solving those issues. Instead of talking about what version of antivirus you’re on, you really need to uplevel the conversation, so that, when you speak to the board, when you’re speaking to the same C-level executive, they’re not throwing their eyes in the air. They understand that you’re talking the same business language as them. Which means, again, if you’re a trusted business partner, then you can make a huge amount more difference in the company, as opposed to being seen as that junior IT leader in the organization that somebody only ever comes to if we get hacked or if a backup fails, or if a Mac is broken.\nLaurel: I really like that analogy…growth of the position itself. Like you said, it does actually elevate this role to the board table because it is a business problem with a possible business solution. But how can boards then in return make better decisions? You will then also have to bring some data and information and something to help the board along with all of the other decisions they have to make across the entire company.\nNiall: And that’s the key thing, is that most people, when they look at it, it’s classic sales. You can have the best salesperson in the business, but unless they have the close, and the close is the ask. Here’s a great product, and I want to sell this product, i.e., this car for, let’s say, $50,000. And then at the end of the sales pitch, will you buy the car? And that’s what makes a really good salesperson, the person that has the pitch to close. They have the ability to close the deal. So they ask for something. So I think for ages, CISOs had two big issues with the board. One is, they weren’t able to report the right data up to the board and speak the same language where the board would be able to understand what the issues were.\nAnd then two, there was no ask. And that’s very important because if you go into a board and you present and everybody’s nodding and shaking their head and understanding it, sure you’ve updated them, but the security posture is none the better. And if you look at a classical board, any board itself, they’re there at a very, very high level, obviously, to serve the company. So any of the board members or any of the boards that I’ve worked with in the past, they have been extremely willing to help the business itself. So they’re always looking at, “Well, you presented X, but now, how can I help?” So I think CISOs need to flip it into more of being that salesperson with the close. Most importantly, what’s my ask?\nAnd a classic board meeting, I think that goes well, is, you sit down, you work with the board, you show a core set of metrics. Now, you don’t want to show metrics on numbers that are absolutely meaningless to the board. If you look at the board, the board has a wide range of skill sets. Some board members may be compliance experts, some may be business leaders, some may be finance leaders. So it’s really about when you communicate with the board, two sets of things. One is coming up with a set of communications or metrics, and really outlining the business case so that anybody can read a board deck, and within minutes they understand what you’re trying to get across. That’s critical.\nAnd then a second part is, it’s not a presentation. Every board meeting should end with time at the end for questions and answers and for the ask. And I would say, a good board meeting is whereby you don’t even go through the deck. You share the deck in advance, they’ve read through it, they were able to understand your cybersecurity posture by just looking at your deck. And then the board meeting doesn’t even refer to the deck. It’s a simple set of questions, comments back and forth and then the ask. And the ask could be, “Listen, can we get some more focus on a certain area itself or more resources?” Or they may have an ask of you as well. So again, I think the model really is, communicate a core set of data and then making it a conversation with a collaborative ask from both sides versus coming up with a 30-slide deck that nobody understands that you present it and then you run out of the board meeting from there. That model just doesn’t work, as we know.\nLaurel: Yeah. Not for anyone, right? So what specific metrics do you actually report back to the board and why are those metrics important to your board or any other board?\nNiall: The issue with any industry, including cybersecurity is, sometimes there’s just too much data. So, if you look at industry standards like ISO 27001, you may have a hundred and something controls. If you look at FedRAMP, you’ve got 300 something controls. If you look at COSO or COBIT. So you don’t want to go to the board with, “By the way, here’s 2,000 controls. And here’s how we’re in compliance with these 2,000 controls.” Because for the most part, the data is there, but there’s no context behind it. So they’re wondering, like, “AV being on 95% of end points, is that good? We scan once every, let’s say 12 hours, is that good?” So they’re what I call meaningless metrics. They have no benefit whatsoever for most InfoSec people, never mind board-level leaders. So from our point of view, we break it into simple core sets of pillars that we can measure over time.\nAnd generally, you don’t want to have a set of pillars that’s 25 pillars, because that’s too many because you’re not able to measure one versus 25. So internally, we generally settle in about five major core areas that we focus in on and we measure against those each time. So one is, secure our products. Most organizations are very, very product-centric now. So products in most companies are becoming critical, critical, critical. So one thing we measure is how are we measuring? How are we protecting our products? And we rate ourselves on a scale of zero up to five being maximum maturity.\nNow, if you have really good products, but they’re sitting on infrastructure that’s insecure, you have an issue. So the second one is, secure our infrastructure. And the third one is detection and response. So that if you’ve got really secure products on really secure infrastructure, but nobody’s looking at it and nobody’s measuring or monitoring the environment for attacks, then you have an issue. So for us, it’s detection response is the third one, which is critical.\nThe fourth one then is people. And the people component, it’s absolutely…I can’t stress this enough because if you don’t have people that understand cybersecurity, then you’ve got a core issue. The vast majority of times, it’s people that do something in a company accidentally, i.e., they may click on a phishing link that compromises your network. So one thing, what we call it is street smart. So one of the four pillars is, can we get people so they’re street smart? In other words, cybersecurity smart, street smart. So if they’re walking down the road and they see a stranger look suspicious, well use your gut. Same thing with cybersecurity. What are the simple things that they should do or think about on a day-to-day basis that they can protect a company?\nAnd then the fifth one really is governance. How do we do governance and how do we manage ourselves? And how do we measure our success? So if you look at it there, it’s five simple pillars. It’s just simply product, infrastructure, detection response, people, and governance. And we measure zero to five for each of those. So then it’s very easy for the board and for other members to look at, How are we trending against those areas over time? It allows you to go high, in other words, the thousand-foot view. And then if there’s a question of infrastructure, you can look at the measurement, the infrastructure pillar, and then you can start jumping into other metrics later if they want. But really, that’s the way we articulate that, how we built our security program. And that’s something that I think that resonates very strongly with the board, because now they’re able to measure us based on known entities versus meaningless metrics that for the most part tell them nothing.\nLaurel: Now, what if we switched that though? What kind of responsibility does the board have to be “street smart” and have some kind of foundational understanding of cybersecurity? Or do you take that on as your own personal responsibility to spend time with each member to make sure they understand the foundations?\nNiall: Correct. So for us, it’s very much a case of taking a certain level of knowledge and then building on that knowledge so at least everybody’s on the same level of knowledge. So one example is, again, you could have somebody who’s chairing that audit committee, who’s very, very technical or very, very compliance driven. And she or he may know all about boards…audits and all the frameworks. And that’s great. And then the other side, you might have somebody who’s more finance-based or more audit-based. And then the question is, how do you work on uplevelling everybody’s skillset?\nAnd there’s numerous different ways of doing that. It’s two things. One is sitting down with them one-on-one and then providing an uplevel of conversation on, this is what we’re doing. This is our entire security program. This is how it works. This is what 2020 looked like. This is what 2021 looks like…so getting everybody onto the same level and building that relationship is very, very important.\nAnd we continuously see that whereby our board members will reach out towards us or we’ll reach out to them in sharing data, or they’ll have an idea that we haven’t thought about and we’ll say, “Well, that’s a really good idea. Let’s incorporate that into our program.” So I think that’s very useful. And then the second part is, it’s all about telling a story. So a story and a narrative. So if you open up a book and you start at the security side and you start at the end chapter, well, that’s not very compelling. It’s like, who’s Jane? Who’s Judy? Who’s Tim? Who’s Tony? Doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.\nAnd oftentimes, that’s what happens in cybersecurity reports is that the board is looking at…and here’s she or he that’s presenting as a CISO and they’re presenting a set of data and metrics that they don’t understand and so therefore, they can’t do anything with that. So we spend a lot of time, our first board, starting off with a basic set of principles and then each board after that, every three months or so we go into more detail incrementally, as we’re growing and as we’re building that cybersecurity deck, they get to better understand and uplevel their understanding as well. And then from their side, with that level of understanding, they can very easily jump in and say, “Oh, by the way, here’s an area I think you should be focusing in on.”\nAnd on our board, we have some VC firms, obviously, that are highly technical and they’ll have a slant that they’ll want us to focus in on. I want to say, “Sure, let’s incorporate that as part of our program.” So I think I would see this as board communication as a very much back and forth communication. It shouldn’t happen once a quarter. It should not happen on a daily basis, but certainly it should happen throughout the quarter whereby a board member has an idea and then you can incorporate that as part of your best practices.\nNow, at the same time, you want the staff within that company to be able to operationally run their security team. But certainly, the insights some board member can provide, in some cases are tremendously because they’ve been in that industry for numerous different years. And as part of that model, they would typically have seen what other individuals have never seen before. Plus, I think what’s mostly beneficial from there, in cybersecurity, cybersecurity, again, it’s a business problem and it’s a business process. So most of these board members are exceptional at solving business practices. Maybe not cybersecurity, but they can take a cybersecurity issue and they can relate that to another business best practices, and then leverage that one in cybersecurity.\nAnd frankly, I think that’s the best value a board can provide. Many times the CISO and the security team may not be able to see the wood from the trees because they’re so involved in it. For the board members, it’s a great kind of prism whereby they can look at it from the outside in, and they can provide insight based on, “Well, hang on a second, the way you’re solving this issue based in cybersecurity by doing a consulting model, that doesn’t work or that doesn’t scale. Instead, you should do a one-to-many model, i.e., fix the problem once and then it’s shared amongst all your constituents, the same as cloud does, software as a service does.” So that business slant, business perspective, I think is something that I really enjoy working with a board with, sharing some ideas and then collaborating back and forth. Because again, I think their business acumen is second to none. And if you can simply position cybersecurity as being a business issue, then you can really build a very strong increase of a collaborative environment really quickly.\nLaurel: So speaking of your own uplevelling or upskilling, when did you first recognize that attack surface management was a separate new discipline that you needed to become really familiar with, educate your board on and then help staff it and plan for it?\nNiall: Good question. I think if I look at ASM, or attack surface management, that’s probably one of the areas that CISOs focus least on and yet is the most important. And the reason for that is, if you look at any hacker, if a hacker wants to compromise your environment, the first thing that they will do is to first get to know your environment. So an example is, if you have a burglar, once they break into a housing estate, she or he will often wander around the housing estate, take a look, which are the houses that have the bins out, which ones have the ground floor windows that are open, which ones have no lights on the front of the house, which one has the dog barking?\nSo you wander by. Simply all you’re doing is a recon. A quick walk by 20 houses in a housing estate. You pick out the two. Now you’ve got two targets. Then you come back later on in the night or you come back tomorrow evening and then you break into those two. Done. And again, you’re looking at the way different industries do it. It’s fascinating because if you look at one industry, i.e., physical security and then you apply cybersecurity or you apply it to the board, oftentimes there’s a huge amount of similarity. And the same thing with cybersecurity is, if a company wants to compromise your environment, there’s two ways it will generally happen. One is, they’re generally doing a network scan and they look at your company and they find you have weak security. And then they turn their head back and they’re like, “Oh, interesting, a back door is open. I’m going to focus in on this company.”\nOr else two, same thing as well, they’re doing a recon but they already know who you are. And in this case, they want to learn as much as possible so they can compromise you deep within your network. So, before you do any hacking of the environment, the recon component is the most critical part. Otherwise, you’re a bull in a china shop. You’re rushing in, you’re knocking off sensors, right, left and center. You shouldn’t be going in the front door, you should be going in the back door. So the recon component on that is critical, critical, critical.\nNow, if you ask most CISOs when was the last time they reconned their own company, the vast majority will say, “I have no idea whatsoever.” So they may say, “Well, we use a security scanner.” But if you look at a security scanner, what you do is you go to the security scanner, you’ve put in a set of known IP addresses that you know about and you scan against those IP addresses. But if you look at that, that’s the tip of the iceberg, because what does the new industry model look like? It’s fluid. Gone are the days of cybersecurity would stand up a fire wall and it wouldn’t allow traffic through the firewall.\nNow everything is extremely dynamic. Everything is internet facing. So now you’ve got Kubernetes, you’ve got people spinning up tens of thousands of containers with their own external IP addresses. They’re all accessible from the internet. You’ve got dev doing it, stage doing it. You’ve got all of the different environments coming. And now your attack surface every single minute of every single day changes. Some of it is, because it’s genuine. You’re allowing an IP address that’s out there because there’s a legitimate business reason, but oftentimes what will happen is, people will spin up the environment and suddenly it’s exposed to the internet.\nDoes the security team know about it? Likley no, and the CISO has no idea about it. So the ability, whereby you get to know, you get to recon your environment or the ASM, or attack surface management, is absolutely critical. Because if you don’t know it, you can’t protect it. And then the issue is, you could spin up an IP address in GCP or AWS or Alibaba. It could be on-prem, everybody’s now working from home. So my laptop could be exposed from the internet. And if you look at it, what always happens in virtually every single attack, well for the most part from the hosting, it starts on the outside and works its way in. So you really need to know your attack surface. You need to be scanning it every single day. You need to be able to attribute what are the IP addresses and devices that are exposed.\nSimple example is, if you look at the last number of breaches that occurred, it’s simple stuff. Most times, it’s a cluster that was exposed from the internet, or somebody allowed like a transport administration shell like SSH or RDP from the internet, or somebody got a Kubernetes cluster and exposed it from the internet. In each of these cases, it’s just humans making accidental mistakes. But oftentimes, those IP addresses could be exposed to the internet for minutes, for days, for years, and security never gets to know about it, or protect against it. But at the same time, the hacker knows because they’re doing their job, they’re doing the recon continuously. And that’s where I’m seeing that this issue that’s been around for years of, “How do I know what’s exposed to the internet?” now it’s being defined. It’s attack surface management. What’s my outside-in view?\nSo for the first time ever cybersecurity are starting to…they knew there was a problem for ages, but they weren’t able to articulate what the problem was, never mind what the solution was. And now I’m seeing the kind of shift that, certainly in the last year or two, people were saying, “This is not a problem whereby I can look at it and say, yeah, it’s a problem.” Now, you’ve got to shift from this problem idolization to, “Hey, we’ve got to go fix this.” Because that’s how the hackers are getting in. And now I’m seeing people saying, “Let’s start fixing this.” And I think going forward, you’re going to have attack surface management be one of the most critical components of any CISO and their organization. If not, then they will get owned. They will get compromised and it will have a devastating impact to their business.\nLaurel: So speaking of that and how the board understands attack surface management, most IT employees are going to take the path of, like you said, ease and expediency. They’re spinning up Kubernetes and servers and cloud instances and whatever it may be, because they just need to get the job done. Why is that, when you have a global company, such a problem with, or I should say, an opportunity to solve when you go through other business necessities, like a merger and acquisition, where you may have two companies coming together and you think you know where all the servers are, but in fact, a company grows and changes every single day. And that may not be the last count, the last reliable count. Why is that a concern for CISOs and the board?\nNiall: So I think about this as two ways. One is, know the attack surface of your own company. And then, two, for any of your acquisitions, before you acquire them, you need to know what their attack surface is as well. So if you ask 99% of CISOs, “Tell me about my attack surface.” They won’t have the data to do that. So give you an example, in Palo Alto Networks, we use Xpanse. And the way that works is there’s four main phases I think about in attack surface management. And this applies to whenever you’re acquiring a company or you’ve integrated in the last 10 years within your organization.\nAnd the first part is, is continuous discovery. So you’ve got to have the ability—and that’s why we use Xpanse—to continuously scan 24 by 7 by 365, every single IP address in the internet to work out what IP addresses, what ports are open. So, first of all, you’ve got to know all of the IP addresses and the ports on the internet. The issue there, that’s fine, but it’s not really going to give you much. So what’s the difference between the IP address in Palo Alto Networks and the IP address of Acme, especially when it changes every single minute? Because everything is dynamic, everything changes continuously on the internet.\nSo the second part really for us is the attribution. So everything is scanned. We do attribution. So we start looking at every single IP address, every single service, every single user in the internet to look at for those users themselves, are they Palo Alto Networks users or Palo Alto Networks devices or networks? Very critical because that, we’re able to see at any time, if somebody plugs in a laptop, in London, we’re able to get attribution that that’s one of our devices and networks. And if that network and device opens up RDP, a remote shell from the internet, then that’s an issue. Or if somebody spins up a network that we have no idea what it is, and it’s got (personally identifiable information) PII or healthcare data, that would be devastating for us for our business. So we spend a lot of time using the tools, such as Xpanse, for the attribution component there.\nThird component we look at, now you know the IP addresses and services and you know which ones are Palo Alto Networks. Next, after that, there’s varying risk levels. If somebody opens something from the internet that’s a web server and it’s communicating using encryption using SSL and it’s well-patched, then, for the most part, the risk in that case is probably one out of 10. But then, if you’ve got another IP address that was spun up and it’s allowing an internal engineering tool that was accidentally exposed to the internet that has access to your cloud environments and it’s not patched. And oftentimes it’s not. Because when you look at tools that are exposed accidentally, they’re not managed because if they were managed in the first place, they wouldn’t be exposed to the internet.\nSo for us, really, the model is what’s the risk level of every single IP address and every single service? And we can then focus in on the ones that they’re eight or nine out of 10. On a daily basis or on an hourly basis, we can go fix those. But oftentimes again, it’s a case of, if they’re exposed to the internet, they’re exposed, they’re not patched, they’re not managed. They’re accidentally exposed.\nAnd then the final one we focus in on, the problem now is, here’s a problem with scale. You’re not talking about three IP addresses or four IP addresses. You could be talking about 40,000 IP addresses, 400,000 IP addresses. And then suddenly tomorrow, it’s 500,000. Then it goes down to 350,009 IP addresses. So, because of the scale of the issue, and because over time more and more things will be internet-facing, the only way to solve this is through automation. No doubt whatsoever that the issue of an alert being generated, and somebody from the security operations center (SOC) jumping in, looking at that IP address, looking at the service, just doesn’t work.\nSo what needs to happen is, everything needs to be automated. Everything from the scanning perspective to the attribution components, what’s the risk of that IP address? So now, instead of you’ve got 500,000 IP addresses, and now you’re focusing in on three IP addresses that suddenly popped up there, one is like an SSA server. One could be like a telnet server, another could be an engineering tool. And then, from the automation layer, you want to build automation into the service whereby that service is automatically remediated, whether it’s patched or whether it’s taken offline.\nAnd if you look at that entire chain, it’s the reverse of what the hacker is doing. The hacker is, they’re doing the recon, and then they’re breaking into that server so as to compromise your environment. You’re starting the same position as they are, where you should be. You should start with your attack surface, your recon. And after that, then you’re looking at your risk. You’re looking at the patching, you’re looking at taking it offline. You’re looking at automation. So I firmly believe, if you look at, with the drive towards the cloud, people working from home, this concept of perimeter has been gone for 10 years. It’s been gone for 10 years. But cybersecurity has been hanging on it and saying, “Well, there’s still a perimeter.” There isn’t.\nSo now they see every single device that’s on the internet. That’s its own perimeter. The device, the network, whatever else it is. And really, I think one of the certainly the driving factors, if everything is on the internet, if everything is online, if everything is always communicating, if everything is dynamically changing, you have to have a cybersecurity program that has the ability to know, tell me every single device that’s on the network, on the internet, what’s its risk level? And then for those that hit a certain risk level, either take it offline and apply controls. And by the way, you’ve got to do it 24 by 7 by 365, no humans involved. You’ve got to do that because of the scale of the issue. If you have a person that’s involved as part of that process, then you are going to fail. You are going to fail. Hence us leveraging tools like Xpanse to find and then fix those issues.\nLaurel: Yeah. Technology is scalable, but humans are not.

It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog\" title=\"The Product Backlog According to the Scrum Guide—Age-of-Product.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Scrum is about figuring out what is worth building to improve your customers&#8217; lives while mitigating risk in a complex environment. Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that purpose, you want an actionable Product Backlog that reflects the best use of the developers’ time at any given moment. To achieve that level of fitness, your Product Backlog needs to be trimmed. Remember: The Product Backlog is about product delivery, not product discovery. So, handle the latter somewhere else to avoid cluttering the Backlog itself.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Oversized Product Backlogs</h2> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>The symptom</strong>: The Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Garbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being “busy” ≠ providing value to customers &#038; the organization. </li>\r\n\t<li>The Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The solution</strong>: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/oversized-product-backlog-making-your-scrum-work-11/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpet3ZRyTx34%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The XXL Product Backlog Problem — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An oversized Product Backlog looks good at first glance only to reveal at the second that your organization seems to value output over the outcome. However, creating a humongous backlog of tasks and keeping the “resources” constantly busy will not create value for your customers. On the contrary, clinging to the old industrial paradigm thinking while practicing Scrum will inevitably lead to bad production decisions. Thus, having an oversized Product Backlog will reduce the organization’s return on investment while we could serve our customers better at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your organization also prone to fall for the oversized Product Backlog, thus impeding Scrum?

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. Neglecting the critical Scrum artifact for continuous value creation is one of the common Scrum anti-patterns. If your Scrum Team strives to make your customers’ lives easier Sprint after Sprint, beware of the oversized Product Backlog.\n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of inadequate Product Backlog management in less than three minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more us on July 6, 2021, for the Hands-on Agile #32: How to Win with Agile Resistant Teams—Scott Weiner.\n\r\n\r\nThe Product Backlog According to the Scrum Guide\n\r\n\r\n\nThe Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.\n\r\n\r\nProduct Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.\n\r\n\r\nThe Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScrum is about figuring out what is worth building to improve your customers’ lives while mitigating risk in a complex environment. Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. \n\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, you want an actionable Product Backlog that reflects the best use of the developers’ time at any given moment. To achieve that level of fitness, your Product Backlog needs to be trimmed. Remember: The Product Backlog is about product delivery, not product discovery. So, handle the latter somewhere else to avoid cluttering the Backlog itself.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOversized Product Backlogs\n \r\n\r\nThe symptom: The Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nGarbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being “busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nThe XXL Product Backlog Problem — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nAn oversized Product Backlog looks good at first glance only to reveal at the second that your organization seems to value output over the outcome. However, creating a humongous backlog of tasks and keeping the “resources” constantly busy will not create value for your customers. On the contrary, clinging to the old industrial paradigm thinking while practicing Scrum will inevitably lead to bad production decisions. Thus, having an oversized Product Backlog will reduce the organization’s return on investment while we could serve our customers better at the same time.\n\r\n\r\nIs your organization also prone to fall for the oversized Product Backlog, thus impeding Scrum?

The certificate is now being accepted in Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Poland. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How it works: </strong>The certificate comes in the form of a QR code, which can be  either stored on a cell phone or printed out on paper.

It’s a messy journey, with an evolving personalization strategy propelled by Netflix’s ability to execute high-cadence experiments using its home-grown A/B test system.</p><p>In twenty years, Netflix has gone from members choosing 2% of the movies the merchandising system suggests to 80% today. In the early days, a member would explore hundreds of titles before finding something they liked. Today most members look at forty choices before they hit the “play” button. Twenty years from now, Netflix hopes to play that one choice that’s “just right” for you with no browsing or choice required.</p><p>Here’s one minute of reading for each year of Netflix’s twenty-year history! I hope you enjoy it.</p><h4>1998: A DVD-By-Mail Startup Is Born</h4><p>Netflix began as a DVD-by-mail startup, following the invention of the DVD player in 1996. In 1998 Netflix launched its website with less than 1,000 DVDs. Here’s what the site looked like its first few years:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*LAiPqUgYqbf87WDu.png\" /><figcaption>Netflix in 1999 had 2,600 DVDs to choose from. The service was a la carte. Netflix didn’t become an “all you can eat” subscription service until 2000.</figcaption></figure><p>In 1999, Netflix had 2,600 DVDs to choose from but intended to grow its library to 100,000 titles. To make it easier for members to find movies, Netflix developed a personalized merchandising system.</p><p>In 2000, when Netflix transitioned from an a la carte business to an all-you-can-eat subscription service, the service added a queue, a list of movies each household created by hitting the “Add” button to add a title to an ordered list of movies. Each time a member returned a DVD, Netflix would send the title at the top of each member’s Netflix Queue directly to their mailbox.</p><h4>2000: Cinematch</h4><p>Netflix introduced a personalized movie recommendation system, using member ratings to predict how much a member would like a movie. The algorithm was called Cinematch, and it’s a collaborative filtering algorithm.</p><p>Here’s an easy way to understand collaborative filtering. Imagine I like “Batman Begins” and “Breaking Bad,” and you like both, too. Because I like “Casino,” the algorithm suggests you’ll like “Casino.” Now, apply this approach across millions of members and titles.</p><h4>2001: The Five-Star Rating System</h4><p>Netflix created a five-star rating system and eventually collected billions of ratings from its members. Netflix experimented with multiple “star bars,” at times stacking the stars to indicate expected rating, average rating, and friends’ rating. It was a mess.</p><p>The stars represented how much a member would like a movie. If a member had watched the movie already, they could rate it.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Zfv400Pi3L1F7EEv.png\" /><figcaption>The red stars indicate the expected rating for a member, although most assumed It was the average rating.</figcaption></figure><h4>2002: Multiple Algorithms</h4><p>Beyond Cinematch, three other algorithms worked together to help merchandise movies:</p><ol><li><strong>Dynamic store.</strong> This algorithm indicated if the DVD was available. Late in the DVD era, the algorithm even determined if a DVD was available in a member’s local hub. By 2008, Netflix only merchandised locally available titles to increase the likelihood of next-day DVD delivery.</li><li><strong>Metasims.</strong> This algorithm incorporated all movie data available for each title — plot synopsis, director, actors, year, awards, language, etc.</li><li><strong>Search.</strong> In the early days, there was little investment in search as the team assumed members searched for expensive new release DVDs, making the company’s economics more challenging. But the team discovered that the titles members chose included lots of older, less expensive, long-tail titles, so they eventually ramped up investment in search.</li></ol><p>In time, Netflix blended lots of other algorithms to execute its personalized merchandising system.</p><h4>2004: Profiles</h4><p>Recognizing multiple family members used a shared account, Netflix launched “Profiles.” This feature enabled each family member to generate its own movie list. Profiles were a highly requested feature, but only two percent of members used it despite aggressive promotion. It was a lot of work to manage an ordered list of DVDs, and only one person in each household was willing to do this.</p><p>Given the low adoption, Netflix announced its plan to kill Profiles but capitulated in the face of member backlash. A small set of users cared deeply about the feature — they were afraid that losing Profiles would ruin their marriages. As an example of “all members are not created equal,” half the Netflix board used the feature.</p><h4>2004: Netflix Launches “Friends.”</h4><p>The hypothesis: if you create a network of friends within Netflix, they’ll suggest great movie ideas to each other and won’t quit the service because they don’t want to leave their friends. At launch, 2% of Netflix members connected with at least one friend, but this metric never moved beyond 5%.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*FjmhXp3cGaONkzWm.png\" /><figcaption>Friends let you connect with friends on the service, then see what they watched and what they recommended to you.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix killed the feature in 2010 as part of its discipline of “scraping the barnacles” — removing features that members didn’t value. Unlike Profiles, there was no user revolt.</p><p>Two insights on social in the context of movies:</p><ol><li>Your friends have bad taste</li><li>You don’t want your friends to know all the movies you’re watching.</li></ol><p>These are surprising insights during a decade when Facebook successfully applied its social strategy to many product categories.</p><h4>2006: The Netflix Personalization Strategy</h4><p>Here’s what the personalization strategy looked like in 2006. It’s organized in the Strategy/Metrics/Tactics format, with a proxy metric for each strategy, as well as tactics (projects) against each strategy:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*T4l48_tyhUnDGr42.png\" /></figure><p>The intent was to gather explicit and implicit data, then use various algorithms and presentation tactics to connect members with movies they’d love. The team focused on four main strategies:</p><ol><li><strong>Gather explicit taste data,</strong> including movie and TV show ratings, genre ratings, and demographic data.</li><li><strong>Explore</strong> <strong>implicit taste data</strong> like DVDs members added to their movie list or later, which movies members streamed.</li><li><strong>Create algorithms and presentation layer tactics to connect members with movies they’ll love</strong>. This strategy focused on using the explicit/implicit taste data, along with lots of data about movies and TV shows (ratings, genres, synopsis, lead actors, directors, etc.), to create algorithms that connected members with titles. The expectation was that Netflix would also create a simple user interface that provided visual support for personalized choices.</li><li><strong>Improve average movie ratings for each member</strong> by connecting them with better movies and TV shows. The assumption was that if Netflix connected its members with higher quality movies and TV shows, they would retain better.</li></ol><p>The high-level hypothesis: personalization would improve retention by making it easy for members to find movies they’ll love.</p><p>The high-level engagement metric was retention. It takes years to affect this metric, however. So Netflix had a more sensitive, short-term proxy metric: The percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies during their first two months with the service.</p><p>The theory was that members would rate lots of movies to get better recommendations. These ratings signaled that members appreciated the personalized recommendations they received in return for their ratings. More ratings were a signal that members appreciated Netflix’s personalized merchandising algorithms.</p><p>Here’s a very rough snapshot of the improvement in this proxy metric over time:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2XrxGR-PVVKb1J8i.png\" /><figcaption>The early proxy metric for Netflix’s personalization efforts was the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies or TV shows during their first two months with the service.</figcaption></figure><p>Why the 2011 dip in the metric? By this time, most members streamed movies, and Netflix had a strong implicit signal about member taste. Once you hit the “Play” button, you either kept watching or stopped. Netflix no longer needed to collect as many star ratings.</p><p>It took Netflix more than a decade to demonstrate that a personalized experience improved retention. But consistent growth in this proxy metric convinced the company to keep doubling down on personalization.</p><h4>2006: The Ratings Wizard</h4><p>The original petri dish for personalization was an area on the site with a “Recommendations” tab. But testing revealed that members preferred less prescriptive language. The new tab had a “Movies You’ll Heart” tab that generated lots of clicks. The design team thought the tab was “fugly,” but it worked.</p><p>When members arrived at the “Movies You’ll Heart” area, the site introduced them to the “Ratings Wizard”:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kZZ43K5lcu-Pu9yZ.png\" /></figure><p>Members “binge-rated” while they waited for their DVDs to arrive. The Ratings Wizard was critical in moving the “percentage of members who rate at least 50 movies in their first two months” proxy metric. While members rated lots of movies using the “star bar” throughout the site, the Ratings Wizard was the major source of taste input.</p><h4>2006: Demographic Data</h4><p>Netflix collected age and gender data from its members, but when the team used demographics to inform predictions about a member’s movie taste, the algorithms did not improve predictive power. Huh?</p><p>How did Netflix measure predictive power? The proxy metric for the personalization algorithms was RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) — a calculation that measures the delta between the algorithm’s predicted rating and a member’s actual rating. If Netflix predicted you would like “Friends” and “Seinfeld” four and five stars respectively, and you rated these shows four and five stars, the prediction was perfect. RMSE is a “down and to the right” metric that improved over time, mainly through improvements in the collaborative filtering algorithm. You can see the improvements in the rough graph below:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AkUtLLdi5Q49HCIf.png\" /><figcaption>Root Mean Square Error is a calculation of the predicted v. actual ratings for all Netflix members. It’s a “down and to the right” metric that got better over time.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, age and gender data did not improve predictions — there was no improvement in RMSE. Movie tastes are hard to predict as they are idiosyncratic — they are very peculiar and vary radically from one individual to another. Knowing my age and gender doesn’t help predict my movie tastes. It’s much more helpful to know just a few movies or TV shows I like.</p><p>To see this insight in action today, create a new profile on your Netflix account. Netflix asks for a few titles you like to kickstart the personalization system. That’s all they need to seed the system.</p><h4>2006: Collaborative Filtering in the QUACL</h4><p>The QUACL is the Queue Add Confirmation Layer. Once a member added a title to their Queue, a confirmation layer would pop up suggesting similar titles. Below, a member has added “Eiken” to their movie list, and the collaborative filtering algorithm suggests six similar titles:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/670/0*ELh-Ov_TEeuZhnH6.png\" /><figcaption>The QUACL — the Queue Add Confirmation Layer — was a significant source of personalized merchandising.</figcaption></figure><p>Over time, Netflix got better at suggesting similar titles for members to add to their queue. This drove the QUACL as a merchandising source from ten to fifteen percent of total queue adds over a few years. The QUACL was a great test environment for algorithm testing. In fact, Netflix executed some of its first machine learning tests within the QUACL.</p><h4>2006: The $1M Netflix Prize</h4><p>Like any startup, Netflix had limited resources. They had proven the value of “Cinematch” but had only one engineer focused on the algorithm. The solution: outsource algorithm development via The Netflix Prize.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/0*UkjjhZLG1pOEw1Y6.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Netflix offered $1 Million to any team that could improve RMSE by at least 10%.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix offered a million-dollar prize to any team that improved RMSE for their Cinematch algorithm by ten percent. The personalization team provided anonymized data from Netflix members as training data for the teams, along with a second dataset that included members’ actual ratings so teams could test their algorithms’ predictive power. It took two years for teams to win the money — more on that in a moment.</p><h4>2007: Netflix Streaming Launch</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Rbn7iUWPbxC6jjkh.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Netflix launched streaming in 2007. It was a free add-on for the DVD-by-mail service. The first streaming-only offering launched in Canada in 2010.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix launched streaming in January 2007. For the first time, the Netflix team had real-time data about what movies members watched, where before, they only had DVD rental activity. Over time, this implicit data became more important in predicting members’ movie tastes than the explicit data Netflix collected via its five-star rating system.</p><p>At the time of streaming launch in 2007, Netflix had nearly 100,000 DVDs to choose from, so the DVD merchandising challenge was to help members find “hidden gems” from its huge DVD library. However, with streaming, the challenge was to help members identify a few movies they’d find worthwhile among the three hundred fairly mediocre titles available at launch.</p><h4>2007: Netflix Prize</h4><p>The “Netflix Prize” offered $1 million to any team that could improve the predictive power of Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm by 10%, as measured by RMSE, the delta between expected and actual rating for each movie. Two years later, “Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos” won the contest, beating 5,000 other teams.</p><p>There were two insights from the contest:</p><ul><li><strong>All ratings are not created equal.</strong> Contestants discovered that the ratings members provided for recent movies provided more predictive power than older ratings.</li><li><strong>The more algorithms, the better.</strong> At the end of each year, Netflix paid a $50,000 progress prize to the leading team. On the final day of the year, the teams in second and third place combined their algorithms and vaulted to the top of the leaderboard to take the annual progress prize. That’s how teams learned the importance of combining lots of algorithms. That’s also why the team names were so strange — when teams combined their work, they created “mashup” names.</li></ul><p>After two years, the top team delivered a 10.06% increase in RMSE to win the million-dollar prize. “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” submitted its winning algorithm twenty-four minutes before the second-place team, “The Ensemble.” The two teams had identical scores, but “BellKor” submitted their entry first. Here’s the final leaderboard:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EyFRinwD-IY0rv9S.png\" /><figcaption>The leaderboard for the Netflix Prize at its conclusion in 2009. The fourth-place team, “Opera Solutions and Vandelay United,” was the combined submission of three teams and included an insider joke from “Seinfeld.”</figcaption></figure><h4>2009: The Next Big Netflix Prize</h4><p>When Netflix announced the winners of its first competition, it launched a second round. The new challenge was to use demographics and rental behavior to make better predictions. The algorithms could consider a member’s age, gender, ZIP code, and full rental history.</p><p>When Netflix released anonymized customer information to start the second round, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in with a lawsuit arguing that the data wasn’t sufficiently anonymized. As part of the March 2010 settlement for that suit, Netflix canceled the second round.</p><h4>2010: Testing the New “Netflix Prize” Algorithm</h4><p>Netflix launched the Netflix Prize contest to provide better movie choices for members, which the team hoped would translate into retention improvement. But when Netflix executed the new algorithm in a large-scale A/B test, there was no measurable retention difference. It was a disappointing result.</p><p>A new hypothesis emerged. To improve retention, you needed better algorithms plus presentation layer tactics that provided context for why Netflix chose a specific title for each member, as follows:</p><ul><li>Better algorithms + UI/design support/context = improved retention.</li></ul><p>Was it worth $1 million to execute the contest? Absolutely. The recruiting benefit alone made it worthwhile. Before the Netflix Prize, engineers considered Netflix “just another e-commerce company.” After the prize, they regarded Netflix as a highly innovative company.</p><h4>2010: Popularity Matters</h4><p>Netflix published all of its learnings from the Netflix Prize, and other companies studied the results. The music streaming service Pandora, whose personalization efforts focused on its “Music Genome Project,” was wary of weighting its algorithms with popularity. Instead, Pandora had forty “musicologists” who tagged each song with hundreds of attributes to explain why a listener would like a song. For example, musicologists tagged Jack Johnson’s songs as “optimistic, folksy, acoustic music with surfing, outdoor adventure, and coming of age themes.”</p><p>But as Pandora evaluated the results of the Netflix Prize (which weighted popularity highly), they began to execute collaborative filtering algorithms, too. These changes improved Pandora’s listening metrics. Pandora’s conclusion: popularity matters.</p><h4>2011: Netflix’s Movie Genome Project</h4><p>While admiring Pandora’s work and knowing that “the more algorithms, the better,” Netflix began to develop its own “movie genome” project. They hired thirty “moviecologists” to tag various attributes of movies and TV shows.</p><p>As a reminder, Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm predicts you’ll like a movie, but the algorithm can’t provide context for why you’ll like it. The Cinematch collaborative filtering algorithm leads to statements like, “Because you like <em>Batman Begins</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em>, we think you’ll like <em>Sesame Street</em>.” Wait, what?</p><p>Netflix’s new movie genome algorithm is called “Category Interest.” Now, for the first time, Netflix can suggest a movie and give context for why a member might like it. In the example below, Netflix knows I like <em>Airplane,</em> and <em>Heathers,</em> so suggests <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> and <em>The Breakfast Club</em> because I like “Cult Comedies from the 1980s”:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hXrO3iLQZ-ZszBan.png\" /><figcaption>Early execution of the “Category Interest” algorithm, circa 2011.</figcaption></figure><p>The “Category Interest” algorithm improved Netflix’s watching metrics — the percentage of members who watched at least forty hours a month — but the team did not execute an A/B test to see if it improved retention.</p><h4>2011: How the Personalization Algorithms Work</h4><p>In simplest terms, Netflix creates a forced rank list of movies for each user — from the content most likely to please to the least. Then this list is filtered, sliced, and diced according to attributes of the movies, TV shows, and the member’s tastes. For instance, a filter teases out a sub-list of movies and presents it in a row called “Quirky dramas with strong female heroines” or “Witty, irreverent TV shows.” Other row titles might include “Because You Watched <em>Stranger Things</em>, We Think You’ll Enjoy…” or “Top 10 for You.”</p><p>Netflix’s personalization approach has three components:</p><ol><li>A forced-rank list of titles for each member</li><li>An understanding of the most relevant filters for each member so the algorithms can present a subset of movies and TV shows from the list above, and</li><li>The ability to understand the most relevant rows for each member, depending on the platform, time of day, and lots of explicit/implicit movie taste data.</li></ol><p>The beauty of this approach is that these rows, with appropriate context, can be displayed on any device or screen. It’s easy to display the same row structure on all browsers and devices.</p><h4>2011: Netflix Proves Personalization Improved Retention</h4><p>Finally, In 2011, Netflix demonstrated a retention improvement in a large A/B test. However, the results were controversial as the test compared the default personalized experience at the time to a dumbed-down experience with no personalization. Netflix engineers complained the test was a waste of time. Most of the team had already accepted that personalization created a better experience for Netflix members.</p><p>Recognize that Netflix had made a very long-term, thirteen-year “leap of faith” investment in personalization until they finally had “proof” of retention improvement in 2011. But improvements in the proxy metric — the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies in their first two months with the service — gave Netflix the confidence to consistently “double down” on personalization.</p><h4>2012: Profiles Re-invented</h4><p>As Netflix moved beyond DVDs, it no longer required members to create an ordered list of movies. Instead, members hit the “Play” button to begin watching a movie or TV show.</p><p>Netflix had a profile feature during the DVD era, but only 2% of members used the feature, mainly because managing this forced-rank list of movies was time-consuming. But now, there’s nothing to manage. You provide Netflix with your name, three movies, or TV shows you enjoy, and Netflix creates a personalized experience for each user associated with that account.</p><p>Today, more than half of Netflix accounts have multiple profiles. Netflix knows the movie tastes for 200 million accounts, translating into an understanding of the movie tastes of 500 million separate movie-watchers tied to the 200 million accounts.</p><h4>2013: “House of Cards” Original Content Launch</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Al8vgH3AELDek_5D.jpeg\" /><figcaption>House of Cards, Netflix’s first big investment in original content, was actually an American remake of the British TV Series.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2007, during the DVD era, Netflix’s first original content effort, Red Envelope Studios, failed. Despite this failure, Netflix tried again during the streaming era.</p><p>Knowing that millions of members liked Kevin Spacey and <em>The West Wing</em>, Netflix made an initial $100M bet on <em>House of Cards</em>, which paid off. Over six seasons, Netflix invested more than $500 million in the series. <em>House of Cards</em> was the first of many successful original movies and television series that Netflix invested in.</p><p>By this time in Netflix’s history, it’s clear that personalization delights customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. By making movies easier to find, Netflix improves retention, which increases lifetime value (LTV). And Netflix’s personalization technology is tough to copy, especially at scale.</p><p>But there’s another aspect of personalization that improves the company’s margin: the ability for Netflix to “right-size” their content spend. Here are examples of Netflix’s right-sizing with my best estimates on multiple content investments:</p><ul><li>Based on its knowledge of member tastes, Netflix predicts that 100 million members will watch <em>Stranger Things</em> and invests $500 million in the series.</li><li>The data science team predicted 20 million watchers for the quirky adult cartoon Bojack Horseman, so Netflix invests $100 million in this animated TV series.</li><li>Based on a prediction that one million members will watch Everest climbing documentaries, Netflix invests $5 million in this genre.</li></ul><p>Netflix has a huge advantage in its ability to right-size its original content investment, fueled by its ability to forecast how many members will watch a specific movie, documentary, or TV show. Note: Netflix does not bring data-driven approaches to the movie creation process — they are hands-off with creators.</p><h4>2013: Netflix wins a Technical Emmy</h4><p>In 2013, Netflix won an Emmy award for “Personalized Recommendation Engines For Video Discovery.” This award hints at the degree to which Netflix will eventually dominate the Oscars, Emmy’s, and Golden Globe Awards for its original content.</p><h4>2015: Does It Matter if You’re French?</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*m1_5A3XSocbeBxg6.png\" /><figcaption>A Netflix PC-based homepage, en francais.</figcaption></figure><p>From 2015 to 2021, Netflix expanded from twenty to forty languages, as they launched their service into 190 countries. The personalization team wondered if they should inform the personalization algorithms with each member’s native language and country. The short answer, based on the results of A/B testing: “No.”</p><p>Like the demographics test in 2006, members’ tastes are so idiosyncratic that language and geography don’t help predict a member’s movie preferences. As before, the most efficient way to seed a member’s taste profile is to ask for a few TV shows or movies they love. Over time, Netflix builds from this “seed” as it informs its algorithms with the titles members rate, watch, stop watching, and even demonstrate an interest in a movie by clicking on the “Movie Display Page” or watching a preview.</p><h4>2016: Netflix Tests a Personalized Interface</h4><p>Three of the cultural values of Netflix are curiosity, candor, and courage. Netflix encourages new employees to challenge conventional wisdom when they join the company. Netflix appreciates the value of “fresh eyes” and encourages an iconoclastic culture.</p><p>A newly hired product leader at Netflix suggested that the team test “floating rows.” The idea was that rows like “Top 10 for Gib,” “Just Released,” and “Continue Watching” should be different for each member and even change depending on the device, time of day, and other factors. Conventional wisdom suggested an inconsistent site design would confuse and annoy customers, so it’s better to keep the interface consistent. But the “old guard” allowed the newbie to test it anyway.</p><p>As Ralph Waldon Emerson once said, “Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.” Surprisingly, the inconsistent interface performed better in AB tests. Today, even the user interface is personalized based on member’s taste preferences.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0UEiPclfrty0RXnt.png\" /><figcaption>Note that row names that Netflix presents to you are wildly inconsistent. In this screen capture for me on PC, Netflix leads with a row entitled “Trending Now” and puts the “Continue Watching” row in the second position. The interface changes each time you use it, depending on your recent activity, platform, and time of day.</figcaption></figure><h4>2017: From Stars to Thumbs</h4><p>By 2017, Netflix collected more than 5 billion star ratings. But over the last ten years, Facebook popularized a different rating system — thumbs up and down. By 2017, Facebook had introduced this simple gesture to more than two billion users worldwide.</p><p>Discovering which method inspires members to provide more taste data is simple: execute an A/B test of the five-star system against a thumbs up/down system. The result: the simpler thumbs system collected twice as many ratings.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EjJZPlynZqUj0DMd\" /><figcaption>In 2017, Netflix tested its five-star ratings system against Facebook’s “Thumbs Up/Down” interface. “Thumbs” doubled the amount of taste input from members.</figcaption></figure><p>Was this a surprising result? No. When you require a member to parse between three, four, or five stars, you force them to think too much. They become confounded and move on to the next activity without rating a movie. Clicking thumbs up or down is much easier. Here, as in many cases with user interfaces, simple trumps complete.</p><h4>2017: What Happens to The Five-Star System?</h4><p>If stars are gone, how do you communicate movie quality? Recall that one of Netflix’s early hypotheses was that, over time, the average ratings of the movies watched would increase, leading to improved retention. While there was evidence that average ratings increased, nothing in the Netflix data sets suggested that higher average ratings improved retention.</p><p>It turns out that movie ratings do not equal movie enjoyment. While you may appreciate that <em>Schindler’s List</em> or <em>Hotel Rwanda</em> are five-star movies, it doesn’t mean you <em>enjoy</em> them more than a three-star movie. Sometimes a “leave your brains at the door” comedy like <em>Paul Blart’s Mall Cop</em> is all you need. This is the reason that one of Netflix’s first big investments in original content was a four-picture deal with Adam Sandler, the king of sophomoric comedy. My favorite? <em>The Ridiculous Six</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*W9I_68chIpP1-bx6YmHd1g.jpeg\" /><figcaption>This was one of the movies in Adam Sandler’s $250 million-dollar, four-picture original content deal. Sometimes movie enjoyment is all about leaving your brains at the door with a good three-star movie.</figcaption></figure><h4>2017: Percentage Match</h4><p>So, with the loss of star ratings, and the insight that star ratings do not equal movie enjoyment, Netflix changed its system. They switched to a “percentage match” that indicated how much you would enjoy a movie, irrespective of its quality.</p><p>Below, Netflix gives an “80% Match” for me for <em>The</em> <em>Irishman</em>. There’s an 80% chance I will enjoy it, which is at the low-end for Netflix suggestions for me.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rQIJocjDc9hTn9Bi.png\" /><figcaption>Netflix no longer indicates the quality of a movie with its five-star system. It simply indicates the extent to which a title is a match for you, giving an indication of how much they think you will enjoy it.</figcaption></figure><h4>2018: Personalized Movie Art</h4><p>The Netflix personalization team wants to present you with the right title at the right time with as much context as possible to encourage you to watch that title. To do this, Netflix uses personalized visuals that cater to each member’s taste preferences.</p><p>Here’s a little more information from the Netflix tech blog:</p><blockquote><em>Let us consider trying to personalize the image we use to depict the movie </em>Good Will Hunting<em>. Here we might personalize this decision based on how much a member prefers different genres and themes. Someone who has watched many romantic movies may be interested in </em>Good Will Hunting<em> if we show the artwork containing Matt Damon and Minnie Driver, whereas, a member who has watched many comedies might be drawn to the movie if we use the artwork containing Robin Williams, a well-known comedian.</em></blockquote><p>Using the example above, the Netflix tech blog shares the titles that support each scenario, along with the unique movie art that Netflix presents to different members. The top row supports a member interested in romantic movies, with the image of Matt Damon and Minnie Driver as the hero. The bottom row is for members who enjoy watching well-known comedians. In this example, Robin Williams is featured.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sX45lPApwvEAwbmS.png\" /><figcaption>If you’re Into romantic comedies, Netflix uses the top-right movie art when it merchandises Good Will Hunting to you. If you like famous comedians, your personalized movie art features Robin Williams.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only does Netflix use its knowledge of member taste to choose the right movie, but it takes member tastes into account to support these choices through highly personalized visuals.</p><h4>2021: Do you feel lucky?</h4><p>The ultimate personalization is you turn on your TV, and Netflix magically plays a movie you’ll love. Netflix’s first experiment with this concept is a feature that the company co-CEO, Reed Hastings (jokingly), called the “I feel lucky” button.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/740/0*7ndlZF1Wwvc0K1dH.png\" /></figure><p>Note that when you sign onto your profile on a TV-based system, there’s a new “Play Something” button. Think of this button as a proxy for how well Netflix algorithms connect members with movies they’ll love. I’d guess that two to three percent of the plays come from this button today.

It’s a messy journey, with an evolving personalization strategy propelled by Netflix’s ability to execute high-cadence experiments using its home-grown A/B test system.\nIn twenty years, Netflix has gone from members choosing 2% of the movies the merchandising system suggests to 80% today. In the early days, a member would explore hundreds of titles before finding something they liked. Today most members look at forty choices before they hit the “play” button. Twenty years from now, Netflix hopes to play that one choice that’s “just right” for you with no browsing or choice required.\nHere’s one minute of reading for each year of Netflix’s twenty-year history! I hope you enjoy it.\n1998: A DVD-By-Mail Startup Is Born\nNetflix began as a DVD-by-mail startup, following the invention of the DVD player in 1996. In 1998 Netflix launched its website with less than 1,000 DVDs. Here’s what the site looked like its first few years:\nNetflix in 1999 had 2,600 DVDs to choose from. The service was a la carte. Netflix didn’t become an “all you can eat” subscription service until 2000.\nIn 1999, Netflix had 2,600 DVDs to choose from but intended to grow its library to 100,000 titles. To make it easier for members to find movies, Netflix developed a personalized merchandising system.\nIn 2000, when Netflix transitioned from an a la carte business to an all-you-can-eat subscription service, the service added a queue, a list of movies each household created by hitting the “Add” button to add a title to an ordered list of movies. Each time a member returned a DVD, Netflix would send the title at the top of each member’s Netflix Queue directly to their mailbox.\n2000: Cinematch\nNetflix introduced a personalized movie recommendation system, using member ratings to predict how much a member would like a movie. The algorithm was called Cinematch, and it’s a collaborative filtering algorithm.\nHere’s an easy way to understand collaborative filtering. Imagine I like “Batman Begins” and “Breaking Bad,” and you like both, too. Because I like “Casino,” the algorithm suggests you’ll like “Casino.” Now, apply this approach across millions of members and titles.\n2001: The Five-Star Rating System\nNetflix created a five-star rating system and eventually collected billions of ratings from its members. Netflix experimented with multiple “star bars,” at times stacking the stars to indicate expected rating, average rating, and friends’ rating. It was a mess.\nThe stars represented how much a member would like a movie. If a member had watched the movie already, they could rate it.\nThe red stars indicate the expected rating for a member, although most assumed It was the average rating.\n2002: Multiple Algorithms\nBeyond Cinematch, three other algorithms worked together to help merchandise movies:\n\nDynamic store. This algorithm indicated if the DVD was available. Late in the DVD era, the algorithm even determined if a DVD was available in a member’s local hub. By 2008, Netflix only merchandised locally available titles to increase the likelihood of next-day DVD delivery.\nMetasims. This algorithm incorporated all movie data available for each title — plot synopsis, director, actors, year, awards, language, etc.\nSearch. In the early days, there was little investment in search as the team assumed members searched for expensive new release DVDs, making the company’s economics more challenging. But the team discovered that the titles members chose included lots of older, less expensive, long-tail titles, so they eventually ramped up investment in search.\n\nIn time, Netflix blended lots of other algorithms to execute its personalized merchandising system.\n2004: Profiles\nRecognizing multiple family members used a shared account, Netflix launched “Profiles.” This feature enabled each family member to generate its own movie list. Profiles were a highly requested feature, but only two percent of members used it despite aggressive promotion. It was a lot of work to manage an ordered list of DVDs, and only one person in each household was willing to do this.\nGiven the low adoption, Netflix announced its plan to kill Profiles but capitulated in the face of member backlash. A small set of users cared deeply about the feature — they were afraid that losing Profiles would ruin their marriages. As an example of “all members are not created equal,” half the Netflix board used the feature.\n2004: Netflix Launches “Friends.”\nThe hypothesis: if you create a network of friends within Netflix, they’ll suggest great movie ideas to each other and won’t quit the service because they don’t want to leave their friends. At launch, 2% of Netflix members connected with at least one friend, but this metric never moved beyond 5%.\nFriends let you connect with friends on the service, then see what they watched and what they recommended to you.\nNetflix killed the feature in 2010 as part of its discipline of “scraping the barnacles” — removing features that members didn’t value. Unlike Profiles, there was no user revolt.\nTwo insights on social in the context of movies:\n\nYour friends have bad taste\nYou don’t want your friends to know all the movies you’re watching.\n\nThese are surprising insights during a decade when Facebook successfully applied its social strategy to many product categories.\n2006: The Netflix Personalization Strategy\nHere’s what the personalization strategy looked like in 2006. It’s organized in the Strategy/Metrics/Tactics format, with a proxy metric for each strategy, as well as tactics (projects) against each strategy:\n\nThe intent was to gather explicit and implicit data, then use various algorithms and presentation tactics to connect members with movies they’d love. The team focused on four main strategies:\n\nGather explicit taste data, including movie and TV show ratings, genre ratings, and demographic data.\nExplore implicit taste data like DVDs members added to their movie list or later, which movies members streamed.\nCreate algorithms and presentation layer tactics to connect members with movies they’ll love. This strategy focused on using the explicit/implicit taste data, along with lots of data about movies and TV shows (ratings, genres, synopsis, lead actors, directors, etc.), to create algorithms that connected members with titles. The expectation was that Netflix would also create a simple user interface that provided visual support for personalized choices.\nImprove average movie ratings for each member by connecting them with better movies and TV shows. The assumption was that if Netflix connected its members with higher quality movies and TV shows, they would retain better.\n\nThe high-level hypothesis: personalization would improve retention by making it easy for members to find movies they’ll love.\nThe high-level engagement metric was retention. It takes years to affect this metric, however. So Netflix had a more sensitive, short-term proxy metric: The percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies during their first two months with the service.\nThe theory was that members would rate lots of movies to get better recommendations. These ratings signaled that members appreciated the personalized recommendations they received in return for their ratings. More ratings were a signal that members appreciated Netflix’s personalized merchandising algorithms.\nHere’s a very rough snapshot of the improvement in this proxy metric over time:\nThe early proxy metric for Netflix’s personalization efforts was the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies or TV shows during their first two months with the service.\nWhy the 2011 dip in the metric? By this time, most members streamed movies, and Netflix had a strong implicit signal about member taste. Once you hit the “Play” button, you either kept watching or stopped. Netflix no longer needed to collect as many star ratings.\nIt took Netflix more than a decade to demonstrate that a personalized experience improved retention. But consistent growth in this proxy metric convinced the company to keep doubling down on personalization.\n2006: The Ratings Wizard\nThe original petri dish for personalization was an area on the site with a “Recommendations” tab. But testing revealed that members preferred less prescriptive language. The new tab had a “Movies You’ll Heart” tab that generated lots of clicks. The design team thought the tab was “fugly,” but it worked.\nWhen members arrived at the “Movies You’ll Heart” area, the site introduced them to the “Ratings Wizard”:\n\nMembers “binge-rated” while they waited for their DVDs to arrive. The Ratings Wizard was critical in moving the “percentage of members who rate at least 50 movies in their first two months” proxy metric. While members rated lots of movies using the “star bar” throughout the site, the Ratings Wizard was the major source of taste input.\n2006: Demographic Data\nNetflix collected age and gender data from its members, but when the team used demographics to inform predictions about a member’s movie taste, the algorithms did not improve predictive power. Huh?\nHow did Netflix measure predictive power? The proxy metric for the personalization algorithms was RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) — a calculation that measures the delta between the algorithm’s predicted rating and a member’s actual rating. If Netflix predicted you would like “Friends” and “Seinfeld” four and five stars respectively, and you rated these shows four and five stars, the prediction was perfect. RMSE is a “down and to the right” metric that improved over time, mainly through improvements in the collaborative filtering algorithm. You can see the improvements in the rough graph below:\nRoot Mean Square Error is a calculation of the predicted v. actual ratings for all Netflix members. It’s a “down and to the right” metric that got better over time.\nUnfortunately, age and gender data did not improve predictions — there was no improvement in RMSE. Movie tastes are hard to predict as they are idiosyncratic — they are very peculiar and vary radically from one individual to another. Knowing my age and gender doesn’t help predict my movie tastes. It’s much more helpful to know just a few movies or TV shows I like.\nTo see this insight in action today, create a new profile on your Netflix account. Netflix asks for a few titles you like to kickstart the personalization system. That’s all they need to seed the system.\n2006: Collaborative Filtering in the QUACL\nThe QUACL is the Queue Add Confirmation Layer. Once a member added a title to their Queue, a confirmation layer would pop up suggesting similar titles. Below, a member has added “Eiken” to their movie list, and the collaborative filtering algorithm suggests six similar titles:\nThe QUACL — the Queue Add Confirmation Layer — was a significant source of personalized merchandising.\nOver time, Netflix got better at suggesting similar titles for members to add to their queue. This drove the QUACL as a merchandising source from ten to fifteen percent of total queue adds over a few years. The QUACL was a great test environment for algorithm testing. In fact, Netflix executed some of its first machine learning tests within the QUACL.\n2006: The $1M Netflix Prize\nLike any startup, Netflix had limited resources. They had proven the value of “Cinematch” but had only one engineer focused on the algorithm. The solution: outsource algorithm development via The Netflix Prize.\nNetflix offered $1 Million to any team that could improve RMSE by at least 10%.\nNetflix offered a million-dollar prize to any team that improved RMSE for their Cinematch algorithm by ten percent. The personalization team provided anonymized data from Netflix members as training data for the teams, along with a second dataset that included members’ actual ratings so teams could test their algorithms’ predictive power. It took two years for teams to win the money — more on that in a moment.\n2007: Netflix Streaming Launch\nNetflix launched streaming in 2007. It was a free add-on for the DVD-by-mail service. The first streaming-only offering launched in Canada in 2010.\nNetflix launched streaming in January 2007. For the first time, the Netflix team had real-time data about what movies members watched, where before, they only had DVD rental activity. Over time, this implicit data became more important in predicting members’ movie tastes than the explicit data Netflix collected via its five-star rating system.\nAt the time of streaming launch in 2007, Netflix had nearly 100,000 DVDs to choose from, so the DVD merchandising challenge was to help members find “hidden gems” from its huge DVD library. However, with streaming, the challenge was to help members identify a few movies they’d find worthwhile among the three hundred fairly mediocre titles available at launch.\n2007: Netflix Prize\nThe “Netflix Prize” offered $1 million to any team that could improve the predictive power of Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm by 10%, as measured by RMSE, the delta between expected and actual rating for each movie. Two years later, “Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos” won the contest, beating 5,000 other teams.\nThere were two insights from the contest:\n\nAll ratings are not created equal. Contestants discovered that the ratings members provided for recent movies provided more predictive power than older ratings.\nThe more algorithms, the better. At the end of each year, Netflix paid a $50,000 progress prize to the leading team. On the final day of the year, the teams in second and third place combined their algorithms and vaulted to the top of the leaderboard to take the annual progress prize. That’s how teams learned the importance of combining lots of algorithms. That’s also why the team names were so strange — when teams combined their work, they created “mashup” names.\n\nAfter two years, the top team delivered a 10.06% increase in RMSE to win the million-dollar prize. “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” submitted its winning algorithm twenty-four minutes before the second-place team, “The Ensemble.” The two teams had identical scores, but “BellKor” submitted their entry first. Here’s the final leaderboard:\nThe leaderboard for the Netflix Prize at its conclusion in 2009. The fourth-place team, “Opera Solutions and Vandelay United,” was the combined submission of three teams and included an insider joke from “Seinfeld.”\n2009: The Next Big Netflix Prize\nWhen Netflix announced the winners of its first competition, it launched a second round. The new challenge was to use demographics and rental behavior to make better predictions. The algorithms could consider a member’s age, gender, ZIP code, and full rental history.\nWhen Netflix released anonymized customer information to start the second round, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in with a lawsuit arguing that the data wasn’t sufficiently anonymized. As part of the March 2010 settlement for that suit, Netflix canceled the second round.\n2010: Testing the New “Netflix Prize” Algorithm\nNetflix launched the Netflix Prize contest to provide better movie choices for members, which the team hoped would translate into retention improvement. But when Netflix executed the new algorithm in a large-scale A/B test, there was no measurable retention difference. It was a disappointing result.\nA new hypothesis emerged. To improve retention, you needed better algorithms plus presentation layer tactics that provided context for why Netflix chose a specific title for each member, as follows:\n\nBetter algorithms + UI/design support/context = improved retention.\n\nWas it worth $1 million to execute the contest? Absolutely. The recruiting benefit alone made it worthwhile. Before the Netflix Prize, engineers considered Netflix “just another e-commerce company.” After the prize, they regarded Netflix as a highly innovative company.\n2010: Popularity Matters\nNetflix published all of its learnings from the Netflix Prize, and other companies studied the results. The music streaming service Pandora, whose personalization efforts focused on its “Music Genome Project,” was wary of weighting its algorithms with popularity. Instead, Pandora had forty “musicologists” who tagged each song with hundreds of attributes to explain why a listener would like a song. For example, musicologists tagged Jack Johnson’s songs as “optimistic, folksy, acoustic music with surfing, outdoor adventure, and coming of age themes.”\nBut as Pandora evaluated the results of the Netflix Prize (which weighted popularity highly), they began to execute collaborative filtering algorithms, too. These changes improved Pandora’s listening metrics. Pandora’s conclusion: popularity matters.\n2011: Netflix’s Movie Genome Project\nWhile admiring Pandora’s work and knowing that “the more algorithms, the better,” Netflix began to develop its own “movie genome” project. They hired thirty “moviecologists” to tag various attributes of movies and TV shows.\nAs a reminder, Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm predicts you’ll like a movie, but the algorithm can’t provide context for why you’ll like it. The Cinematch collaborative filtering algorithm leads to statements like, “Because you like Batman Begins and Breaking Bad, we think you’ll like Sesame Street.” Wait, what?\nNetflix’s new movie genome algorithm is called “Category Interest.” Now, for the first time, Netflix can suggest a movie and give context for why a member might like it. In the example below, Netflix knows I like Airplane, and Heathers, so suggests Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and The Breakfast Club because I like “Cult Comedies from the 1980s”:\nEarly execution of the “Category Interest” algorithm, circa 2011.\nThe “Category Interest” algorithm improved Netflix’s watching metrics — the percentage of members who watched at least forty hours a month — but the team did not execute an A/B test to see if it improved retention.\n2011: How the Personalization Algorithms Work\nIn simplest terms, Netflix creates a forced rank list of movies for each user — from the content most likely to please to the least. Then this list is filtered, sliced, and diced according to attributes of the movies, TV shows, and the member’s tastes. For instance, a filter teases out a sub-list of movies and presents it in a row called “Quirky dramas with strong female heroines” or “Witty, irreverent TV shows.” Other row titles might include “Because You Watched Stranger Things, We Think You’ll Enjoy…” or “Top 10 for You.”\nNetflix’s personalization approach has three components:\n\nA forced-rank list of titles for each member\nAn understanding of the most relevant filters for each member so the algorithms can present a subset of movies and TV shows from the list above, and\nThe ability to understand the most relevant rows for each member, depending on the platform, time of day, and lots of explicit/implicit movie taste data.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that these rows, with appropriate context, can be displayed on any device or screen. It’s easy to display the same row structure on all browsers and devices.\n2011: Netflix Proves Personalization Improved Retention\nFinally, In 2011, Netflix demonstrated a retention improvement in a large A/B test. However, the results were controversial as the test compared the default personalized experience at the time to a dumbed-down experience with no personalization. Netflix engineers complained the test was a waste of time. Most of the team had already accepted that personalization created a better experience for Netflix members.\nRecognize that Netflix had made a very long-term, thirteen-year “leap of faith” investment in personalization until they finally had “proof” of retention improvement in 2011. But improvements in the proxy metric — the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies in their first two months with the service — gave Netflix the confidence to consistently “double down” on personalization.\n2012: Profiles Re-invented\nAs Netflix moved beyond DVDs, it no longer required members to create an ordered list of movies. Instead, members hit the “Play” button to begin watching a movie or TV show.\nNetflix had a profile feature during the DVD era, but only 2% of members used the feature, mainly because managing this forced-rank list of movies was time-consuming. But now, there’s nothing to manage. You provide Netflix with your name, three movies, or TV shows you enjoy, and Netflix creates a personalized experience for each user associated with that account.\nToday, more than half of Netflix accounts have multiple profiles. Netflix knows the movie tastes for 200 million accounts, translating into an understanding of the movie tastes of 500 million separate movie-watchers tied to the 200 million accounts.\n2013: “House of Cards” Original Content Launch\nHouse of Cards, Netflix’s first big investment in original content, was actually an American remake of the British TV Series.\nIn 2007, during the DVD era, Netflix’s first original content effort, Red Envelope Studios, failed. Despite this failure, Netflix tried again during the streaming era.\nKnowing that millions of members liked Kevin Spacey and The West Wing, Netflix made an initial $100M bet on House of Cards, which paid off. Over six seasons, Netflix invested more than $500 million in the series. House of Cards was the first of many successful original movies and television series that Netflix invested in.\nBy this time in Netflix’s history, it’s clear that personalization delights customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. By making movies easier to find, Netflix improves retention, which increases lifetime value (LTV). And Netflix’s personalization technology is tough to copy, especially at scale.\nBut there’s another aspect of personalization that improves the company’s margin: the ability for Netflix to “right-size” their content spend. Here are examples of Netflix’s right-sizing with my best estimates on multiple content investments:\n\nBased on its knowledge of member tastes, Netflix predicts that 100 million members will watch Stranger Things and invests $500 million in the series.\nThe data science team predicted 20 million watchers for the quirky adult cartoon Bojack Horseman, so Netflix invests $100 million in this animated TV series.\nBased on a prediction that one million members will watch Everest climbing documentaries, Netflix invests $5 million in this genre.\n\nNetflix has a huge advantage in its ability to right-size its original content investment, fueled by its ability to forecast how many members will watch a specific movie, documentary, or TV show. Note: Netflix does not bring data-driven approaches to the movie creation process — they are hands-off with creators.\n2013: Netflix wins a Technical Emmy\nIn 2013, Netflix won an Emmy award for “Personalized Recommendation Engines For Video Discovery.” This award hints at the degree to which Netflix will eventually dominate the Oscars, Emmy’s, and Golden Globe Awards for its original content.\n2015: Does It Matter if You’re French?\nA Netflix PC-based homepage, en francais.\nFrom 2015 to 2021, Netflix expanded from twenty to forty languages, as they launched their service into 190 countries. The personalization team wondered if they should inform the personalization algorithms with each member’s native language and country. The short answer, based on the results of A/B testing: “No.”\nLike the demographics test in 2006, members’ tastes are so idiosyncratic that language and geography don’t help predict a member’s movie preferences. As before, the most efficient way to seed a member’s taste profile is to ask for a few TV shows or movies they love. Over time, Netflix builds from this “seed” as it informs its algorithms with the titles members rate, watch, stop watching, and even demonstrate an interest in a movie by clicking on the “Movie Display Page” or watching a preview.\n2016: Netflix Tests a Personalized Interface\nThree of the cultural values of Netflix are curiosity, candor, and courage. Netflix encourages new employees to challenge conventional wisdom when they join the company. Netflix appreciates the value of “fresh eyes” and encourages an iconoclastic culture.\nA newly hired product leader at Netflix suggested that the team test “floating rows.” The idea was that rows like “Top 10 for Gib,” “Just Released,” and “Continue Watching” should be different for each member and even change depending on the device, time of day, and other factors. Conventional wisdom suggested an inconsistent site design would confuse and annoy customers, so it’s better to keep the interface consistent. But the “old guard” allowed the newbie to test it anyway.\nAs Ralph Waldon Emerson once said, “Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.” Surprisingly, the inconsistent interface performed better in AB tests. Today, even the user interface is personalized based on member’s taste preferences.\nNote that row names that Netflix presents to you are wildly inconsistent. In this screen capture for me on PC, Netflix leads with a row entitled “Trending Now” and puts the “Continue Watching” row in the second position. The interface changes each time you use it, depending on your recent activity, platform, and time of day.\n2017: From Stars to Thumbs\nBy 2017, Netflix collected more than 5 billion star ratings. But over the last ten years, Facebook popularized a different rating system — thumbs up and down. By 2017, Facebook had introduced this simple gesture to more than two billion users worldwide.\nDiscovering which method inspires members to provide more taste data is simple: execute an A/B test of the five-star system against a thumbs up/down system. The result: the simpler thumbs system collected twice as many ratings.\nIn 2017, Netflix tested its five-star ratings system against Facebook’s “Thumbs Up/Down” interface. “Thumbs” doubled the amount of taste input from members.\nWas this a surprising result? No. When you require a member to parse between three, four, or five stars, you force them to think too much. They become confounded and move on to the next activity without rating a movie. Clicking thumbs up or down is much easier. Here, as in many cases with user interfaces, simple trumps complete.\n2017: What Happens to The Five-Star System?\nIf stars are gone, how do you communicate movie quality? Recall that one of Netflix’s early hypotheses was that, over time, the average ratings of the movies watched would increase, leading to improved retention. While there was evidence that average ratings increased, nothing in the Netflix data sets suggested that higher average ratings improved retention.\nIt turns out that movie ratings do not equal movie enjoyment. While you may appreciate that Schindler’s List or Hotel Rwanda are five-star movies, it doesn’t mean you enjoy them more than a three-star movie. Sometimes a “leave your brains at the door” comedy like Paul Blart’s Mall Cop is all you need. This is the reason that one of Netflix’s first big investments in original content was a four-picture deal with Adam Sandler, the king of sophomoric comedy. My favorite? The Ridiculous Six.\nThis was one of the movies in Adam Sandler’s $250 million-dollar, four-picture original content deal. Sometimes movie enjoyment is all about leaving your brains at the door with a good three-star movie.\n2017: Percentage Match\nSo, with the loss of star ratings, and the insight that star ratings do not equal movie enjoyment, Netflix changed its system. They switched to a “percentage match” that indicated how much you would enjoy a movie, irrespective of its quality.\nBelow, Netflix gives an “80% Match” for me for The Irishman. There’s an 80% chance I will enjoy it, which is at the low-end for Netflix suggestions for me.\nNetflix no longer indicates the quality of a movie with its five-star system. It simply indicates the extent to which a title is a match for you, giving an indication of how much they think you will enjoy it.\n2018: Personalized Movie Art\nThe Netflix personalization team wants to present you with the right title at the right time with as much context as possible to encourage you to watch that title. To do this, Netflix uses personalized visuals that cater to each member’s taste preferences.\nHere’s a little more information from the Netflix tech blog:\nLet us consider trying to personalize the image we use to depict the movie Good Will Hunting. Here we might personalize this decision based on how much a member prefers different genres and themes. Someone who has watched many romantic movies may be interested in Good Will Hunting if we show the artwork containing Matt Damon and Minnie Driver, whereas, a member who has watched many comedies might be drawn to the movie if we use the artwork containing Robin Williams, a well-known comedian.\nUsing the example above, the Netflix tech blog shares the titles that support each scenario, along with the unique movie art that Netflix presents to different members. The top row supports a member interested in romantic movies, with the image of Matt Damon and Minnie Driver as the hero. The bottom row is for members who enjoy watching well-known comedians. In this example, Robin Williams is featured.\nIf you’re Into romantic comedies, Netflix uses the top-right movie art when it merchandises Good Will Hunting to you. If you like famous comedians, your personalized movie art features Robin Williams.\nNot only does Netflix use its knowledge of member taste to choose the right movie, but it takes member tastes into account to support these choices through highly personalized visuals.\n2021: Do you feel lucky?\nThe ultimate personalization is you turn on your TV, and Netflix magically plays a movie you’ll love. Netflix’s first experiment with this concept is a feature that the company co-CEO, Reed Hastings (jokingly), called the “I feel lucky” button.\n\nNote that when you sign onto your profile on a TV-based system, there’s a new “Play Something” button. Think of this button as a proxy for how well Netflix algorithms connect members with movies they’ll love. I’d guess that two to three percent of the plays come from this button today. If this “Play Something” button generates ten percent usage a few years from now, it’s a strong indication that Netflix personalization is doing a better job connecting its members with movies they’ll love.\nHere’s the long-term personalization vision: twenty years from now, Netflix will eliminate both the “Play Something” button and its personalized merchandising system, and that one special movie you’re in the mood to watch at that particular moment will automatically begin to play.\nMy guess is that Netflix will achieve this vision within twenty years. They’ve come a long way in the last twenty years, so I think this is feasible.\nConclusion\nToday, more than 80% of the TV shows and movies that Netflix members watch are merchandised to you by Netflix’s personalization algorithms.\nNetflix’s personalization journey has had its share of ups and downs. But eventually, personalization enabled Netflix to build a hard-to-copy technological advantage that delights customers in margin-enhancing ways.\nFor product leaders engaged in innovative projects, Netflix’s journey highlights the need for:\n\na plan — a product strategy with accompanying metrics and tactics\na method to quickly test various hypotheses, and\na culture that encourages risk-taking, intellectual curiosity, candor, plus the courage to say, “Let’s try this idea.”\n\nThe last requirement: patience. It takes decades to build a world-class product and company.\nOne Last Thing!\nIf you have a moment, I’d love your feedback on this essay. Click here to give me feedback.

It’s a messy journey, with an evolving personalization strategy propelled by Netflix’s ability to execute high-cadence experiments using its home-grown A/B test system.</p><p>In twenty years, Netflix has gone from members choosing 2% of the movies the merchandising system suggests to 80% today. In the early days, a member would explore hundreds of titles before finding something they liked. Today most members look at forty choices before they hit the “play” button. Twenty years from now, Netflix hopes to play that one choice that’s “just right” for you with no browsing or choice required.</p><p>Here’s one minute of reading for each year of Netflix’s twenty-year history! I hope you enjoy it.</p><h4>1998: A DVD-By-Mail Startup Is Born</h4><p>Netflix began as a DVD-by-mail startup, following the invention of the DVD player in 1996. In 1998 Netflix launched its website with less than 1,000 DVDs. Here’s what the site looked like its first few years:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*LAiPqUgYqbf87WDu.png\" /></figure><p>In 1999, Netflix had 2,600 DVDs to choose from but intended to grow its library to 100,000 titles. To make it easier for members to find movies, Netflix developed a personalized merchandising system.</p><p>During this time, Netflix became famous for its Queue, a list of movies each household would create by hitting the “Add” button to add a title to an ordered list of movies. Each time a member returned a DVD, Netflix would send the title at the top of their Queue to their home.</p><h4>2000: Cinematch</h4><p>Netflix introduced a personalized movie recommendation system, using member ratings to predict how much a member would like a movie. The algorithm was called Cinematch, and it’s a collaborative filtering algorithm.</p><p>Here’s an easy way to understand collaborative filtering: Imagine I like “Batman Begins” and “Breaking Bad,” and you like both, too. Because I like “Casino,” the algorithm suggests you’ll like “Casino.” Now, apply this approach across millions of members and titles.</p><h4>2001: The Five-Star Rating System</h4><p>Netflix created a five-star rating system and eventually collected billions of ratings from its members. Netflix experimented with multiple “star bars,” at times stacking the stars to indicate expected rating, average rating, and friends’ rating. (It was a mess.)</p><p>The stars represented how much a member would like a movie. If a member had watched the movie already, they could rate it. The red “Add” button added the movie to a member’s queue.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Zfv400Pi3L1F7EEv.png\" /></figure><h4>2002: Multiple Algorithms</h4><p>Beyond Cinematch, three other algorithms worked together to merchandise movies:</p><ol><li><strong>Dynamic store.</strong> This algorithm indicated if the DVD was available to merchandise. Late in the DVD era, the algorithm also determined if a DVD was available in a member’s local hub. (By 2008, Netflix only merchandised locally available titles to increase the likelihood of next-day DVD delivery.)</li><li><strong>Metasims.</strong> Included all movie data available for each title — plot synopsis, director, actors, year, awards, language, etc.</li><li><strong>Search.</strong> There was little investment in search in the early days as Netflix assumed members searched for expensive new release DVDs, making the company’s economics more challenging. But the team discovered that the titles members chose included lots of older, less expensive, long-tail titles, so they eventually ramped up investment in search.</li></ol><p>In time, Netflix blended lots of other algorithms to execute its personalized merchandising system.</p><h4>2004: Profiles</h4><p>Recognizing multiple family members used a shared account, Netflix launched “Profiles.” This feature enabled each family member to generate its own movie list. It was a highly requested feature, but only two percent of members used it despite the aggressive promotion. It was a lot of work to manage an ordered list of DVDs, and only one person in each household was willing to do this.</p><p>Given the low adoption, Netflix announced its plan to kill the feature but capitulated in the face of member backlash. A small set of users cared deeply about the feature — they were afraid that losing Profiles would ruin their marriages. As an example of “all members are not created equal,” half the Netflix board used the feature.</p><h4>2004: Netflix Launches “Friends.”</h4><p>The hypothesis: if you create a network of friends within Netflix, they’ll suggest great movie ideas to each other and won’t quit the service because they don’t want to leave their friends. At launch, 2% of Netflix members connected with at least one friend, but this metric never moved beyond 5%.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*FjmhXp3cGaONkzWm.png\" /></figure><p>Netflix killed the feature in 2010 as part of its discipline of “scraping barnacles” — removing features that members didn’t value. Unlike Profiles, there was no user revolt.</p><p>Two insights on social in the context of movies:</p><ol><li>Your friends have bad taste</li><li>You don’t want your friends to know all the movies you’re watching.</li></ol><p>These are surprising insights during a decade when Facebook successfully applied its social strategy to many product categories.</p><h4>2006: The Netflix Personalization Strategy</h4><p>Here’s what the personalization strategy looked like in 2006:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*T4l48_tyhUnDGr42.png\" /></figure><p>The intent was to gather explicit and implicit data, then use various algorithms and presentation tactics to connect members with movies they’d love. The team focused on four main strategies:</p><ol><li><strong>Gather explicit taste data,</strong> including movie and TV show ratings, genre ratings, and demographic data.</li><li><strong>Explore</strong> <strong>implicit taste data</strong> like DVDs members added to their movie list or later, which movies members streamed.</li><li><strong>Create algorithms and presentation layer tactics to connect members with movies they’ll love</strong>. Use the explicit/implicit taste data, along with lots of data about movies and TV shows (ratings, genres, synopsis, lead actors, directors, etc.), to create algorithms that connect members with titles. Also, create a simple user interface that provides visual support for personalized choices.</li><li><strong>Improve average movie ratings for each member</strong> by connecting them with better movies and TV shows.</li></ol><p>The high-level hypothesis: personalization would improve retention by making it easy for members to find movies they’ll love.</p><p>The high-level engagement metric was retention. However, it takes years to affect this metric. So Netflix had a more sensitive, short-term proxy metric: The percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies during their first two months with the service.</p><p>The theory was that members would rate lots of movies to get better recommendations. These ratings signaled that members appreciated the personalized recommendations they received in return for their ratings. So the more ratings a member gave, the more they appreciated Netflix’s personalization.</p><p>Here’s a rough snapshot of the improvement in this proxy metric over time:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2XrxGR-PVVKb1J8i.png\" /><figcaption>The early proxy metric for Netflix’s personalization efforts was the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies or TV shows during their first two months with the service.</figcaption></figure><p>Why the 2011 dip in the metric? By this time, most members streamed movies, and Netflix had a strong implicit signal about member taste. Once you hit the “Play” button, you either kept watching or stopped. Netflix no longer needed to collect as many star ratings.</p><p>It took Netflix more than a decade to demonstrate that a personalized experience improved retention. But consistent growth in this proxy metric convinced the company to keep doubling down on personalization until many years later, Netflix proved that personalization improved retention in a large-scale retention test.</p><h4>2006: The Ratings Wizard</h4><p>The original petri dish for personalization was an area on the site with a “Recommendations” tab. But testing revealed that members preferred less prescriptive language. The new tab had a “Movies You’ll Heart” tab that generated lots of clicks. The design team thought the tab was “fugly,” but it worked.</p><p>When members arrived at the “Movies You’ll Heart” area, the site introduced them to the “Ratings Wizard”:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kZZ43K5lcu-Pu9yZ.png\" /></figure><p>Members “binge-rated” while they waited for their DVDs to arrive. The Ratings Wizard was critical in moving the “percentage of members who rate at least 50 movies in their first two months” proxy metric. While members rated lots of movies using the “star bar” throughout the site, the Ratings Wizard was the major source of taste input.</p><h4>2006: Demographic Data</h4><p>Netflix collected age and gender data from its members, but when the team used demographics to inform predictions about a member’s movie taste, the algorithms did not improve predictive power. Huh?</p><p>How did Netflix measure predictive power? The proxy metric for the personalization algorithms was RMSE (Root Mean Squared-Error) — a calculation that measures the delta between the algorithm’s predicted rating and a member’s actual rating. If Netflix predicted you would like “Friends” and “Seinfeld” four and five stars respectively, and you rated these shows four and five stars, the prediction was perfect. RMSE is a “down and to the right” metric that improved over time, mainly through improvements in the collaborative filtering algorithm. You can see the improvements, over time, in the graph below:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AkUtLLdi5Q49HCIf.png\" /><figcaption>Root Mean Squared Error was a calculation of the predicted v. actual ratings for all Netflix members. It’s a “down and to the right” metric that got better over time.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, age and gender data did not improve predictions — there was no improvement in RMSE. Movie tastes are hard to predict as they are idiosyncratic — they are very peculiar and vary radically from one individual to another. Knowing my age and gender doesn’t help predict my movie tastes. It’s much more helpful to know just a few movies or TV shows I like.</p><p>To see this insight in action today, create a new profile on your Netflix account. Netflix asks you for a few titles you like to kickstart the personalization system. That’s all they need to seed the system.</p><h4>2006: Collaborative Filtering in the QUACL</h4><p>The QUACL is the Queue Add Confirmation Layer. Once a member added a title to their Queue, a confirmation layer would pop up suggesting similar titles. Below, a member has added “Eiken” to their movie list, and the collaborative filtering algorithm suggests six similar titles:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/670/0*ELh-Ov_TEeuZhnH6.png\" /></figure><p>Over time, Netflix got better at suggesting similar titles for members to add to their queue, which drove this merchandising source from ten to fifteen percent of total queue adds over a few years. The QUACL was a great test environment for algorithm testing. In fact, Netflix executed some of its first machine learning tests within the QUACL.</p><h4>2006: The $1M Netflix Prize</h4><p>Like any startup, Netflix had limited resources. They had proven the value of “Cinematch” but had only one engineer focused on the algorithm. The solution: outsource the problem via The Netflix Prize.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/0*UkjjhZLG1pOEw1Y6.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Netflix offered $1 Million to any team that could improve RMSE by at least 10%.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix offered a million-dollar prize to any team that improved RMSE for their “Cinematch” algorithm by ten percent. The personalization team provided anonymized data from their members as training data for the teams, along with a second dataset that included members’ actual ratings so teams could test their algorithms’ predictive power. It took two years for teams to win the money — more on that in a moment.</p><h4>2007: Netflix Streaming Launch</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Rbn7iUWPbxC6jjkh.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Netflix launched streaming in 2007. It was a free add-on for the DVD-by-mail service—the first streaming-only service launched in Canada in 2010.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix launched streaming in January 2007. For the first time, the Netflix team had real-time data about what movies members watched, where before, they only had DVD rental activity. Over time, this implicit data became more important in predicting members’ movie tastes than the explicit data Netflix collected via its five-star rating system.</p><p>At the time of streaming launch in 2007, Netflix had nearly 100,000 DVDs to choose from, so the DVD merchandising challenge was to help members find “hidden gems” from its huge DVD library. However, with streaming, the challenge was to help members identify a few movies they’d find worthwhile among the three hundred mediocre titles available at launch.</p><h4>2007: Netflix Prize</h4><p>The “Netflix Prize” offered $1 million to any team that could improve the predictive power of Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm by 10%, as measured by RMSE, the delta between expected and actual rating for each movie. Two years later, “Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos” finally won the contest, beating 5,000 other teams.</p><p>There were two insights from the contest:</p><ul><li><strong>All ratings are not created equal.</strong> Contestants discovered that the ratings members provided for recent movies provided more predictive power than older ratings.</li><li><strong>The more algorithms, the better.</strong> At the end of each year, Netflix paid a $50,000 progress prize to the leading team. On the final day of the year, the teams in second and third place combined their algorithms and vaulted to the top of the leaderboard to take the progress prize. That’s how teams learned the importance of combining lots of algorithms. (That’s also why the team names were so strange — when teams combined their work, they created “mashup” names.)</li></ul><p>After two years, the top team delivered a 10.06% increase in RMSE to win the million-dollar prize. “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” submitted its winning algorithm twenty-four minutes before the second-place team, “The Ensemble.” The two teams had identical scores, but “BellKor” submitted their entry first. Here’s the final leaderboard:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EyFRinwD-IY0rv9S.png\" /><figcaption>The leaderboard for the Netflix Prize at its conclusion in 2009. “Opera Solutions and Vandelay United” was the combined submission of three teams, including an insider’s joke from “Seinfeld.”</figcaption></figure><h4>2009: The Next Big Netflix Prize</h4><p>When Netflix announced the winners of its first competition, it launched a second round. The new challenge was to use demographics and rental behavior to make better predictions. The algorithms could consider a member’s age, gender, ZIP code, and full rental history.</p><p>When Netflix released anonymized customer information to start the second round, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in with a lawsuit contending that the data wasn’t sufficiently anonymized. As part of the March 2010 settlement for that suit, Netflix canceled the second round.</p><h4>2010: Testing the New “Netflix Prize” Algorithm</h4><p>Netflix launched the Netflix Prize contest to provide better movie choices for members, which the team hoped would translate into retention improvement. But when Netflix executed the new algorithm in a large-scale A/B test, there was no measurable retention difference. It was a disappointing result.</p><p>A new hypothesis emerged. To improve retention, you needed better algorithms plus presentation layer tactics that provided context for why Netflix chose a specific title for each member, as follows:</p><ul><li>Better algorithms + UI/design support/context = improved retention.</li></ul><p>Was it worth $1 million to execute the contest? Absolutely. The recruiting benefit alone made it worthwhile. Before the Netflix Prize, engineers considered Netflix just another e-commerce company. After the prize, they regarded Netflix as a highly innovative company.</p><h4>2010: Popularity Matters</h4><p>Netflix published all of its learnings from the Netflix Prize, and other companies studied the results. The music streaming service Pandora, whose personalization efforts focused on its “Music Genome Project,” was wary of weighting its algorithms with popularity. Instead, Pandora had forty “musicologists” who tagged each song with hundreds of attributes to explain why a listener would like a song. For example, musicologists tagged Jack Johnson’s songs as “optimistic, folksy, acoustic music with surfing, outdoor adventure, and coming of age themes.”</p><p>But as Pandora evaluated the results of the Netflix Prize (which weighted popularity highly), they began to execute collaborative filtering algorithms, too. These changes improved Pandora’s listening metrics. Pandora’s conclusion: popularity matters.</p><h4>2011: Netflix’s Movie Genome Project</h4><p>While admiring Pandora’s work and knowing that “the more algorithms, the better,” Netflix began to develop its own “movie genome” project, hiring thirty “moviecologists” to tag various attributes of movies and TV shows.</p><p>As a reminder, Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm predicts you’ll like a movie, but the algorithm can’t provide context for why you’ll like it. The Cinematch collaborative filtering algorithm leads to statements like, “Because you like <em>Batman Begins</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em>, we think you’ll like <em>Sesame Street</em>.” Wait, what?</p><p>Netflix’s new movie genome algorithm is called “Category Interest.” Now, for the first time, Netflix can suggest a movie and give context for why a member might like it. In the example below, Netflix knows I like <em>Airplane,</em> and <em>Heathers,</em> so suggests <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> and <em>The Breakfast Club</em> because I like “Cult Comedies from the 1980s”:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hXrO3iLQZ-ZszBan.png\" /><figcaption>Early execution of the “Category Interest” algorithm, circa 2011.</figcaption></figure><p>The “Category Interest” algorithm improved Netflix’s watching metrics — the percentage of members who watched at least forty hours a month — but the team did not execute an A/B test to see if it improved retention.</p><h4>2011: How the Personalization Algorithms Work</h4><p>In simplest terms, Netflix creates a forced rank list of movies for each user — from the content most likely to please to the least. Then this list is filtered, sliced, and diced according to attributes of the movies, TV shows, and the member’s tastes. For instance, a filter teases out a sub-list of movies and presents it in a row called “Quirky dramas with strong female heroines” or “Witty, irreverent TV shows.” Other rows might be titled, “Because You Watched <em>Stranger Things</em>, We Think You’ll Enjoy…” or “Top 10 for You.”</p><p>Netflix’s personalization approach has three components:</p><ol><li>A forced-rank list of titles for each member</li><li>An understanding of the most relevant filters for each member so the algorithms can present a subset of movies and TV shows from the list above, and</li><li>The ability to understand the most relevant rows for each member, depending on the platform, time of day, and lots of explicit/implicit movie taste data.</li></ol><p>The beauty of this approach is that these rows, with appropriate context, can be displayed on any device or screen. It’s easy to display this same row structure on all browsers and devices.</p><h4>2011: Netflix Proves Personalization Improved Retention</h4><p>Finally, In 2011, Netflix demonstrated a retention improvement in a large A/B test. However, the results were controversial as the test compared the default personalized experience to a dumbed-down experience with no personalization. Netflix engineers complained the test was a waste of time. By this time, most of the team accepted that personalization created a better experience for Netflix members.</p><p>Recognize that Netflix had made a very long-term, thirteen-year “leap of faith” investment in personalization until they finally had “proof” of retention improvement in 2011. But improvements in the proxy metric — the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies in their first two months with the service — gave Netflix the confidence to consistently “double down” on personalization.</p><h4>2012: Profiles Re-invented</h4><p>As Netflix moved beyond DVDs, it no longer required members to create an ordered list of movies. Instead, members hit the “Play” button to begin watching a movie or TV show.</p><p>Netflix had a profile feature during the DVD era, but only 2% of members used the feature, mainly because managing this forced-rank list of movies was time-consuming. But now, there’s nothing to manage. You provide Netflix with your name, three movies, or TV shows you enjoy, and Netflix creates a personalized experience for each user associated with that account.</p><p>Today, more than half of Netflix accounts have multiple profiles. Netflix knows the movie tastes for 200 million accounts, translating into an understanding of the movie tastes of 500 million separate movie-watchers.</p><h4>2013: “House of Cards” Original Content Launch</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Al8vgH3AELDek_5D.jpeg\" /><figcaption>House of Cards, Netflix’s first big investment in original content, was actually an American remake of the British TV Series.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2007, during the DVD era, Netflix’s first original content effort, Red Envelope Studios, failed. Despite this failure, Netflix tried again during the streaming era.</p><p>Knowing that millions of members liked Kevin Spacey and <em>The West Wing</em>, Netflix made an initial $100M bet on <em>House of Cards</em>, which paid off. Over six seasons, Netflix invested more than $500 million in the series. <em>House of Cards</em> was the first of many successful original movies and television series.</p><p>By this time in Netflix’s history, it’s clear that personalization delights customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. By making movies easier to find, Netflix improves retention, which increases lifetime value (LTV). And Netflix’s personalization technology is tough to copy, especially at scale.</p><p>But there’s another aspect of personalization that improves the company’s margin: the ability for Netflix to “right-size” their content spend. Here are examples of Netflix’s right-sizing with my best estimates on content investments:</p><ul><li>Based on its knowledge of member tastes, Netflix predicts that 100 million members will watch <em>Stranger Things</em> and invests $500 million in the series.</li><li>For a quirkier adult cartoon, <em>Bojack Horseman</em>, the data science team predicts 20 million watchers, so they invest $100 million in this animated TV series.</li><li>Based on a prediction that one million members will watch Everest climbing documentaries, Netflix invests $5 million in this genre.</li></ul><p>Netflix has a huge advantage in its ability to right-size its original content investment, fueled by its ability to forecast how many members will watch a specific movie, documentary, or TV show. Note: Netflix does not bring data-driven approaches to the movie creation process — they are hands-off with creators.</p><h4>2013: Netflix wins a Technical Emmy</h4><p>In 2013, Netflix won an Emmy award for “Personalized Recommendation Engines For Video Discovery.” This award hints at the degree to which Netflix will eventually dominate the Oscars, Emmy’s, and Golden Globe Awards for its original content.</p><h4>2015: Does It Matter if You’re French?</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*m1_5A3XSocbeBxg6.png\" /><figcaption>A Netflix PC-based homepage, en francais.</figcaption></figure><p>From 2015 to 2021, Netflix expanded from twenty to forty languages, as they launched their service into 190 countries. The personalization team wondered if they should inform the personalization algorithms with each member’s native language and country. The short answer, based on the results of A/B testing: “No.”</p><p>Like the demographics test in 2006, members’ tastes are so idiosyncratic that language and geography don’t help predict a member’s movie preferences. As before, the most efficient way to seed a member’s taste profile is to ask for a few TV shows or movies they love. Over time, Netflix builds from this “seed” as it informs its algorithms with the titles members rate, watch, stop watching, and even demonstrate an interest in by clicking on the “Movie Display Page” or watching a preview.</p><h4>2016: Netflix Tests a Personalized Interface</h4><p>Some of the cultural values of Netflix are curiosity, candor, and courage. Netflix encourages new employees to challenge conventional wisdom when they join the company. Netflix appreciates the value of “fresh eyes” and encourages an iconoclastic culture.</p><p>A newly hired product leader at Netflix suggested that the team test “floating rows.” The idea was that rows like “Top 10 for Gib,” “Just Released,” and “Continue Watching” should be different for each member and even change depending on the device, time of day, and other factors. Conventional wisdom suggested an inconsistent site design would confuse and annoy customers, so it’s better to keep the interface consistent. But the “old guard” allowed the newbie to test it anyway.</p><p>As Ralph Waldon Emerson once said, “Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.” Surprisingly, the inconsistent interface performed better in AB tests. Today, even the user interface is personalized based on member’s taste preferences.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0UEiPclfrty0RXnt.png\" /><figcaption>Note that row names that Netflix presents to you are wildly inconsistent. In this screen capture for me on PC, Netflix leads with a row entitled “Trending Now” and puts the “Continue Watching” row in the second position. The interface changes each time you use it, depending on your recent activity, platform, and even time of day.</figcaption></figure><h4>2017: From Stars to Thumbs</h4><p>By 2017, Netflix collected more than 5 billion star ratings. But over the last ten years, Facebook popularized a different rating system — thumbs up and down. By 2017, Facebook had introduced this simple gesture to more than two billion users worldwide.</p><p>Discovering which method inspires members to provide more taste data is simple: execute an A/B test of the five-star system against a thumbs up/down system. The result: the simpler thumbs system collected twice as many ratings.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EjJZPlynZqUj0DMd\" /><figcaption>In 2017, Netflix tested its five-star ratings system against Facebook’s “Thumbs Up/Down” interface. “Thumbs” doubled the amount of taste input from members.</figcaption></figure><p>Was this a surprising result? No. When you require a member to parse between three, four, or five stars, you force them to think too much. They become confounded and move on to the next activity without rating a movie. Clicking thumbs up or down is much easier. Here, as in many cases with user interfaces, simple trumps complete.</p><h4>2017: What Happens to The Five-Star System?</h4><p>If stars are gone, how do you communicate movie quality? Recall that one of Netflix’s early hypotheses was that, over time, the average ratings of the movies watched would increase, leading to improved retention. While there was evidence that average ratings increased, nothing in the Netflix data sets suggested that higher average ratings improved retention.</p><p>It turns out that movie ratings do not equal movie enjoyment. While you may appreciate that <em>Schindler’s List</em> or <em>Hotel Rwanda</em> are five-star movies, it doesn’t mean you <em>enjoy</em> them more than a three-star movie. Sometimes a “leave your brains at the door” comedy like <em>Paul Blart’s Mall Cop</em> is all you need. This is the reason that one of Netflix’s first big investments in original content was a six-picture deal with Adam Sandler, the king of sophomoric comedy.

To do this, Netflix uses personalized visuals that cater to each member’s taste preferences. Here’s more from the Netflix tech blog:</p><blockquote><em>Let us consider trying to personalize the image we use to depict the movie </em>Good Will Hunting<em>. Here we might personalize this decision based on how much a member prefers different genres and themes. Someone who has watched many romantic movies may be interested in </em>Good Will Hunting<em> if we show the artwork containing Matt Damon and Minnie Driver, whereas, a member who has watched many comedies might be drawn to the movie if we use the artwork containing Robin Williams, a well-known comedian.</em></blockquote><p>Using the example above, the Netflix tech blog shares the titles that support each scenario, along with the unique movie art that Netflix presents to different members. The top row supports a member interested in romantic movies, with the image of Matt Damon and Minnie Driver as the hero. The bottom row is for members who enjoy watching well-known comedians. In that example, Robin Williams is featured.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sX45lPApwvEAwbmS.png\" /><figcaption>If. you’re Into romantic comedies, Netflix uses the top-right movie art when it merchandises GoodWill Hunting to you.

It’s a messy journey, with an evolving personalization strategy propelled by Netflix’s ability to execute high-cadence experiments using its home-grown A/B test system.\nIn twenty years, Netflix has gone from members choosing 2% of the movies the merchandising system suggests to 80% today. In the early days, a member would explore hundreds of titles before finding something they liked. Today most members look at forty choices before they hit the “play” button. Twenty years from now, Netflix hopes to play that one choice that’s “just right” for you with no browsing or choice required.\nHere’s one minute of reading for each year of Netflix’s twenty-year history! I hope you enjoy it.\n1998: A DVD-By-Mail Startup Is Born\nNetflix began as a DVD-by-mail startup, following the invention of the DVD player in 1996. In 1998 Netflix launched its website with less than 1,000 DVDs. Here’s what the site looked like its first few years:\n\nIn 1999, Netflix had 2,600 DVDs to choose from but intended to grow its library to 100,000 titles. To make it easier for members to find movies, Netflix developed a personalized merchandising system.\nDuring this time, Netflix became famous for its Queue, a list of movies each household would create by hitting the “Add” button to add a title to an ordered list of movies. Each time a member returned a DVD, Netflix would send the title at the top of their Queue to their home.\n2000: Cinematch\nNetflix introduced a personalized movie recommendation system, using member ratings to predict how much a member would like a movie. The algorithm was called Cinematch, and it’s a collaborative filtering algorithm.\nHere’s an easy way to understand collaborative filtering: Imagine I like “Batman Begins” and “Breaking Bad,” and you like both, too. Because I like “Casino,” the algorithm suggests you’ll like “Casino.” Now, apply this approach across millions of members and titles.\n2001: The Five-Star Rating System\nNetflix created a five-star rating system and eventually collected billions of ratings from its members. Netflix experimented with multiple “star bars,” at times stacking the stars to indicate expected rating, average rating, and friends’ rating. (It was a mess.)\nThe stars represented how much a member would like a movie. If a member had watched the movie already, they could rate it. The red “Add” button added the movie to a member’s queue.\n\n2002: Multiple Algorithms\nBeyond Cinematch, three other algorithms worked together to merchandise movies:\n\nDynamic store. This algorithm indicated if the DVD was available to merchandise. Late in the DVD era, the algorithm also determined if a DVD was available in a member’s local hub. (By 2008, Netflix only merchandised locally available titles to increase the likelihood of next-day DVD delivery.)\nMetasims. Included all movie data available for each title — plot synopsis, director, actors, year, awards, language, etc.\nSearch. There was little investment in search in the early days as Netflix assumed members searched for expensive new release DVDs, making the company’s economics more challenging. But the team discovered that the titles members chose included lots of older, less expensive, long-tail titles, so they eventually ramped up investment in search.\n\nIn time, Netflix blended lots of other algorithms to execute its personalized merchandising system.\n2004: Profiles\nRecognizing multiple family members used a shared account, Netflix launched “Profiles.” This feature enabled each family member to generate its own movie list. It was a highly requested feature, but only two percent of members used it despite the aggressive promotion. It was a lot of work to manage an ordered list of DVDs, and only one person in each household was willing to do this.\nGiven the low adoption, Netflix announced its plan to kill the feature but capitulated in the face of member backlash. A small set of users cared deeply about the feature — they were afraid that losing Profiles would ruin their marriages. As an example of “all members are not created equal,” half the Netflix board used the feature.\n2004: Netflix Launches “Friends.”\nThe hypothesis: if you create a network of friends within Netflix, they’ll suggest great movie ideas to each other and won’t quit the service because they don’t want to leave their friends. At launch, 2% of Netflix members connected with at least one friend, but this metric never moved beyond 5%.\n\nNetflix killed the feature in 2010 as part of its discipline of “scraping barnacles” — removing features that members didn’t value. Unlike Profiles, there was no user revolt.\nTwo insights on social in the context of movies:\n\nYour friends have bad taste\nYou don’t want your friends to know all the movies you’re watching.\n\nThese are surprising insights during a decade when Facebook successfully applied its social strategy to many product categories.\n2006: The Netflix Personalization Strategy\nHere’s what the personalization strategy looked like in 2006:\n\nThe intent was to gather explicit and implicit data, then use various algorithms and presentation tactics to connect members with movies they’d love. The team focused on four main strategies:\n\nGather explicit taste data, including movie and TV show ratings, genre ratings, and demographic data.\nExplore implicit taste data like DVDs members added to their movie list or later, which movies members streamed.\nCreate algorithms and presentation layer tactics to connect members with movies they’ll love. Use the explicit/implicit taste data, along with lots of data about movies and TV shows (ratings, genres, synopsis, lead actors, directors, etc.), to create algorithms that connect members with titles. Also, create a simple user interface that provides visual support for personalized choices.\nImprove average movie ratings for each member by connecting them with better movies and TV shows.\n\nThe high-level hypothesis: personalization would improve retention by making it easy for members to find movies they’ll love.\nThe high-level engagement metric was retention. However, it takes years to affect this metric. So Netflix had a more sensitive, short-term proxy metric: The percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies during their first two months with the service.\nThe theory was that members would rate lots of movies to get better recommendations. These ratings signaled that members appreciated the personalized recommendations they received in return for their ratings. So the more ratings a member gave, the more they appreciated Netflix’s personalization.\nHere’s a rough snapshot of the improvement in this proxy metric over time:\nThe early proxy metric for Netflix’s personalization efforts was the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies or TV shows during their first two months with the service.\nWhy the 2011 dip in the metric? By this time, most members streamed movies, and Netflix had a strong implicit signal about member taste. Once you hit the “Play” button, you either kept watching or stopped. Netflix no longer needed to collect as many star ratings.\nIt took Netflix more than a decade to demonstrate that a personalized experience improved retention. But consistent growth in this proxy metric convinced the company to keep doubling down on personalization until many years later, Netflix proved that personalization improved retention in a large-scale retention test.\n2006: The Ratings Wizard\nThe original petri dish for personalization was an area on the site with a “Recommendations” tab. But testing revealed that members preferred less prescriptive language. The new tab had a “Movies You’ll Heart” tab that generated lots of clicks. The design team thought the tab was “fugly,” but it worked.\nWhen members arrived at the “Movies You’ll Heart” area, the site introduced them to the “Ratings Wizard”:\n\nMembers “binge-rated” while they waited for their DVDs to arrive. The Ratings Wizard was critical in moving the “percentage of members who rate at least 50 movies in their first two months” proxy metric. While members rated lots of movies using the “star bar” throughout the site, the Ratings Wizard was the major source of taste input.\n2006: Demographic Data\nNetflix collected age and gender data from its members, but when the team used demographics to inform predictions about a member’s movie taste, the algorithms did not improve predictive power. Huh?\nHow did Netflix measure predictive power? The proxy metric for the personalization algorithms was RMSE (Root Mean Squared-Error) — a calculation that measures the delta between the algorithm’s predicted rating and a member’s actual rating. If Netflix predicted you would like “Friends” and “Seinfeld” four and five stars respectively, and you rated these shows four and five stars, the prediction was perfect. RMSE is a “down and to the right” metric that improved over time, mainly through improvements in the collaborative filtering algorithm. You can see the improvements, over time, in the graph below:\nRoot Mean Squared Error was a calculation of the predicted v. actual ratings for all Netflix members. It’s a “down and to the right” metric that got better over time.\nUnfortunately, age and gender data did not improve predictions — there was no improvement in RMSE. Movie tastes are hard to predict as they are idiosyncratic — they are very peculiar and vary radically from one individual to another. Knowing my age and gender doesn’t help predict my movie tastes. It’s much more helpful to know just a few movies or TV shows I like.\nTo see this insight in action today, create a new profile on your Netflix account. Netflix asks you for a few titles you like to kickstart the personalization system. That’s all they need to seed the system.\n2006: Collaborative Filtering in the QUACL\nThe QUACL is the Queue Add Confirmation Layer. Once a member added a title to their Queue, a confirmation layer would pop up suggesting similar titles. Below, a member has added “Eiken” to their movie list, and the collaborative filtering algorithm suggests six similar titles:\n\nOver time, Netflix got better at suggesting similar titles for members to add to their queue, which drove this merchandising source from ten to fifteen percent of total queue adds over a few years. The QUACL was a great test environment for algorithm testing. In fact, Netflix executed some of its first machine learning tests within the QUACL.\n2006: The $1M Netflix Prize\nLike any startup, Netflix had limited resources. They had proven the value of “Cinematch” but had only one engineer focused on the algorithm. The solution: outsource the problem via The Netflix Prize.\nNetflix offered $1 Million to any team that could improve RMSE by at least 10%.\nNetflix offered a million-dollar prize to any team that improved RMSE for their “Cinematch” algorithm by ten percent. The personalization team provided anonymized data from their members as training data for the teams, along with a second dataset that included members’ actual ratings so teams could test their algorithms’ predictive power. It took two years for teams to win the money — more on that in a moment.\n2007: Netflix Streaming Launch\nNetflix launched streaming in 2007. It was a free add-on for the DVD-by-mail service—the first streaming-only service launched in Canada in 2010.\nNetflix launched streaming in January 2007. For the first time, the Netflix team had real-time data about what movies members watched, where before, they only had DVD rental activity. Over time, this implicit data became more important in predicting members’ movie tastes than the explicit data Netflix collected via its five-star rating system.\nAt the time of streaming launch in 2007, Netflix had nearly 100,000 DVDs to choose from, so the DVD merchandising challenge was to help members find “hidden gems” from its huge DVD library. However, with streaming, the challenge was to help members identify a few movies they’d find worthwhile among the three hundred mediocre titles available at launch.\n2007: Netflix Prize\nThe “Netflix Prize” offered $1 million to any team that could improve the predictive power of Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm by 10%, as measured by RMSE, the delta between expected and actual rating for each movie. Two years later, “Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos” finally won the contest, beating 5,000 other teams.\nThere were two insights from the contest:\n\nAll ratings are not created equal. Contestants discovered that the ratings members provided for recent movies provided more predictive power than older ratings.\nThe more algorithms, the better. At the end of each year, Netflix paid a $50,000 progress prize to the leading team. On the final day of the year, the teams in second and third place combined their algorithms and vaulted to the top of the leaderboard to take the progress prize. That’s how teams learned the importance of combining lots of algorithms. (That’s also why the team names were so strange — when teams combined their work, they created “mashup” names.)\n\nAfter two years, the top team delivered a 10.06% increase in RMSE to win the million-dollar prize. “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” submitted its winning algorithm twenty-four minutes before the second-place team, “The Ensemble.” The two teams had identical scores, but “BellKor” submitted their entry first. Here’s the final leaderboard:\nThe leaderboard for the Netflix Prize at its conclusion in 2009. “Opera Solutions and Vandelay United” was the combined submission of three teams, including an insider’s joke from “Seinfeld.”\n2009: The Next Big Netflix Prize\nWhen Netflix announced the winners of its first competition, it launched a second round. The new challenge was to use demographics and rental behavior to make better predictions. The algorithms could consider a member’s age, gender, ZIP code, and full rental history.\nWhen Netflix released anonymized customer information to start the second round, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in with a lawsuit contending that the data wasn’t sufficiently anonymized. As part of the March 2010 settlement for that suit, Netflix canceled the second round.\n2010: Testing the New “Netflix Prize” Algorithm\nNetflix launched the Netflix Prize contest to provide better movie choices for members, which the team hoped would translate into retention improvement. But when Netflix executed the new algorithm in a large-scale A/B test, there was no measurable retention difference. It was a disappointing result.\nA new hypothesis emerged. To improve retention, you needed better algorithms plus presentation layer tactics that provided context for why Netflix chose a specific title for each member, as follows:\n\nBetter algorithms + UI/design support/context = improved retention.\n\nWas it worth $1 million to execute the contest? Absolutely. The recruiting benefit alone made it worthwhile. Before the Netflix Prize, engineers considered Netflix just another e-commerce company. After the prize, they regarded Netflix as a highly innovative company.\n2010: Popularity Matters\nNetflix published all of its learnings from the Netflix Prize, and other companies studied the results. The music streaming service Pandora, whose personalization efforts focused on its “Music Genome Project,” was wary of weighting its algorithms with popularity. Instead, Pandora had forty “musicologists” who tagged each song with hundreds of attributes to explain why a listener would like a song. For example, musicologists tagged Jack Johnson’s songs as “optimistic, folksy, acoustic music with surfing, outdoor adventure, and coming of age themes.”\nBut as Pandora evaluated the results of the Netflix Prize (which weighted popularity highly), they began to execute collaborative filtering algorithms, too. These changes improved Pandora’s listening metrics. Pandora’s conclusion: popularity matters.\n2011: Netflix’s Movie Genome Project\nWhile admiring Pandora’s work and knowing that “the more algorithms, the better,” Netflix began to develop its own “movie genome” project, hiring thirty “moviecologists” to tag various attributes of movies and TV shows.\nAs a reminder, Netflix’s collaborative filtering algorithm predicts you’ll like a movie, but the algorithm can’t provide context for why you’ll like it. The Cinematch collaborative filtering algorithm leads to statements like, “Because you like Batman Begins and Breaking Bad, we think you’ll like Sesame Street.” Wait, what?\nNetflix’s new movie genome algorithm is called “Category Interest.” Now, for the first time, Netflix can suggest a movie and give context for why a member might like it. In the example below, Netflix knows I like Airplane, and Heathers, so suggests Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and The Breakfast Club because I like “Cult Comedies from the 1980s”:\nEarly execution of the “Category Interest” algorithm, circa 2011.\nThe “Category Interest” algorithm improved Netflix’s watching metrics — the percentage of members who watched at least forty hours a month — but the team did not execute an A/B test to see if it improved retention.\n2011: How the Personalization Algorithms Work\nIn simplest terms, Netflix creates a forced rank list of movies for each user — from the content most likely to please to the least. Then this list is filtered, sliced, and diced according to attributes of the movies, TV shows, and the member’s tastes. For instance, a filter teases out a sub-list of movies and presents it in a row called “Quirky dramas with strong female heroines” or “Witty, irreverent TV shows.” Other rows might be titled, “Because You Watched Stranger Things, We Think You’ll Enjoy…” or “Top 10 for You.”\nNetflix’s personalization approach has three components:\n\nA forced-rank list of titles for each member\nAn understanding of the most relevant filters for each member so the algorithms can present a subset of movies and TV shows from the list above, and\nThe ability to understand the most relevant rows for each member, depending on the platform, time of day, and lots of explicit/implicit movie taste data.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that these rows, with appropriate context, can be displayed on any device or screen. It’s easy to display this same row structure on all browsers and devices.\n2011: Netflix Proves Personalization Improved Retention\nFinally, In 2011, Netflix demonstrated a retention improvement in a large A/B test. However, the results were controversial as the test compared the default personalized experience to a dumbed-down experience with no personalization. Netflix engineers complained the test was a waste of time. By this time, most of the team accepted that personalization created a better experience for Netflix members.\nRecognize that Netflix had made a very long-term, thirteen-year “leap of faith” investment in personalization until they finally had “proof” of retention improvement in 2011. But improvements in the proxy metric — the percentage of members who rated at least 50 movies in their first two months with the service — gave Netflix the confidence to consistently “double down” on personalization.\n2012: Profiles Re-invented\nAs Netflix moved beyond DVDs, it no longer required members to create an ordered list of movies. Instead, members hit the “Play” button to begin watching a movie or TV show.\nNetflix had a profile feature during the DVD era, but only 2% of members used the feature, mainly because managing this forced-rank list of movies was time-consuming. But now, there’s nothing to manage. You provide Netflix with your name, three movies, or TV shows you enjoy, and Netflix creates a personalized experience for each user associated with that account.\nToday, more than half of Netflix accounts have multiple profiles. Netflix knows the movie tastes for 200 million accounts, translating into an understanding of the movie tastes of 500 million separate movie-watchers.\n2013: “House of Cards” Original Content Launch\nHouse of Cards, Netflix’s first big investment in original content, was actually an American remake of the British TV Series.\nIn 2007, during the DVD era, Netflix’s first original content effort, Red Envelope Studios, failed. Despite this failure, Netflix tried again during the streaming era.\nKnowing that millions of members liked Kevin Spacey and The West Wing, Netflix made an initial $100M bet on House of Cards, which paid off. Over six seasons, Netflix invested more than $500 million in the series. House of Cards was the first of many successful original movies and television series.\nBy this time in Netflix’s history, it’s clear that personalization delights customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. By making movies easier to find, Netflix improves retention, which increases lifetime value (LTV). And Netflix’s personalization technology is tough to copy, especially at scale.\nBut there’s another aspect of personalization that improves the company’s margin: the ability for Netflix to “right-size” their content spend. Here are examples of Netflix’s right-sizing with my best estimates on content investments:\n\nBased on its knowledge of member tastes, Netflix predicts that 100 million members will watch Stranger Things and invests $500 million in the series.\nFor a quirkier adult cartoon, Bojack Horseman, the data science team predicts 20 million watchers, so they invest $100 million in this animated TV series.\nBased on a prediction that one million members will watch Everest climbing documentaries, Netflix invests $5 million in this genre.\n\nNetflix has a huge advantage in its ability to right-size its original content investment, fueled by its ability to forecast how many members will watch a specific movie, documentary, or TV show. Note: Netflix does not bring data-driven approaches to the movie creation process — they are hands-off with creators.\n2013: Netflix wins a Technical Emmy\nIn 2013, Netflix won an Emmy award for “Personalized Recommendation Engines For Video Discovery.” This award hints at the degree to which Netflix will eventually dominate the Oscars, Emmy’s, and Golden Globe Awards for its original content.\n2015: Does It Matter if You’re French?\nA Netflix PC-based homepage, en francais.\nFrom 2015 to 2021, Netflix expanded from twenty to forty languages, as they launched their service into 190 countries. The personalization team wondered if they should inform the personalization algorithms with each member’s native language and country. The short answer, based on the results of A/B testing: “No.”\nLike the demographics test in 2006, members’ tastes are so idiosyncratic that language and geography don’t help predict a member’s movie preferences. As before, the most efficient way to seed a member’s taste profile is to ask for a few TV shows or movies they love. Over time, Netflix builds from this “seed” as it informs its algorithms with the titles members rate, watch, stop watching, and even demonstrate an interest in by clicking on the “Movie Display Page” or watching a preview.\n2016: Netflix Tests a Personalized Interface\nSome of the cultural values of Netflix are curiosity, candor, and courage. Netflix encourages new employees to challenge conventional wisdom when they join the company. Netflix appreciates the value of “fresh eyes” and encourages an iconoclastic culture.\nA newly hired product leader at Netflix suggested that the team test “floating rows.” The idea was that rows like “Top 10 for Gib,” “Just Released,” and “Continue Watching” should be different for each member and even change depending on the device, time of day, and other factors. Conventional wisdom suggested an inconsistent site design would confuse and annoy customers, so it’s better to keep the interface consistent. But the “old guard” allowed the newbie to test it anyway.\nAs Ralph Waldon Emerson once said, “Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.” Surprisingly, the inconsistent interface performed better in AB tests. Today, even the user interface is personalized based on member’s taste preferences.\nNote that row names that Netflix presents to you are wildly inconsistent. In this screen capture for me on PC, Netflix leads with a row entitled “Trending Now” and puts the “Continue Watching” row in the second position. The interface changes each time you use it, depending on your recent activity, platform, and even time of day.\n2017: From Stars to Thumbs\nBy 2017, Netflix collected more than 5 billion star ratings. But over the last ten years, Facebook popularized a different rating system — thumbs up and down. By 2017, Facebook had introduced this simple gesture to more than two billion users worldwide.\nDiscovering which method inspires members to provide more taste data is simple: execute an A/B test of the five-star system against a thumbs up/down system. The result: the simpler thumbs system collected twice as many ratings.\nIn 2017, Netflix tested its five-star ratings system against Facebook’s “Thumbs Up/Down” interface. “Thumbs” doubled the amount of taste input from members.\nWas this a surprising result? No. When you require a member to parse between three, four, or five stars, you force them to think too much. They become confounded and move on to the next activity without rating a movie. Clicking thumbs up or down is much easier. Here, as in many cases with user interfaces, simple trumps complete.\n2017: What Happens to The Five-Star System?\nIf stars are gone, how do you communicate movie quality? Recall that one of Netflix’s early hypotheses was that, over time, the average ratings of the movies watched would increase, leading to improved retention. While there was evidence that average ratings increased, nothing in the Netflix data sets suggested that higher average ratings improved retention.\nIt turns out that movie ratings do not equal movie enjoyment. While you may appreciate that Schindler’s List or Hotel Rwanda are five-star movies, it doesn’t mean you enjoy them more than a three-star movie. Sometimes a “leave your brains at the door” comedy like Paul Blart’s Mall Cop is all you need. This is the reason that one of Netflix’s first big investments in original content was a six-picture deal with Adam Sandler, the king of sophomoric comedy. My favorite? The Ridiculous Six.\nThis was one of six titles in Adam Sandler’s six picture original content deal. Sometimes movie enjoyment is all about leaving your brains at the door with a good three-star movie.\n2017: Percentage Match\nSo, with the loss of star ratings, and the insight that star ratings do not equal movie enjoyment, Netflix changed its system. They switched to a “percentage match” that indicated how much you would enjoy a movie, irrespective of its quality.\nBelow, Netflix gives an “80% Match” for me for The Irishman. There’s an 80% chance I will enjoy it, which is at the low-end for Netflix suggestions for me.\nNetflix no longer indicates the quality of a movie with its five-star movie system. It simply indicates the extent to which a title is a match for you, giving an indication of how much they think you will enjoy it.\n2018: Personalized Movie Art\nThe Netflix personalization team wants to present you with the right title at the right time with as much context as possible to encourage you to watch that title. To do this, Netflix uses personalized visuals that cater to each member’s taste preferences. Here’s more from the Netflix tech blog:\nLet us consider trying to personalize the image we use to depict the movie Good Will Hunting. Here we might personalize this decision based on how much a member prefers different genres and themes. Someone who has watched many romantic movies may be interested in Good Will Hunting if we show the artwork containing Matt Damon and Minnie Driver, whereas, a member who has watched many comedies might be drawn to the movie if we use the artwork containing Robin Williams, a well-known comedian.\nUsing the example above, the Netflix tech blog shares the titles that support each scenario, along with the unique movie art that Netflix presents to different members. The top row supports a member interested in romantic movies, with the image of Matt Damon and Minnie Driver as the hero. The bottom row is for members who enjoy watching well-known comedians. In that example, Robin Williams is featured.\nIf. you’re Into romantic comedies, Netflix uses the top-right movie art when it merchandises GoodWill Hunting to you. If you like famous comedians, your personalized movie art features Robin Williams.\nNot only does Netflix use its knowledge of member taste to choose the right movie, but it takes member tastes into account to support these choices through highly personalized visuals.\n2021: Do you feel lucky?\nThe ultimate personalization is you turn on your TV, and Netflix magically plays a movie you’ll love. Netflix’s first experiment with this concept is a feature that the company co-CEO, Reed Hastings (jokingly), called the “I feel lucky” button.\n\nYou will note when you sign onto your profile on a TV-based system, there’s a new “Play Something” button. Think of this button as a proxy for how well Netflix algorithms connect members with movies they’ll love. I’d guess that 2–3% of the plays come from this button today. If this “Play Something” button generates ten percent usage a few years from now, it’s a strong indication that Netflix personalization is doing a better job connecting its members with movies they’ll love.\nHere’s the long-term personalization vision: twenty years from now, Netflix will eliminate both the “Play Something” button and its personalized merchandising system, and that one special movie you’re in the mood to watch at that particular moment will automatically begin to play.\nMy guess is that Netflix will achieve this vision within twenty years. They’ve come a long way in the last twenty years, so I think this is feasible.\nConclusion\nToday, more than 80% of the TV shows and movies that Netflix members watch are merchandised to you by Netflix’s personalization algorithms.\nNetflix’s personalization journey has had its share of ups and downs. But eventually, personalization enabled Netflix to build a hard-to-copy technological advantage that delights customers in margin-enhancing ways.\nFor product leaders engaged in innovative projects, Netflix’s journey highlights the need for:\n\na plan — a product strategy with accompanying metrics and tactics\na method to quickly test various hypotheses, and\na culture that encourages risk-taking, intellectual curiosity, candor, plus the courage to say, “Let’s try this idea.”\n\nThe last requirement: patience. It takes decades to build a world-class product and company.\nOne Last Thing!\nIf you have a moment, I’d love your feedback on this essay. Click here to give me feedback.

This is Part 2 of the “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@James_Wang-Product/becoming-a-product-leader-introduction-3410931eb7ce\">Becoming a Product Leader</a>” series. In this series, I’m tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to move towards becoming a Product Leader.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/968/1*zmh14wicae9Ngm6nel_W-A.png\" /></figure><h3>Leading Complex Initiatives</h3><p>As a Product Leader, you will be expected to lead and drive initiatives that span across an organization. So the potential impact you can have on the business— either positive or negative — increase commensurately. Your leadership team, stakeholders, and individuals doing the work all need to trust that your influence will result in better outcomes.</p><p>And nothing proves the ability to drive major business impact like past success. So it’s important for individual contributor PMs seeking to become Product Leaders to take opportunities to drive complex initiatives.</p><p>What this looks like varies a lot by the company and organization you’re in. But initiatives and projects led by Product Leaders tend to need major coordination and alignment. They’ll work with more leaders and more stakeholders than what’s expected at the team level.</p><p>Examples of scope for a team level Product Manager vs. a Product Leader:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4vxO9ovG34piowALUmjLLA.png\" /></figure><p>Look at what other product leaders are responsible for compared to team level PMs at your company. Within Autodesk Construction Solutions (ACS), PMs are responsible for their individual product areas. There’s still a lot of cross-organizational collaboration, but they tend to stay relatively focused. Group PMs or Directors will lead initiatives that need delivery from many teams or even the entire organization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kky--s45PmBXOnDg6bdf7g.png\" /></figure><h4>Big scary initiatives and the fear of failure</h4><p>I took on the responsibility to define a strategy for an initiative with complex technical tradeoffs and without clarity on the exact customer needs. I’m going to be a bit vague, so I apologize if this isn’t perfectly clear. But essentially, we realized that within next couple planning cycles, we were going to face serious sales and development challenges if we didn’t come up with a compelling story and proper solution.</p><p>A fully built solution would require months of development effort from almost every team in our organization. No one else wanted to even look at this; we were all still busy just grinding away at our immediate goals. But we needed a plan.</p><p>I hesitated to take this on. This initiative had the potential to get very complicated, very quickly. There was little data available, and no good way to talk to customers about it at the time. Getting involved could mean staying involved for a long time. And at any step in this process, I’d run a risk of failure or embarrassment.</p><p>But it needed to be done, and it was exactly the kind of complex, ambiguous problems that other Product Leaders in my organization were facing. And it was a really interesting problem to solve. So I decided to take on the responsibility.</p><p>In leading this initiative, I was able to collaborate with leaders across R&amp;D and GTM teams that I would never have otherwise worked with. I learned a lot about our products and the customer and business needs driving this initiative. And I continuously presented our evolving approach and our plans to the leadership team, eventually getting buy in on a strategy.</p><p>Together, we were able to formulate a phased approach that allowed us to build incrementally towards a full solution, while having time to evaluate and make changes to the plan as we progressed. This plan is actually still evolving and ongoing, and code is starting to be shipped.</p><p>One of the key things I learned from this experience was that with big, scary, complicated initiatives, people appreciate someone stepping up to try and make sense of things. It didn’t matter that I didn’t have the best experience or that I was learning as I went.</p><p>Another takeaway was that with large enough initiatives, even just creating alignment on a plan is a major outcome. Shipping code and impacting customers is still the goal, but the challenge to get so many folks pointed in the same direction is significant, and other leaders recognize it.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/722/1*kHD43jIuntKdmbhgPqc68g.png\" /></figure><h4>Ideas into action</h4><p>As an individual Product Manager, look for opportunities to tackle complex initiatives outside of your immediate team level responsibilities.</p><p>If you’re working on an existing product that’s stable, are there big new market opportunities that you could extend towards? Building a strong business case is a great project. You collaborate with other product managers, marketing, sales, and research and data. Best case scenario, you get approval, build it, and drive a huge win for the business. Worst case, you learn a lot, build relationships, and demonstrate bigger picture thinking and impact.</p><p>Or is there a big gap between product visions that needs a coherent narrative? You can help create a powerful story that unites the organization and builds excitement with leadership and stakeholders. And in driving that alignment, you can create better business outcomes.</p><p>Look for opportunities to step outside of your individual team and work. Talk to your manager, the leadership team, and even senior stakeholders to learn about what kinds of problems are looming and need a leader to champion. Yes, it’s more work, and no it’s not required. It may not go anywhere outside of a document or presentation. But that’s the work of a Product Leader — lots of exploration, alignment, and bets that sometimes pay off and often don’t.</p><h3>Organization-Wide Strategy</h3><p>Product strategy drives business outcomes. As a Product Leader, you will be expected to define, align, and drive strategy across an organization. Product Managers are often thinking about strategy and prioritization for their team’s backlog. Whether in planning cycles or in grooming the backlog, they should always be able to explain why the team is doing what they’re doing. Yet PMs often don’t take the time to articulate a clear strategy when making their plans.</p><p>So, two questions to discuss: “how does one define product strategy?” and “how does one lead strategy across an organization?”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/786/1*LdFi1MsYW745c6fq9jxJ0w.png\" /></figure><h4>Defining Product Strategy</h4><p>Jackie Bavaro and Gayle Laakmann in <a href=\"https://www.crackingthepmcareer.com/\"><em>Cracking the PM Career</em></a> did a fantastic job defining strategy. To briefly summarize their thinking, product strategy has three components:</p><ul><li>Product vision</li><li>Strategic framework</li><li>Roadmap</li></ul><p>Most Product Managers are familiar with selling a vision and creating a roadmap. A lot of PMs skip the strategic framework.</p><p>The product vision is the high level, inspiring description for where the product can go. It’s often aspirational and excites folks with what the future holds. PMs don’t always spend a lot of time building a grand vision, but they can usually explain where the product is going over the next 2–3 years.</p><p>The roadmap is just a list of things you say you’ll be working on. Whether a high level backlog, or a rough timeline of initiatives. It’s what most stakeholders are asking for. When are we going to satisfy this customer request? What’s going in our big quarterly marketing push? But a roadmap by itself doesn’t say anything much about meaningful goals and outcomes.</p><p>The strategic framework is the missing piece in most PM’s plans. It answers the questions of “why this list of initiatives,” and “how are we going to achieve our vision?”</p><p>Key considerations for your strategic framework:</p><ul><li>What are the major goals you are trying to achieve?</li><li>What customers are you targeting with your goals?</li><li>What business impact do you believe these goals will have?</li><li>How do the goals align with the broader organizational strategy?</li><li>How do the goals tie into your broader vision?</li></ul><p>The goals should explain the building blocks that form the vision, as well as the business outcomes that justify the investment over time.</p><p>However you create the framework, the key is that the strategic framework answers questions on why work is worth doing.</p><p>I have a simple template that I’ve shared with the PMs in my group. It’s designed to drive alignment with other teams, and explain the prioritization of our roadmap. This is helpful, as we have a lot of dependencies with other teams, and work often gets delayed. When push comes to shove, our framework makes it clear what work can or can’t get cut.</p><ul><li>Goals: What do we plan to accomplish this half? How will things be different for our customers or our organization as a result of what we do this half? How are we aligning with or supporting broader organization wide goals and direction?</li><li>Strategy: How will we do the above? Who are we focusing on? What are we prioritizing as a must have, a nice to have, a won’t do?</li><li>Milestones: Are there incremental wins we can deliver along the way? What types of initiatives and timeline would enable these incremental goals?</li></ul><p>Each initiative in our roadmap can be tied to a specific goals, milestone, and strategic priority.</p><p>I’ve found this framework to be very helpful when presenting to our leadership team and to stakeholders. A vision by itself is an empty promise. A list of initiatives by itself explains nothing. The framework provides a meaningful plan and creates context for what we’re building. It sells the <em>why</em>, the story behind what we plan to build and where we’re going.</p><h4>Driving Strategy Across an Organization</h4><p>Product leadership in strategy is about defining, aligning, and selling a broader strategy across an organization. An organization wide strategy should instill confidence that everyone is working together towards bigger outcomes. It should empower teams to define their own strategies, aligning with organization-wide outcomes.</p><p>Two major considerations:</p><ul><li>Driving alignment with other leaders and stakeholders</li><li>Providing the right level of guidance to teams</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zZw9O4dLnde1kJ31WK_LZQ.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Aligning with other leaders and stakeholders</strong></h4><p>This is a common thread with any kind of Product Leadership activity. You’re impacting a broader scope, and more people and teams are impacted and have opinions. Likewise, you’re interacting with and dependent on more outside teams. Driving this alignment needs to happen constantly, not just during planning cycles.</p><p>Building alignment and excitement early on increases the likelihood that your plan will be supported and resourced and your vision realized.</p><p>I was leading a team to discover a new product opportunity. We wanted to start small — focus on a single step in a larger workflow, and build a case to expand. But it was clear that customers were going to want more connections with other products in ACS. My initial instinct was to hand-wave the longer term opportunity so I could focus on the hard work of validating the immediate MVP. But I realized — with advice from others — that this was an opportunity. I could build more excitement for the opportunity and demonstrate leadership across a broad product area.</p><p>Over several months I collaborated with many other team leads to build a shared understanding of our products and visions. We brainstormed long term opportunities to create more powerful workflows for customers. This culminated in stories we could tell in product specs and presentation. Driving and engaging in these conversations built a lot of excitement. Leadership and our sales and marketing partners saw the opportunity, and our MVP proposal was green-lit. And I learned a lot about collaborating on a broader vision with other leaders.</p><h4><strong>Providing guidance to teams</strong></h4><p>Good strategic guidance aligns teams toward shared goals. By aligning teams towards specific goals and outcomes, you can drive greater business impact. Crushing three goals will have a lot more impact than barely touching ten goals. Effective guidance clarifies priorities. It answers questions for an organization that teams can’t easily answer for themselves. But it leaves space for teams to define their own problems and solutions.</p><p>In a recent planning process, I worked with several other leads to form a coherent strategy for our part of the business unit. We discussed what made our product area unique and what we saw as long term opportunities for our products, within the broader context of the Autodesk Construction Cloud. With this, we were able to agree on a high level vision for our product area.</p><p>We defined strategic pillars that supported our vision, aligning directly to each of the organizational goals set by our leadership team. Each of these pillars was a long term opportunity of investment, with increasing maturity levels. We defined maturity levels on an axis of manual effort to automation and insights. Essentially, does this work flow exist, how easy is it to complete this workflow, can steps in this workflow happen automatically, and can we predict steps or provide insights for this workflow?</p><p>A key insight was realizing that over-investment in one pillar’s maturity at the expense of another could create an unbalanced experience that didn’t satisfy a significant portion of customers. Every pillar mattered, and we wanted to make continuous, meaningful progress along the maturity axis for each pillar.</p><p>Each team in our broader group is responsible for specific features and pieces of each workflow that we own holistically. By creating this framework, we were able to provide more transparency across the group as to how far along each team was for each pillar.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1020/1*-hMuXpjl8CRtpjU2VXAi1g.png\" /></figure><p>This made it easier to identify strengths and gaps to be closed, in order to create a more consistent approach across our portfolio of products.</p><p>With this high level framework, we left a lot of room for teams to define how they’d achieve these goals. But they also had clarity on how to define team level strategies that would align across our group and with the broader organizational goals.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/722/1*kHD43jIuntKdmbhgPqc68g.png\" /></figure><h4>Ideas into Actions</h4><p>If you haven’t yet, define a clear product strategy for your team. You should be able to articulate how each initiative ties to your product goals. Each product goal should serve a higher level organizational or business goal. You should be clear on who you’re building for, and why you’re prioritizing them over other customers or users. You should be able to quickly determine what work must get completed this half and what can be pushed out. Answer the questions listed above, and answer any questions that your team and stakeholders ask.</p><p>Once you’ve defined a compelling strategy for your team, start looking outward. Look for broader strategic narratives that you can create with other teams. Help your product leaders craft the broader strategies by coming with data or research insights. Go and talk to other teams about what they’re building towards, and raise awareness of misalignments or opportunities.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Being a product leader requires driving bigger product and business outcomes. Individual team level focus isn’t enough. Find opportunities to take on initiatives that impact multiple teams. Collaborate with others on strategy and vision beyond your own product area. Find ways to prove that you can work with others to move the business.</p><p>Remember that the goal isn’t do everything or to do it all perfectly. It’s about learning how to increase the scope and impact of your actions. Working across a broader section of your organization and with more leaders will provide you with new challenges and problems to overcome. Maintaining a good attitude and focusing on learning will carry you a long way.</p><p><strong>Coming soon</strong> — Part 3: Establishing Excellence in Product Management.</p><p><em>Please share your thoughts in the comments!

PMs don’t always spend a lot of time building a grand vision, but they can usually explain where the product is going over the next 2–3 years.\nThe roadmap is just a list of things you say you’ll be working on. Whether a high level backlog, or a rough timeline of initiatives. It’s what most stakeholders are asking for. When are we going to satisfy this customer request? What’s going in our big quarterly marketing push? But a roadmap by itself doesn’t say anything much about meaningful goals and outcomes.\nThe strategic framework is the missing piece in most PM’s plans. It answers the questions of “why this list of initiatives,” and “how are we going to achieve our vision?”\nKey considerations for your strategic framework:\n\nWhat are the major goals you are trying to achieve?\nWhat customers are you targeting with your goals?\nWhat business impact do you believe these goals will have?\nHow do the goals align with the broader organizational strategy?\nHow do the goals tie into your broader vision?\n\nThe goals should explain the building blocks that form the vision, as well as the business outcomes that justify the investment over time.\nHowever you create the framework, the key is that the strategic framework answers questions on why work is worth doing.\nI have a simple template that I’ve shared with the PMs in my group. It’s designed to drive alignment with other teams, and explain the prioritization of our roadmap. This is helpful, as we have a lot of dependencies with other teams, and work often gets delayed. When push comes to shove, our framework makes it clear what work can or can’t get cut.\n\nGoals: What do we plan to accomplish this half? How will things be different for our customers or our organization as a result of what we do this half? How are we aligning with or supporting broader organization wide goals and direction?\nStrategy: How will we do the above? Who are we focusing on? What are we prioritizing as a must have, a nice to have, a won’t do?\nMilestones: Are there incremental wins we can deliver along the way? What types of initiatives and timeline would enable these incremental goals?\n\nEach initiative in our roadmap can be tied to a specific goals, milestone, and strategic priority.\nI’ve found this framework to be very helpful when presenting to our leadership team and to stakeholders. A vision by itself is an empty promise. A list of initiatives by itself explains nothing. The framework provides a meaningful plan and creates context for what we’re building. It sells the why, the story behind what we plan to build and where we’re going.\nDriving Strategy Across an Organization\nProduct leadership in strategy is about defining, aligning, and selling a broader strategy across an organization. An organization wide strategy should instill confidence that everyone is working together towards bigger outcomes. It should empower teams to define their own strategies, aligning with organization-wide outcomes.\nTwo major considerations:\n\nDriving alignment with other leaders and stakeholders\nProviding the right level of guidance to teams\n\nAligning with other leaders and stakeholders\nThis is a common thread with any kind of Product Leadership activity. You’re impacting a broader scope, and more people and teams are impacted and have opinions. Likewise, you’re interacting with and dependent on more outside teams. Driving this alignment needs to happen constantly, not just during planning cycles.\nBuilding alignment and excitement early on increases the likelihood that your plan will be supported and resourced and your vision realized.\nI was leading a team to discover a new product opportunity. We wanted to start small — focus on a single step in a larger workflow, and build a case to expand. But it was clear that customers were going to want more connections with other products in ACS. My initial instinct was to hand-wave the longer term opportunity so I could focus on the hard work of validating the immediate MVP. But I realized — with advice from others — that this was an opportunity. I could build more excitement for the opportunity and demonstrate leadership across a broad product area.\nOver several months I collaborated with many other team leads to build a shared understanding of our products and visions. We brainstormed long term opportunities to create more powerful workflows for customers. This culminated in stories we could tell in product specs and presentation. Driving and engaging in these conversations built a lot of excitement. Leadership and our sales and marketing partners saw the opportunity, and our MVP proposal was green-lit. And I learned a lot about collaborating on a broader vision with other leaders.\nProviding guidance to teams\nGood strategic guidance aligns teams toward shared goals. By aligning teams towards specific goals and outcomes, you can drive greater business impact. Crushing three goals will have a lot more impact than barely touching ten goals. Effective guidance clarifies priorities. It answers questions for an organization that teams can’t easily answer for themselves. But it leaves space for teams to define their own problems and solutions.\nIn a recent planning process, I worked with several other leads to form a coherent strategy for our part of the business unit. We discussed what made our product area unique and what we saw as long term opportunities for our products, within the broader context of the Autodesk Construction Cloud. With this, we were able to agree on a high level vision for our product area.\nWe defined strategic pillars that supported our vision, aligning directly to each of the organizational goals set by our leadership team. Each of these pillars was a long term opportunity of investment, with increasing maturity levels. We defined maturity levels on an axis of manual effort to automation and insights. Essentially, does this work flow exist, how easy is it to complete this workflow, can steps in this workflow happen automatically, and can we predict steps or provide insights for this workflow?\nA key insight was realizing that over-investment in one pillar’s maturity at the expense of another could create an unbalanced experience that didn’t satisfy a significant portion of customers. Every pillar mattered, and we wanted to make continuous, meaningful progress along the maturity axis for each pillar.\nEach team in our broader group is responsible for specific features and pieces of each workflow that we own holistically. By creating this framework, we were able to provide more transparency across the group as to how far along each team was for each pillar.\n\nThis made it easier to identify strengths and gaps to be closed, in order to create a more consistent approach across our portfolio of products.\nWith this high level framework, we left a lot of room for teams to define how they’d achieve these goals. But they also had clarity on how to define team level strategies that would align across our group and with the broader organizational goals.\n\nIdeas into Actions\nIf you haven’t yet, define a clear product strategy for your team. You should be able to articulate how each initiative ties to your product goals. Each product goal should serve a higher level organizational or business goal. You should be clear on who you’re building for, and why you’re prioritizing them over other customers or users. You should be able to quickly determine what work must get completed this half and what can be pushed out. Answer the questions listed above, and answer any questions that your team and stakeholders ask.\nOnce you’ve defined a compelling strategy for your team, start looking outward. Look for broader strategic narratives that you can create with other teams. Help your product leaders craft the broader strategies by coming with data or research insights. Go and talk to other teams about what they’re building towards, and raise awareness of misalignments or opportunities.\nSummary\nBeing a product leader requires driving bigger product and business outcomes. Individual team level focus isn’t enough. Find opportunities to take on initiatives that impact multiple teams. Collaborate with others on strategy and vision beyond your own product area. Find ways to prove that you can work with others to move the business.\nRemember that the goal isn’t do everything or to do it all perfectly. It’s about learning how to increase the scope and impact of your actions. Working across a broader section of your organization and with more leaders will provide you with new challenges and problems to overcome. Maintaining a good attitude and focusing on learning will carry you a long way.\nComing soon — Part 3: Establishing Excellence in Product Management.\nPlease share your thoughts in the comments!

After a string of <em>thock thock</em> keystrokes, the 12-inch Sanyo monitor began to phosphoresce. A green grid appeared, 16 units wide and 16 units tall. This was “Gridmaster,” a program Bruce had cooked up in the programming language BASIC to build one of the world’s first Chinese digital fonts. He was developing the font for an experimental machine called the Sinotype III, which was among the first personal computers to handle Chinese-language input and output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were no personal computers being built in China. So to make a “Chinese” PC, Rosenblum’s team was reprogramming an Apple II to operate in Chinese. His list of tasks was long. He had to program an operating system from scratch, since Apple II’s DOS 3.3 simply wouldn’t allow the inputting and outputting of Chinese-character texts. Likewise, he had to program the Chinese word processor itself, a job he worked on tirelessly for months.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1825\" height=\"1721\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridMaster_need2removelensdirt.jpg?w=1825\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025535\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridMaster_need2removelensdirt.jpg 1825w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridMaster_need2removelensdirt.jpg?resize=300,283 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridMaster_need2removelensdirt.jpg?resize=768,724 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridMaster_need2removelensdirt.jpg?resize=1536,1448 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1825px) 100vw, 1825px\" /><figcaption>A photograph of the Sinotype III monitor shows the Gridmaster program and the digitization process of the Chinese character 申 (shen, to extend).</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">LOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While Gridmaster may have been a simple program, the task that it would be used to accomplish—creating digital bitmaps of thousands of Chinese characters—posed profound design challenges. In fact, creating the font for Sinotype III—a machine developed by the Graphics Arts Research Foundation (GARF) in Cambridge, Massachusetts—took far longer than programming the computer itself. Without a font, there would be no way to display Chinese characters on screen, or to output them on the machine’s dot-matrix printer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each Chinese character, designers had to make 256 separate decisions, one for each potential pixel in the bitmap. (A bitmap is a way of storing images digitally—whether as a JPEG, GIF, BMP, or other file format—using a grid of pixels that together make up a symbol or an image.) Multiplied across thousands of characters, this amounted to literally hundreds of thousands of decisions in a development process that took more than two years to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programming Gridmaster—which in hindsight Rosenblum described to me as “clunky to use, at best”—enabled his father, Louis Rosenblum, and GARF to farm out the responsibility of creating the digital font. Using any Apple II machine, and running Gridmaster off a floppy disc, data entry temps could create and save new Chinese character bitmaps, remotely. Once these bitmaps were created and stored, the Rosenblums could install them on the Sinotype III by using a second program (also designed by Bruce) that ingested them and their corresponding input codes into the system’s database. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinotype III was never commercially released. Nevertheless, the painstaking work that went into its development—including the development of this bitmap Chinese font—was central to a complex global effort to solve a vexing engineering puzzle: how to equip a computer to handle Chinese, one of the most widely used languages on Earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4296\" height=\"3269\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RosenblumVIPSlides-33.jpeg?w=2628\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025592\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RosenblumVIPSlides-33.jpeg 4296w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RosenblumVIPSlides-33.jpeg?resize=300,228 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RosenblumVIPSlides-33.jpeg?resize=768,584 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RosenblumVIPSlides-33.jpeg?resize=1536,1169 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RosenblumVIPSlides-33.jpeg?resize=2048,1558 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4296px) 100vw, 4296px\" /><figcaption>A photograph of a Sinotype III monitor displaying the Chinese bitmap font. </figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">LOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the advent of computing and word processing in the West, engineers and designers determined that a low-resolution digital font for English could be built upon a 5-by-7 bitmap grid—requiring only five bytes of memory per symbol. Storing all 128 low-resolution characters in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which includes every letter in the English alphabet, the numerals 0 through 9, and common punctuation symbols, required just 640 bytes of memory—a tiny fraction of, for example, the Apple II’s 64 kilobytes of onboard memory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But there are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, and a 5-by-7 grid was too small to make them legible. Chinese required a grid of 16 by 16 or larger—i.e., at least 32 bytes of memory (256 bits) per character. Were one to imagine a font containing 70,000 low-resolution Chinese characters, the total memory requirement would exceed two megabytes. Even a font containing only 8,000 of the most common Chinese characters would require approximately 256 kilobytes just to store the bitmaps. That was four times the total memory capacity of most off-the-shelf personal computers in the early 1980s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As serious as these memory challenges were, the most taxing problems confronting low-res Chinese font production in the 1970s and 1980s were ones of aesthetics and design. Long before anyone sat down with a program like Gridmaster, the lion’s share of work took place off the computer, using pen, paper, and correction fluid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers spent years trying to fashion bitmaps that fulfilled the low-memory requirements and preserved a modicum of calligraphic elegance. Among those who created this character set, whether by hand-drawing drafts of bitmaps for specific Chinese characters or digitizing them using Gridmaster, were Lily Huan-Ming Ling (凌焕銘) and Ellen Di Giovanni.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5100\" height=\"6600\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?w=1545\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025593\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg 5100w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=232,300 232w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=768,994 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=1545,2000 1545w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=1187,1536 1187w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=1583,2048 1583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5100px) 100vw, 5100px\" /><figcaption>Draft bitmap drawings of Chinese characters for the Sinotype III font.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">LOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The core problem that designers faced was translating between two radically different ways of writing Chinese: the hand-drawn character, produced with pen or brush, and the bitmap glyph, produced with an array of pixels arranged on two axes. Designers had to decide how (and whether) they were going to try to re-create certain orthographic features of handwritten Chinese, such as entrance strokes, stroke tapering, and exit strokes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of the Sinotype III font, the process of designing and digitizing low-resolution Chinese bitmaps was thoroughly documented. One of the most fascinating archival sources from this period is a binder full of grids with hand-drawn hash marks all over them—sketches that would later be digitized into bitmaps for many thousands of Chinese characters. Each of these characters was carefully laid out and, in most cases, edited by Louis Rosenblum and GARF, using correction fluid to erase any “bits” the editor disagreed with. Over top of the initial set of green hash marks, then, a second set of red hash marks indicated the “final” draft. Only then did the work of data entry begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1445\" height=\"1590\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bei_GreenRedCorrectionFluid_SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?w=1445\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025594\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bei_GreenRedCorrectionFluid_SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg 1445w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bei_GreenRedCorrectionFluid_SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=273,300 273w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bei_GreenRedCorrectionFluid_SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=768,845 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bei_GreenRedCorrectionFluid_SinotypeFont02of27-5.jpeg?resize=1396,1536 1396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1445px) 100vw, 1445px\" /><figcaption>A close-up of a draft bitmap drawing of bei (背, back, rear) showing edits made using correction fluid. </figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">LOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the sheer number of bitmaps that the team needed to design—at least 3,000 (and ideally many more) if the machine had any hopes of fulfilling consumers’ needs—one might assume that the designers looked for ways to streamline their work. One way they could have done this, for example, would have been to duplicate Chinese radicals—the base components of a character—when they appeared in roughly the same location, size, and orientation from one character to another. When producing the many dozens of common Chinese characters containing the “woman radical” (女), for example, the team at GARF could have (and, in theory, should have) created just one standard bitmap, and then replicated it within every character in which that radical appeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No such mechanistic decisions were made, however, as the archival materials show.

Bitmap grids with even dimensions (such as the 16-by-16 grid) made symmetry impossible. GARF managed to achieve symmetry by, in many cases, using only a portion of the overall grid: just a 15-by-15 region within the overall 16-by-16 grid. This reduced the amount of usable space even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1499\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridSizes-02.jpeg?w=1200\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025597\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridSizes-02.jpeg 1200w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridSizes-02.jpeg?resize=240,300 240w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GridSizes-02.jpeg?resize=768,959 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><figcaption>Symmetry and asymmetry in the characters shan (山, mounting), zhong (中, middle), ri (日, sun), and tian (田, field). </figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">LOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The story becomes even more complex when we begin to compare the bitmap fonts created by different companies or creators for different projects.

After a string of thock thock keystrokes, the 12-inch Sanyo monitor began to phosphoresce. A green grid appeared, 16 units wide and 16 units tall. This was “Gridmaster,” a program Bruce had cooked up in the programming language BASIC to build one of the world’s first Chinese digital fonts. He was developing the font for an experimental machine called the Sinotype III, which was among the first personal computers to handle Chinese-language input and output.\nAt the time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were no personal computers being built in China. So to make a “Chinese” PC, Rosenblum’s team was reprogramming an Apple II to operate in Chinese. His list of tasks was long. He had to program an operating system from scratch, since Apple II’s DOS 3.3 simply wouldn’t allow the inputting and outputting of Chinese-character texts. Likewise, he had to program the Chinese word processor itself, a job he worked on tirelessly for months.\nA photograph of the Sinotype III monitor shows the Gridmaster program and the digitization process of the Chinese character 申 (shen, to extend).\nLOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS\n\n\n\n\nWhile Gridmaster may have been a simple program, the task that it would be used to accomplish—creating digital bitmaps of thousands of Chinese characters—posed profound design challenges. In fact, creating the font for Sinotype III—a machine developed by the Graphics Arts Research Foundation (GARF) in Cambridge, Massachusetts—took far longer than programming the computer itself. Without a font, there would be no way to display Chinese characters on screen, or to output them on the machine’s dot-matrix printer.\nFor each Chinese character, designers had to make 256 separate decisions, one for each potential pixel in the bitmap. (A bitmap is a way of storing images digitally—whether as a JPEG, GIF, BMP, or other file format—using a grid of pixels that together make up a symbol or an image.) Multiplied across thousands of characters, this amounted to literally hundreds of thousands of decisions in a development process that took more than two years to complete.\nProgramming Gridmaster—which in hindsight Rosenblum described to me as “clunky to use, at best”—enabled his father, Louis Rosenblum, and GARF to farm out the responsibility of creating the digital font. Using any Apple II machine, and running Gridmaster off a floppy disc, data entry temps could create and save new Chinese character bitmaps, remotely. Once these bitmaps were created and stored, the Rosenblums could install them on the Sinotype III by using a second program (also designed by Bruce) that ingested them and their corresponding input codes into the system’s database. \nSinotype III was never commercially released. Nevertheless, the painstaking work that went into its development—including the development of this bitmap Chinese font—was central to a complex global effort to solve a vexing engineering puzzle: how to equip a computer to handle Chinese, one of the most widely used languages on Earth.\nA photograph of a Sinotype III monitor displaying the Chinese bitmap font. \nLOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS\nAt the advent of computing and word processing in the West, engineers and designers determined that a low-resolution digital font for English could be built upon a 5-by-7 bitmap grid—requiring only five bytes of memory per symbol. Storing all 128 low-resolution characters in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which includes every letter in the English alphabet, the numerals 0 through 9, and common punctuation symbols, required just 640 bytes of memory—a tiny fraction of, for example, the Apple II’s 64 kilobytes of onboard memory.\nBut there are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, and a 5-by-7 grid was too small to make them legible. Chinese required a grid of 16 by 16 or larger—i.e., at least 32 bytes of memory (256 bits) per character. Were one to imagine a font containing 70,000 low-resolution Chinese characters, the total memory requirement would exceed two megabytes. Even a font containing only 8,000 of the most common Chinese characters would require approximately 256 kilobytes just to store the bitmaps. That was four times the total memory capacity of most off-the-shelf personal computers in the early 1980s.\nAs serious as these memory challenges were, the most taxing problems confronting low-res Chinese font production in the 1970s and 1980s were ones of aesthetics and design. Long before anyone sat down with a program like Gridmaster, the lion’s share of work took place off the computer, using pen, paper, and correction fluid.\nDesigners spent years trying to fashion bitmaps that fulfilled the low-memory requirements and preserved a modicum of calligraphic elegance. Among those who created this character set, whether by hand-drawing drafts of bitmaps for specific Chinese characters or digitizing them using Gridmaster, were Lily Huan-Ming Ling (凌焕銘) and Ellen Di Giovanni.\nDraft bitmap drawings of Chinese characters for the Sinotype III font.\nLOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe core problem that designers faced was translating between two radically different ways of writing Chinese: the hand-drawn character, produced with pen or brush, and the bitmap glyph, produced with an array of pixels arranged on two axes. Designers had to decide how (and whether) they were going to try to re-create certain orthographic features of handwritten Chinese, such as entrance strokes, stroke tapering, and exit strokes. \nIn the case of the Sinotype III font, the process of designing and digitizing low-resolution Chinese bitmaps was thoroughly documented. One of the most fascinating archival sources from this period is a binder full of grids with hand-drawn hash marks all over them—sketches that would later be digitized into bitmaps for many thousands of Chinese characters. Each of these characters was carefully laid out and, in most cases, edited by Louis Rosenblum and GARF, using correction fluid to erase any “bits” the editor disagreed with. Over top of the initial set of green hash marks, then, a second set of red hash marks indicated the “final” draft. Only then did the work of data entry begin.\nA close-up of a draft bitmap drawing of bei (背, back, rear) showing edits made using correction fluid. \nLOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS\nGiven the sheer number of bitmaps that the team needed to design—at least 3,000 (and ideally many more) if the machine had any hopes of fulfilling consumers’ needs—one might assume that the designers looked for ways to streamline their work. One way they could have done this, for example, would have been to duplicate Chinese radicals—the base components of a character—when they appeared in roughly the same location, size, and orientation from one character to another. When producing the many dozens of common Chinese characters containing the “woman radical” (女), for example, the team at GARF could have (and, in theory, should have) created just one standard bitmap, and then replicated it within every character in which that radical appeared.\nNo such mechanistic decisions were made, however, as the archival materials show. On the contrary, Louis Rosenblum insisted that designers adjust each of these components—often in nearly imperceptible ways—to ensure they were in harmony with the overall character in which they appeared.\nIn the bitmaps for juan (娟, graceful) and mian (娩, to deliver), for example—each of which contains the woman radical—that radical has been changed ever so slightly. In the character juan, the middle section of the woman radical occupies a horizontal span of six pixels, as compared with five pixels in the character mian. At the same time, however, the bottom-right curve of the woman radical extends outward just one pixel further in the character mian, and in the character juan that stroke does not extend at all.\nThe bitmap characters for juan (娟, graceful) and mian (娩, to deliver) from the Sinotype III font, recreated by the author. \nLOUIS ROSENBLUM COLLECTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS\nAcross the entire font, this level of precision was the rule rather than the exception.\nWhen we juxtapose the draft bitmap drawings against their final forms, we see that more changes have been made. In the draft version of luo (罗, collect, net), for example, the bottom-left stroke extends downward at a perfect 45° angle before tapering into the digitized version of an outstroke.

It brings product practices into the sales funnel and calls for your involvement in each and every step (as you should be doing regardless). It gives you the visibility you always wanted and requires real cross-team collaboration. But most of all, it is exciting because it gives you an opportunity to see your strategy coming to life in short cycles with immediate feedback loops.</p><p>The general process of product-led growth starts with mapping the customer journey — the entire one, not just when they become product users: how they hear about the product, why should they start exploring it, where would they start as a result, and what they expect to see. As with everything strategic, you need to make sure it makes sense on paper because if it doesn’t, it won’t make sense in the real world. Once you understand the journey and come up with one that makes sense, you start implementing it. You can start by making small changes to your product and marketing (e.g. replace the “schedule a demo” button on your website with a “start now for free” button), that will help you test some hypothesis or get into the right mindset, but at some point, you will probably need to change the product itself so that it is suitable for product-led growth. You need to have something to offer people to actually work with. Once your MVP is launched, you need to start optimizing and improving until you get all the pieces to work.</p><p>Some people think that optimization is a matter of A/B testing as much as possible and finding the right answers this way. But this isn’t the case. <strong>A/B testing can’t give you the answers, it can only validate or dismiss what you already thought was the right answer</strong>. As I said above, product-led growth is strategy in action, not random success.</p><p>So once you have launched your MVP (congratulations!) here are the things to keep an eye on to make sure you are doing it right.</p><h3>Measure the Entire Customer Journey</h3><p>To optimize your customer journey you have to know what’s working and what’s not. One way to do it is <a href=\"https://ganotnoa.com/the-right-questions-to-ask-your-customers/\">to get in front of your customers</a> and ask them for their perspective. What lured them in, what they wanted to achieve, and why they went away (most of them would at first). To do this, you have to know who these people are (by email at least) and understand their behavior in the system — which means data.</p><p>If you don’t know who your users are and can’t reach out, measuring the customer journey is even more important because it becomes your primary method of understanding what’s going on.</p><p>Here are a few things to focus on when you set up your measurement system:</p><p><strong>Make sure your data is clean and represents reality</strong>. Since funnel data becomes your primary view of the world, make sure it is accurate, or at least understand where it isn’t. For example, if your website includes traffic to older blog posts that are not relevant to what you are offering today (it can be the case after a pivot for example), you shouldn’t count it as part of your traffic because it will skew the numbers. If some of the activity in the system is coming from internal users (you and the team), you shouldn’t count it as activity, because you want real numbers. This is crucial to everything you do next because you will be working for those numbers — so make sure they are representing what you need them to represent.</p><p><strong>Measure the entire journey, not just the product</strong>. I’m sure you have product KPIs, but in product-led growth the product spans into marketing as well. You should understand and measure the entire journey, from the moment they heard about you and got into your website, all the way down to payments and renewals (although this is probably not something you need to worry about on day one. More on that later).</p><p><strong>Measure everything you can, set goals on a few</strong>. Some people are afraid of measuring everything because they are familiar with the single, north-star metric idea, or know that they must focus and are afraid that too many metrics can confuse them and the team. When it comes to setting goals they are right, but measuring doesn’t imply setting goals as well. The numbers are your sensors to the world, and you want to have as many as possible.</p><h3>Solve One Bottleneck at a Time</h3><p>Product-led growth is an optimization journey. As such, knowing what you are optimizing for is very important. It is tempting to think that you want each and every part of the funnel — from acquisition to activation, retention, and all the way to revenue — to work flawlessly. <strong>But that would be a mistake</strong>.</p><p>What you are really looking for is to optimize the entire funnel performance, and <a href=\"https://ganotnoa.com/your-problem-isnt-the-leaky-bucket-its-the-clogged-pipe/\">the funnel is as weak as its weakest link</a>. Your optimization strategy should be as follows: find the bottleneck that is currently your weakest link. Improve it until this is no longer the bottleneck, and your blockage happens somewhere else. Move to solve that one, and repeat this process for as long as needed.</p><p>Note that at the beginning, your funnel will be blocked before it’s completed. That is, your customers would start and abandon before they become actual customers. Your bottleneck then is actually a full blockage, since people won’t go beyond a certain point. Once you remove the barrier they had there, they will continue, until the next barrier. <strong>It will take time to get the entire funnel to work for the first time</strong>, and it should be easy for you to understand where the problem is.</p><h3>Bottom-up, High Touch</h3><p>Product-led growth brings a bottom-up, no/low touch sales approach to the enterprise software world. There are two distinct new paradigms here: selling bottom-up and selling with no/low touch. Theoretically, they are both equally important, but in reality, one is much riskier than the other. <strong>Moving your product sales to work bottom-up is much harder than moving your sales funnel to no/low touch</strong>. Luckily, bottom-up is also the one that is easier to test and validate, so there is no question that you need to start there. Focus on proving that your product can be sold bottom-up. Don’t worry about scale, or about how much human interaction you need to throw in to succeed.</p><p>Since we are in the business of optimizing the entire funnel performance, and now we have established that it doesn’t need to be low/no touch at first, <strong>you can drive some parts of your funnel manually</strong>. This gives you the flexibility to put developers (who are usually the most scarce and expensive resource) only where the product must be changed to achieve the goal.</p><p>Here are two real examples from customers of mine who recently shifted to product-led growth: the first company just released their MVP, and started tracking the funnel. When I talked to the CPO about what needs to be done to get the first paying customer, his immediate response was that you have to have the ability to accept credit cards, which the MVP didn’t include. While this is an important step in the funnel, for the first few customers you don’t need to worry about that, since they will anyway usually convert only after talking to you. So have them signed up and send them an invoice by the end of each month, to pay just like any other enterprise contract. If you do it right, there will come a time when it will be clear that this is now your bottleneck and it’s time to move on to true self-service. But this is not the case at first, so <strong>don’t spend developers’ time on it, since it won’t make the impact that you want</strong>.</p><p>The second company is already working for a while with a free offering, so they have great traction with the “bottom-level” users. They love the product and keep coming back. The CPO there wanted to add to the system an ability to involve the “higher-level” users (e.g. their managers, who are also the decision-makers) so that they can start using the system as well and see value in it. Again, while an important step in and of itself, it turned out that <strong>this is not where their bottleneck was</strong>. Somehow — probably through conversations that happen outside of the system — their “bottom-level” users involved their managers, who in turn engaged in a conversation with the company. Very high-touch, but it works for now. Their most important goal needed to be getting the first paying customers, and involving the “higher-level” users <strong>wasn’t their problem, so solving it wasn’t going to deliver them the results they wanted</strong>.</p><h3>Set Realistic Goals</h3><p>As a last note, setting goals for product-led funnels is very hard to do on day one. From my experience, <strong>most of the goals you would be setting are far too high and unrealistic</strong>. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be setting goals at all though.</p><p>The interesting goal to set at first is time to first paying customer. <strong>It usually takes much longer than you think, not only because things are not working as expected</strong>, but also because the expected has its own pace. When I did this exercise with one of the CPOs from the examples above, we realized that even if things worked perfectly, a lead would take 3 months to convert to a paying customer. They explore the system for a couple of weeks and experiment with it until they decide to use it. Then they start using it only for a part of the organization, which means they don’t have to pay yet since the numbers are too small. It would take about another month or so until they start reaching the usage that requires them to pay, at which point they have to decide that they want to and get the internal approvals before they can continue. All in all, 3 months if everything worked perfectly.</p><p>Product-led growth is all about the customer journey. Make sure you understand it fully, with data and with qualitative inputs combined. Don’t forget that it has its own pace, and optimize one step at a time until you succeed.

But this isn’t the case. A/B testing can’t give you the answers, it can only validate or dismiss what you already thought was the right answer. As I said above, product-led growth is strategy in action, not random success.\nSo once you have launched your MVP (congratulations!) here are the things to keep an eye on to make sure you are doing it right.\nMeasure the Entire Customer Journey\nTo optimize your customer journey you have to know what’s working and what’s not. One way to do it is to get in front of your customers and ask them for their perspective. What lured them in, what they wanted to achieve, and why they went away (most of them would at first). To do this, you have to know who these people are (by email at least) and understand their behavior in the system — which means data.\nIf you don’t know who your users are and can’t reach out, measuring the customer journey is even more important because it becomes your primary method of understanding what’s going on.\nHere are a few things to focus on when you set up your measurement system:\nMake sure your data is clean and represents reality. Since funnel data becomes your primary view of the world, make sure it is accurate, or at least understand where it isn’t. For example, if your website includes traffic to older blog posts that are not relevant to what you are offering today (it can be the case after a pivot for example), you shouldn’t count it as part of your traffic because it will skew the numbers. If some of the activity in the system is coming from internal users (you and the team), you shouldn’t count it as activity, because you want real numbers. This is crucial to everything you do next because you will be working for those numbers — so make sure they are representing what you need them to represent.\nMeasure the entire journey, not just the product. I’m sure you have product KPIs, but in product-led growth the product spans into marketing as well. You should understand and measure the entire journey, from the moment they heard about you and got into your website, all the way down to payments and renewals (although this is probably not something you need to worry about on day one. More on that later).\nMeasure everything you can, set goals on a few. Some people are afraid of measuring everything because they are familiar with the single, north-star metric idea, or know that they must focus and are afraid that too many metrics can confuse them and the team. When it comes to setting goals they are right, but measuring doesn’t imply setting goals as well. The numbers are your sensors to the world, and you want to have as many as possible.\nSolve One Bottleneck at a Time\nProduct-led growth is an optimization journey. As such, knowing what you are optimizing for is very important. It is tempting to think that you want each and every part of the funnel — from acquisition to activation, retention, and all the way to revenue — to work flawlessly. But that would be a mistake.\nWhat you are really looking for is to optimize the entire funnel performance, and the funnel is as weak as its weakest link. Your optimization strategy should be as follows: find the bottleneck that is currently your weakest link. Improve it until this is no longer the bottleneck, and your blockage happens somewhere else. Move to solve that one, and repeat this process for as long as needed.\nNote that at the beginning, your funnel will be blocked before it’s completed. That is, your customers would start and abandon before they become actual customers. Your bottleneck then is actually a full blockage, since people won’t go beyond a certain point. Once you remove the barrier they had there, they will continue, until the next barrier. It will take time to get the entire funnel to work for the first time, and it should be easy for you to understand where the problem is.\nBottom-up, High Touch\nProduct-led growth brings a bottom-up, no/low touch sales approach to the enterprise software world. There are two distinct new paradigms here: selling bottom-up and selling with no/low touch. Theoretically, they are both equally important, but in reality, one is much riskier than the other. Moving your product sales to work bottom-up is much harder than moving your sales funnel to no/low touch. Luckily, bottom-up is also the one that is easier to test and validate, so there is no question that you need to start there. Focus on proving that your product can be sold bottom-up. Don’t worry about scale, or about how much human interaction you need to throw in to succeed.\nSince we are in the business of optimizing the entire funnel performance, and now we have established that it doesn’t need to be low/no touch at first, you can drive some parts of your funnel manually. This gives you the flexibility to put developers (who are usually the most scarce and expensive resource) only where the product must be changed to achieve the goal.\nHere are two real examples from customers of mine who recently shifted to product-led growth: the first company just released their MVP, and started tracking the funnel. When I talked to the CPO about what needs to be done to get the first paying customer, his immediate response was that you have to have the ability to accept credit cards, which the MVP didn’t include. While this is an important step in the funnel, for the first few customers you don’t need to worry about that, since they will anyway usually convert only after talking to you. So have them signed up and send them an invoice by the end of each month, to pay just like any other enterprise contract. If you do it right, there will come a time when it will be clear that this is now your bottleneck and it’s time to move on to true self-service. But this is not the case at first, so don’t spend developers’ time on it, since it won’t make the impact that you want.\nThe second company is already working for a while with a free offering, so they have great traction with the “bottom-level” users. They love the product and keep coming back. The CPO there wanted to add to the system an ability to involve the “higher-level” users (e.g. their managers, who are also the decision-makers) so that they can start using the system as well and see value in it. Again, while an important step in and of itself, it turned out that this is not where their bottleneck was. Somehow — probably through conversations that happen outside of the system — their “bottom-level” users involved their managers, who in turn engaged in a conversation with the company. Very high-touch, but it works for now. Their most important goal needed to be getting the first paying customers, and involving the “higher-level” users wasn’t their problem, so solving it wasn’t going to deliver them the results they wanted.\nSet Realistic Goals\nAs a last note, setting goals for product-led funnels is very hard to do on day one. From my experience, most of the goals you would be setting are far too high and unrealistic. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be setting goals at all though.\nThe interesting goal to set at first is time to first paying customer. It usually takes much longer than you think, not only because things are not working as expected, but also because the expected has its own pace. When I did this exercise with one of the CPOs from the examples above, we realized that even if things worked perfectly, a lead would take 3 months to convert to a paying customer. They explore the system for a couple of weeks and experiment with it until they decide to use it. Then they start using it only for a part of the organization, which means they don’t have to pay yet since the numbers are too small. It would take about another month or so until they start reaching the usage that requires them to pay, at which point they have to decide that they want to and get the internal approvals before they can continue. All in all, 3 months if everything worked perfectly.\nProduct-led growth is all about the customer journey. Make sure you understand it fully, with data and with qualitative inputs combined. Don’t forget that it has its own pace, and optimize one step at a time until you succeed.

There are no rules that apply to each scenario, just good practices that have worked in other organizations before. Hence, you have to figure out on your own what is working for your organization. Finding this answer is a process and not a destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of the Product Owner itself is making the hiring process difficult to handle. The Product Owner is the least well-defined accountability within the Scrum framework and—at the same time—the one Scrum role with the most facets. (Please note that I will continue using ‘role’ on occasions throughout this document, although the Scrum Guide 2020 now speaks of ‘accountabilities.’)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>A Product Owner is an innovator at heart and thus a value creator for customers and organizations if given a chance to work in an agile manner. The Product Owner is also the most vulnerable Scrum role. Turn them into a [fill-in a ticket-system of your choice] monkey or deprive them of the ability to say ‘no’—as in being the guardian of the Product Backlog—, and the Product Owner quickly becomes the Achilles heel of any agile organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Product Owner role depends on the size of an organization, the industry it is operating in, its culture, and the lifecycle stage of that organization’s product(s). Lastly, there is an overlap with the product manager role. (Spoiler alert: they aren’t identical.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following interview questions are neither suited nor intended to turn an inexperienced interviewer into an agile software development expert. But in a seasoned practitioner’s hands, they support figuring out who of the candidates has been successfully working the agile trenches in the past. Remember, “Agile” is a mindset, not a methodology. Hence, no checklist can drive your recruiting success to the desired outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Product Owner interview questions in this PDF are modeled after a holistic model of agile product development for software products:</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Holistic-3.jpg\" alt=\"Product Owner Interview Questions — A holistic Perspective on Agile Product Development\" width=\"1270\" height=\"906\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64509\" data-wp-pid=\"64509\" nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Holistic-3.jpg 1270w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Holistic-3-825x589.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Holistic-3-1200x856.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>In this model, product discovery is moved as far as possible to the left to keep costs of validating hypotheses—derived from a vision and strategy—low and increase the speed of experimentation. In this approach, the Product Owner needs to coach the Scrum Team on how to adopt such a holistic model, teaming up with the Scrum Master in the process. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the PDF contains additional background and contextual information, how the following set of questions can be interpreted as well as guidance on desired or acceptable ranges of answers for each question. The questions themselves are grouped into six categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-training-classes-liberating-structures-workshop-events/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Upcoming-Scrum-Liberating-Stuctures-Training-classes-workshops-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Upcoming Scrum and Liberating Stuctures training classes and workshops — Berlin Product People GmbH\" width=\"1270\" height=\"277\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64941\" data-wp-pid=\"64941\" nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Upcoming-Scrum-Liberating-Stuctures-Training-classes-workshops-banner.jpg 1270w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Upcoming-Scrum-Liberating-Stuctures-Training-classes-workshops-banner-825x180.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Upcoming-Scrum-Liberating-Stuctures-Training-classes-workshops-banner-800x174.jpg 800w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Upcoming-Scrum-Liberating-Stuctures-Training-classes-workshops-banner-1200x262.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Product Owner Interview Questions: The Organization of Questions and Answers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ebook provides both questions as well as guidance on the range of suitable answers.

Please keep the following in mind when asking the questions: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><em>What is the purpose of being agile in the first place?</em><p>As the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” states, it is mainly about adaptability over following a plan. Or, to put it with Peter Drucker, it is about doing the right things, and less about doing the things right. Concerning product development, being agile is about postponing deciding to invest in the latest economically feasible moment. This is achieved by testing hypotheses as fast and as inexpensive as possible, thus mitigating risk and maximizing the development team’s work. It also means to have the courage to stop an effort in case the chosen course is no longer viable.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How would you characterize your role as Product Owner? Are you a facilitator, a coach, a manager, a visionary, a tactician, a coordinator, or a “driver?”</em><p>This is an open-ended question better to understand the candidates’ perception of their role. A Product Owner is a leadership role, yielding no authority in a traditional management sense. In that way, the Product Owner is featured a bit by all the labels mentioned in the question. The Product Owner role has also been dubbed as “bottleneck” or the “Achilles heel of the Scrum process”; any mentioning of that would undoubtedly be a plus. If a candidate is mostly referring to something like “I am the one creating the user stories,” I would dig into that.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How would you characterize our role as Product Owner, particularly concerning the product manager role? Or are both roles just different labels for &#8220;product people&#8221; and are basically identical?  </em><p>Full-stack “product people”—covering the product manager &#038; Product Owner role in one person—are rare. Often, it takes too much time to cover all responsibilities: from communication to stakeholders and customers to organize the operational work within the Scrum process. Depending on the product, Product Owners hence can quickly spread themselves too thin to become a meaningful player in the process. (Speaking of which: a Product Owner is not a requirements engineer, not a business analyst, and not a user stories expert either.) As a result, you may observe that large organizations split the responsibilities among two or more individuals. Here, the product manager is often responsible for strategic aspects, while the Product Owner is a more tactical role. For smaller or less complex products, Product Owners may very well cover both roles simultaneously.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>To what extent is the Product Owner a “product manager”?</em><p>There is a fine line between a product manager and a Product Owner role, and it depends on how the role is crystallized in the company&#8217;s structure and culture. Usually, besides product management duties, Product Ownership entails establishing the product vision and strategy, its alignment with the company&#8217;s goals and objectives, and managing any internal and external stakeholders in this process. </p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>When was the last time you told a stakeholder “No”? How did you approach this situation, and what was the reason for it?</em><p>Saying “no” is an essential qualification—and empowerment—for each Product Owner. For example, it is required to protect the team from a stakeholder’s pet project of a doubtful value. Or to put an end to silo thinking and local optimization within the organization. Product owners create value by shipping the right product and maximizing the amount of work deliberately not done. Because of that, the organization has to respect a “no” from them. Otherwise, they will not fulfill their role: maximizing the product&#8217;s value across the whole organization. Applying “Scrum” without an empowered Product Owner creates a great “Waterfall 2.0” process. The Product Owner’s empowerment to decide over the Product Backlog can therefore act as a litmus test of the organization’s adoption of agile principles.</p>  </li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Your Product Backlog is gated by a “product committee.” It is meeting regularly and applies a kind of Stage Gate® process to approve new features. Can you act as a credible Product Owner if you&#8217;re not in control of the Product Backlog?</em><p>Suppose a person or a group of individuals, for example, a product council, exercises control over the Product Backlog. In that case, you&#8217;re not a Product Owner but a proxy. You&#8217;re probably more a product manager that happens to work with an agile team that uses a subset of Scrum. That may work fine, depending on the organization&#8217;s nature, culture, and product. But it cannot be called Scrum.</p>  </li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What “labels” come to your mind when you think of your role as Product Owner?</em><p>CEO of the product, product visionary, strategic thinker, servant leader w/o authority, entrepreneur/intrapreneur, innovator, systems thinker, single wringable neck.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you collaborate with the other Scrum Team members?</em><p>Early, often, respectfully, transparently, being available regularly, and responding with adequate speed and attention. As the <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-team\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020: The Scrum Team\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum Guide 2020</a> states: “The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.”</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Would you feel bothered if your Scrum Master suggested a possible course of action concerning product development?</em><p>Self-organization is at the core of any serious agile framework, Scrum included. Suppose a candidate feels uncomfortable with the concept that the Scrum Team or the Scrum Master have ideas on how product discovery and delivery might improve in the future. In that case, you should dig deeper into that. It’s not a good idea to substitute silos at the department level with “functional silos” within Scrum, when communication, sharing ideas and creating a shared understanding are paramount for Scrum Team’s success.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>If you are the &#8220;client&#8221; and the Scrum Master is the representative of the delivery entity, how do you best collaborate?</em><p>The best way of collaboration for PO and Scrum Master is embracing Scrum Values. Both serve in leadership roles without yielding any authority. Both depend on each other for the Scrum Team’s success, for example, accomplishing a Sprint Goal. They are both also allies concerning coaching the organization to become agile. Daily, the Product Owner is responsible for promptly providing feedback on product matters, clarifying goals, and ensuring that everyone on the Scrum Team understands the product vision. The Scrum Master, in return, needs to support the Product Owner in building an actionable Product Backlog while facilitating an effective collaboration within the Scrum Team in general.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What roles would you deem necessary for a cross-functional Scrum Team delivering software?</em><p>Generally speaking, in an ideal world, the members of a cross-functional team cover all skills that are required by the Scrum Team to deliver value to customers independently. This may work for a product at an early stage when one team is handling everything. When the organization needs to scale, dealing with interdependencies—here: other teams—becomes a necessity. Depending on that, the actual composition of a team highly depends on what the team is delivering. Typical roles in cross-functional teams are business or data analysts, UX and UI designers, Developers (front-end, back-end), QA Developers, and probably DevOps engineers.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>In what Scrum events shall the Product Owner be participating?</em><p>The Product Owner is expected to participate in all events: Daily Scrums, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospectives. Otherwise, the Product Owner cannot answer possible questions quickly, and impediments cannot be solved in a timely fashion, which would contradict the core of being agile.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Is it necessary to have a product vision to be successful as a Product Owner?</em><p>Absolutely. Or, to cite <a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/lewis_carroll_165865\" title=\"Lewis Carroll quotes — 71 Product Owner Interview Questions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Carroll</a>: “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.” The agile product stack starts with the vision and strategy of the company. It then is broken down into a product portfolio—where applicable—and the product roadmap for each service and product, and ends with the corresponding Product Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs. The Product Owner needs to be familiar with all levels of the agile product stack.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>In what way is the Product Owner a bottleneck for the Scrum Team?</em><p>This question deals with how Product Owners can mitigate the risk they pose to the Scrum Team. Often, they slow down the team because the Product Backlog management process is insufficient. There might be several reasons for that: Product Backlog items are created shortly before a Sprint is supposed to start. Or work items do not meet quality standards, as they cannot allocate enough time for their creation and refinement. Beyond the Product Backlog management, they might not be available on short notice to answer questions during a Sprint. A useful way of Product Owner risk mitigation involves the other Scrum Team members at an earlier stage. Or they are encouraging collective ownership of the product by the Scrum Team. This approach is much supported by creating a shared understanding of goals at the team level. (Start with the “Why are we doing this?”)</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you know that you are a good Product Owner?</em><p>Adding user stories to the Product Backlog merely proves that the PO can handle the ticket system. Measuring real value to customers, however, requires a different approach. Suitable KPIs of the Product Owner’s contribution to the team would focus on the outcome, not output. Examples of such metrics are the lead-time from idea to an available feature, cycle time for valuating ideas, or NPS scores. (Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/resources/evidence-based-management\" title=\"Evidence-Based Management by Scrum.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Evidence-Based Management for Product Owners</a>.)</p></li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Set 2: Product Discovery and External Stakeholders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This category of the Product Owner interview questions is branching out into the areas of product discovery and product management:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><em>Do you think that Scrum is adequately handling the product discovery process?</em><p>Lean UX, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, or Service Design are other agile practices that are much better suited for product discovery than Scrum. All that Scrum refers to is that the Product Owner is accountable for managing the Product Backlog. Supposedly, the Product Owner is the individual who knows what is valuable at any given time. But Scrum doesn’t elaborate on how the Product Owner gains this insight.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you learn about new ideas and requirements?  </em><p>Here, Product Owner candidates should explain their ideas of a product discovery process: From idea, via hypothesis, and experiment and validation. There are various ways to come up with ideas: Through analyzing market needs, industry trends, your data (analytics, NPS, etc.), and the competition. Also, regular sessions with stakeholders, such as sales and customer care, and the Scrum Team(s) tend to be fruitful. Empowering team members to spend a part of their work-time on new ideas is also a powerful practice. (Think of Gmail.) Most importantly, observing customers regularly by running continuous user tests is an effective way of gaining insights for new features, products, and services. This approach is even more useful when the whole Scrum Team actively participates in the process.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What practices and frameworks can you hire to learn about your customers’ needs?</em><p>The candidate should name a few of the leading agile frameworks, such as Jobs-to-be-done, Lean UX, Lean Startup, Design Sprints, Service Design, design ethnography, and lean user testing, NPS, Voice of the Customer, and others.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you include user research in the product discovery process?</em><p>User research, or better: user testing, should be a continuous, regular exercise in any product-driven organization. It’s a vital part of the agile build-measure-learn cycle. Practically, this means that communicating with UX designers and researchers becomes an integral part of the work of the PO and the entire Scrum Team. (Ideally, they belong to the team itself.) Also, customer feedback is continuously gathered by running frequent user interviews and observations. Moreover, these ideas also apply to technical projects, for example, API services.</p>  </li>\r\n\t<li><em>How much time do you allocate to user research and understanding your customers’ needs?</em><p>Spending 50 % of their time with customers would be great. However, if it’s less than 10 %, and if no one else is handling product discovery on behalf of the Product Owner, the product discovery process needs to be improved. For example, by relieving the PO from administrative tasks, such as user story writing. (Note: the Product Owner is not primarily a user story author.)</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How would you design a process to handle product ideas from stakeholders and other members of the organization?</em><p>Actively involving stakeholders and members of the general organization in the product discovery process is a sound approach. People like to have a purpose in life and be a part of something larger than themselves. So, providing a possibility to contribute to everyone without regard for their position in the organization will make working as a PO easier. A process for this level of inclusion doesn’t require fancy technology. A simple, shared spreadsheet or form is enough to kick-start it. An initial template to suggest new product features could comprise questions that address the why, the what, and the for whom. It could handle the tactical or strategic nature of the suggestion, a possible time-frame, or an estimate of the expected return on investment. Most importantly, designing the process should be kept agile: start with a simple solution, then improve it once the first experience has been made.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>At what stage do you involve the Scrum Team in the product discovery process?</em><p>It is highly recommended to involve the Scrum Team as early as possible in the product discovery process. There are mainly three reasons for that practice: (1) The sooner the Developers participate in the product discovery process, the lesser the chances are that solutions are pursued that are technically not viable or would not result in a return on investment. (2) An early involvement ensures that the Product Owner and the other Scrum Team members develop a shared understanding and ownership of what they will build. This helps significantly allocate resources to the right issues, maximize the customer&#8217;s value, and mitigate the investment risk. (3) Developers&#8217; early involvement also ensures their buy-in, a higher commitment level, and the Scrum Team&#8217;s willingness to participate in all product development phases. This will provide additional motivation on the Scrum Team&#8217;s side to participate in any change needed to accomplish the goals defined for each Sprint/product release.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you determine whether an idea is a worthwhile investment?</em><p>There are quantitative and qualitative categories, such as revenue increases, cost-cutting benefits by internal process improvements, increased customer satisfaction rates (NPS), sign-ups from customers for new products, positive customer feedback in customer care, etc. With this open question, Product Owner candidates should demonstrate their knowledge of determining what content constitutes an actionable Product Backlog, maximizing the value of the Developers&#8217; work on behalf of the customers. It opens the area of product metrics broad. It allows for a discussion of outcomes vs. outputs, the escape from the feature factory, and how to overcome the industrial paradigm in general.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you avoid misallocating resources on features or products that no one wants?</em><p>Product Owners can avoid misallocating resources by a firm decision at the moment when it is clear that a product or feature is not valuable or not feasible. This means that a continuous monitoring process, such as metrics or regular user tests, needs to be established. Once the build-measure-learn cycle provides proof that an idea or a product is unlikely to succeed, the resource allocation needs to stop. (Don’t allow the “sunk cost” fallacy to cloud your judgment: no matter how much has been already spent, it does not justify to continue working on the product.)</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>During which stages are Product Owners participating in planning activities?</em><p>There are several stages in which a Product Owner should participate, starting at the portfolio level to the product stage, to the release planning, and the Sprint Planning. Participation during the vision and strategy stages is highly recommended, though.</p></li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Set 3: Internal Stakeholder Management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This category of the Product Owner interview questions deals with specific aspects of relationships of the Product Owners with internal stakeholders: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Your organization has recently decided to become agile and product-driven. How do you educate your stakeholders about the implications?</em><p>A good starting point would be working with the “Manifesto of Agile Software Development,” particularly ensuring that stakeholders understand that adapting to change over following a plan is paramount for the organization’s future success. Stakeholders also need to understand that “requirements” (and thus probably local optimizations efforts) are no longer a valid form of the product delivery process. Instead, continuous product discovery and iterative and incremental product creation become the guiding principles, elevating experiments, and accepting failure to good practices. Becoming agile means competing with other—probably more valuable—product ideas for scarce resources and accepting that the PO is the gatekeeper to the Product Backlog. It means that there are no more arbitrary delivery dates, but delivery intervals, projecting the knowledge of today into the future. Lastly, stakeholders will need to understand the magnitude of abandoning the command &#038; control management style and empowering autonomous and self-organizing teams for product delivery.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you organize the collaboration with stakeholders and improve it over time?</em><p>Communication and transparency are critical to effective collaboration with stakeholders. There are various ways to establish and improve this communication over time. For example, institute regular meetings with each stakeholder or have stakeholders name product ambassadors, who then act as “liaison officers” and train them accordingly. Arrange workshops with stakeholders and ambassadors, and ask your Scrum Master and the Developers to join the effort. Team up with the user experience people and run, for example, user journey or user story mapping workshops. Or invite stakeholders to Product Backlog refinement sessions to explain a user story&#8217;s value to the rest of the Scrum Team. Sprint Reviews and user interviews are also well suited to improve collaboration and communication over time.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you communicate with uncooperative stakeholders?</em><p>An often promising way to deal with uncooperative stakeholders is to win them over by demonstrating the value of agile product development. Early in the transition process, it is advisable to educate them with product-related workshops on agile principles. Proven examples are user story mapping or product roadmap planning workshops. (It is recommended to secure the help of an experienced coach at this stage.) It has also proven to help establish a close communication schedule with the stakeholders, for example, by having regular meetings. Also, educating members from stakeholder teams to act as “liaison officers” to the product organization significantly improves cooperation. It mitigates the usual feeling of losing control on the stakeholders’ side. At a later stage, typical agile events, such as Sprint Reviews, also work well by demonstrating what value the Scrum Team created for them. Generally, it is a process that will take time, and there are no shortcuts available. As a last resort, if everything else hasn’t worked out, the PO might need support from a C-level sponsor.

Nevertheless, your most important stakeholder insists on “finishing it” because so much effort has already been invested. How do you deal with that?</em><p>Agile first principles require to adapt to change over executing a plan in the first place. If a project is late, it probably has lost some of its original value to the organization and its customers. In this case, reevaluating its benefit before pouring more resources into it is a necessity. If the project still delivers value, you should probably go for it. Keep in mind that there is always competition from the other investment opportunities comprising the Product Backlog. However, continue building it merely because of the prior investment means that the stakeholder has fallen for the <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/\" title=\"Sunk Cost Fallacy\r\n —  BehavioralEconomics.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sunk cost fallacy.</a></p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you deal with pet projects?</em><p>Submit the pet project to the usual, standardized process that every product idea has to master. Just continuously update the business case behind such a pet project and have it compete with valuable projects. Sooner or later, common sense will end this kind of misallocation of resources, as pet projects rarely provide a return on investment. Other stakeholders with valuable projects make good allies in this conflict.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>In the middle of a quarter, the sales department suggests features of doubtful value. Your Scrum Team believes that these features are merely wild guesses to secure the sales bonus. Consequently, they are reluctant to talk about them. How do you handle the situation with the salespeople? </em><p>This problem is generally comparable to the pet project problem and could be dealt with accordingly. However, the distinguishing factor, in this case, is the urgency and probably the party’s different status that’s demanding the features. In a sales-driven organization, the sales team can often secure sponsorship from the C-level for such suggestions. This tends to happen when sales forecasts are missed. In this situation, the Product Owner can often only rally support from other stakeholders to fight off the demand based on opportunity costs. If the usual process is overridden by executive intervention, the Product Owner needs to address this issue immediately. You can’t have the (agile) cake and eat it, too.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>The sales department often sells new features to close deals without talking to you first. How do you deal with that?</em><p>Usually, this kind of attitude is encouraged by the management in pursuit of meeting sales targets. It reflects a non-agile, opportunistic mindset that values instant gratification—more sales—over a sustainable product development strategy. To change this mindset, it certainly helps to reach out to the sales department and offer them support on the sales process&#8217;s technical side as early as possible. However, given the sales team&#8217;s usual incentives, a real change will only happen if the management buys-in to agile product development principles. These might include an adaptation of the remuneration scheme for sales.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you deal with suggestions for new features and products from stakeholders and other members of the organization?</em><p>Providing an idea management system is a good starting point. This can be a simple template for the suggesting party covering the what, why, when, for whom, and ROI questions. Start communicating with the person in question throughout the evaluation. If a suggestion is accepted for realization, include the suggesting person in the following process. (For example, invite the individual to a user story mapping workshop or user tests.) Lastly, provide continuous feedback throughout the whole development and delivery cycle with regular checkpoints against the original targets. Finally, 3-12 months after shipping, update the stakeholder whether the expectations—for example, ROI, cost savings, engagement, and other KPI—have been met out in the field.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Scrum Product Owner Interview Questions Set 4: Product Portfolio and Roadmap Planning</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The questions in this set concern one of the most contentious topics in the profession: “How do we build agile product roadmaps that work?”</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Product vision and strategy are kept confidential in your organization to prevent competitors from stealing the ideas. Will that impede your work as a Product Owner?</em><p>Yes, it would significantly impede the Product Owner&#8217;s work, as transparency is required to innovate most effectively within an organization. Nowadays, innovation is a team sport. The brilliant individual—creating great innovations single-handedly—is a myth. (Not even Mr. Jobs considered himself to be such an individual.) Such a joined team effort always starts with a shared understanding of product vision and strategy.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Aren’t portfolio and product roadmap planning anachronisms in an agile organization?</em><p>No, that practice is not anachronistic at all. A product portfolio encompasses strategic objectives and goals at the company level. These endeavors are related not only to the overarching goal. They are also associated with their sustainability from a financial point of view. One initiative, for example, can act as a source of investment for another one. Or all these endeavors have a common investment source. A portfolio plan helps structure investment sources, thus contributing to better financial management while illustrating business value sources.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What is your approach to creating product roadmaps?</em><p>In general, you would consider a top-down approach, starting with the company goals and the general product vision. Once several iterations with the leadership and stakeholders have been performed, it is usually advisable to combine the first draft with a bottom-up initiative. Meeting somewhere in the middle guarantees those crucial aspects, while probably of a more detailed nature, aren’t lost in the process.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How often shall product roadmaps be planned—once a year?</em><p>Product roadmap planning is a continuous exercise to analyze products at all stages: live, in development, under planning, or on the brink of being phased-out. Depending on the organization&#8217;s maturity, the size of the product portfolio, its products and service, the industry, and its level of regulation, this can be a quarterly or even monthly practice.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you connect teams to the product vision and show them how their contributions impact bringing that vision to life?</em><p>The recommended way to achieve this goal is to include the Scrum Team in the product discovery process actively. Suppose Developers are merely confronted with requirement documents. In that case, they rightfully feel disrespected, as they only have limited options to become self-organized as they are told what to do. (Which leads to a cog-in-the-machinery syndrome, tempering with their idea of autonomy.) There are various ways how the Product Owner can include the Developers in the product discovery process, for example, by user story mappings with other stakeholders, inclusion in the portfolio and product roadmap planning, participation in user tests, to name a few.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Who shall participate in the product roadmap planning?</em><p>Usually, it&#8217;s the internal stakeholders, Scrum Team members or their representatives, and the Product Owners. Adding customers to the mix is a bonus.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How much of your time do you spend talking with customers and researching industry trends?</em><p>As a rule of thumb, 50% are supposed to be allocated to stakeholder communication of all kinds. </p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What has Monte Carlo to do with projected delivery dates?</em><p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method\" title=\"Monte Carlo method — Wikipedia.org\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monte Carlo simulation is an algorithm-based statistical approach</a> to obtain numerical results. Product Owners can use this approach to forecast probable delivery windows of releases or features based on the previous Scrum Team performance. (This question opens the discussion on how to deal with deadlines, forecasts, and other legitimate inquiries of stakeholders regarding product delivery.)</p></li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Set 5: Product Backlog, Refinement, Work Items, Forecasts, and Estimations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This category of the Product Owner interview questions covers the Product Owner’s home turf: the Product Backlog, its refinement, and work item creation:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><em>What is the purpose behind the Product Backlog refinement?</em><p>The refinement is a continuous process to create actionable Product Backlogs that allow a Scrum Team to have a Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scrum Team accomplishes this level of preparedness by regularly refining Product Backlog items in small groups or with the whole Scrum Team, and not just once every Sprint as part of the Sprint Planning. The idea behind the refinement is to create a shared understanding with all team members, why a particular work item is valuable, what the Developers shall create, and how to realize the work item technically.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How much time should you spend on Product Backlog refinement?</em><p>While the Scrum Guide 2020 drop the previous guidance on the time allocation, it remains a practical rule of thumb that the Scrum Team should reserve up to 10% of its time for the Product Backlog refinement.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How would you organize the &#8220;refining&#8221; process of Product Backlog items?</em><p>In general, it is beneficial to structure the refinement process around questions such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What items are no longer relevant? </li>\r\n\t<li>What items need to be split? </li>\r\n\t<li>What items can be updated with new information? </li>\r\n\t<li>Does this update change previous estimations? </li>\r\n\t<li>Has the priority of specific items changed? </li>\t\r\n\t<li>Do we have any new topics or learnings that haven’t yet been considered? (If yes, these need to be captured as new Product Backlog items.)</li></ul></p>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How many Product Backlog items can you work on in parallel to ensure continued relevance to customers and the company?</em><p>It depends on several issues, such as the balance between stakeholder communication, customer research, and the Product Owner’s commitment to their Scrum Team. Working on more Product Backlog items than the team can handle in two to three Sprints at the same time might prove to be difficult, though. Often, if Product Owners cannot allocate sufficient time to a single item, they waste resources on half-baked work items of a questionable value.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>You love using the Product Backlog as a kind of repository, adding ideas to continue working on them at a later stage. Over time, you have created over 500 tickets in various stages. What is your take: Can a Scrum Teamwork effectively on 500 tickets? </em><p>From my experience, any Product Backlog that is larger than the scope of three or four Sprints is barely manageable if you want to maintain an actionable Product Backlog. Misusing a Product Backlog by adding hundreds of items to it is a clear sign that the Product Owner needs help from the Developers and the Scrum Master to better cope with the influx of ideas, suggestions, and requirements to avoid misallocating resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, beware of appeasing nagging stakeholders by merely adding their “requirements” to the Product Backlog. This does not solve the issues; it just postpones the inevitable discussion as the stakeholders will now expect that the Scrum Team will create their Increment.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>At what level do you include other team members in the refinement process?</em><p>When the foundation of a Product Backlog item is ready for that. The readiness isn’t easy to generalize since it depends on the nature of the product itself, the Scrum Team’s experience, and the organization’s leadership style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my experience, this influences the readiness and availability of a Scrum Team to contribute to the refinement process effectively. For creating a shared understanding of the why, what, and how of a work item among all team members, the precise moment of involvement is crucial. If the team is involved too early, the Developers may consider this a waste of their time. If the Scrum Team is involved too late—for example, all specifications have already been prepared—, they may feel not respected. If in doubt, the Product Owner should include the Scrum Master in the process.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you identify the value of a Product Backlog item?</em><p>Some proven categories to define value are projected revenue increase, cost cutting effects, a projected growth of the customer base, and an increase in customer satisfaction rates. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>More metrics are available from <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/resources/evidence-based-management\" title=\"Evidence-Based Management — Scrum.org\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum.org’s Evidence-Based Management model</a>.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you communicate to your team members the value of a backlog item?</em><p>Product Owners communicate value with any information suitable to further the Scrum Team’s understanding. That communication can be quantitative, such as analytical data describing how a process is utilized, financial projections, an increase in conversion rates, acquiring new customers, etc.) It can also be qualitative, such as transcripts, screencasts, or videos from a user testing session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preferably, the Scrum Team members already know in advance as they are regularly participating in user research activities.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What are good practices to order Product Backlog items?</em><p>Criteria to determine the order of a Product Backlog item, for example, are value, risk, work estimates, available expertise, and dependencies.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you handle bugs and technical debt when many valuable new features are competing for resources?</em><p>Focusing solely on shipping new features is a slippery slope that quickly leads to the build-up of technical debt. You trade a short-term win—shipping more features—for a long-term liability. Technical debt will inevitably slow down the creature of new Product Increments in the future, probably to a point where the product seems to be at a standstill. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words: By accruing technical debt, the very purpose of becoming agile—learning faster as an organization than the competition, thus being able to exploit market opportunities—is at stake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence it is a good practice to allocate around 20 percent of the Scrum Team’s capacity to keeping technical debt at bay at any given time. Experienced Product Owners support this long-term thinking.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Why is user story mapping a useful technique for Product Owners?</em><p>User story mapping a great way to visualize the &#8220;big picture&#8221; within a Product Backlog. Additionally, user story mapping is an instrumental means to improve communication with stakeholders and the Scrum Team. These workshops create a shared product understanding across teams, roles, and departments.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How do you best create Product Backlog items?</em><p>The best way to create Product Backlog items, particularly user stories, is a collaborative and iterative approach, using collective inspection and adaptation, including the whole Scrum Team. User story creation should not blindly follow a specific template but rather be a lively negotiation with the team, focusing on reaching a shared understanding of “why,” “what,” and “how” with all team members.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What shall a good user story look like? What is it structure?</em><p>For software development, the attributes of an exemplary user story are: \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The description is available,</li>\r\n\t<li>Acceptance criteria are defined, </li>\r\n\t<li>The story can be delivered within a Sprint, </li>\r\n\t<li>All UI deliverables are available, </li>\r\n\t<li>All (probable) dependencies are identified, </li>\r\n\t<li>Performance criteria are defined, </li>\r\n\t<li>Tracking criteria are defined and </li>\r\n\t<li>The story is estimated by the team. (I do believe that you cannot “not estimate” one way or another. Even the #noestimate approach includes a sizing model that is based on a kind of unspoken estimation.) </li>\r\n</ol></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Product Owners should be familiar with <a href=\"https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/3cs-revisited/\" title=\"Three-C's Revisited\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ron Jeffries Three-Cs—Card</a>, Conversation, Confirmation—and <a href=\"https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/\" title=\"INVEST in Good Stories, and SMART Tasks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Wake’s INVEST principle</a>. \r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Where are you discussing user stories, only during refinement sessions?</em><p>The best way to discuss a user story is by doing so synchronously with all involved team members to ensure that a shared understanding is created. This approach works for co-located as well as distributed Scrum Teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asynchronous discussions may be an option when team members cannot participate in a discussion or when the Product Owner is in the field, and feedback is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would help if you avoided, though, lengthy discussions via comments on tickets. That’s a sign of a weak refinement process as it creates unnecessary queues of idleness. </p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>What are typical pitfalls of the Product Backlog refinement?</em><p>Some of the typical pitfalls of a backlog refinement are: \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>There are not enough refinement sessions, resulting in a low quality of the Product Backlog. \r\n\t<li>There are too many refinement sessions, resulting in an overly detailed Product Backlog, resembling an upfront planning from the old waterfall planning ages. \r\n\t<li>Turning requirement documents from stakeholders into user stories without involving the Scrum Team. \r\n\t<li>Not involving the whole team in the refinement process, probably just the “lead engineer”. \r\n\t<li>Not involving stakeholders. \r\n</ol></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This open question is an invitation to Product Owner candidates to share from their previous experience and how it influenced their current understanding of proper Product Backlog management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an extensive list of anti-patterns available in the following article: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/28-product-backlog-anti-patterns/\" title=\"28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns</a>.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Is it necessary to include detailed acceptance criteria with a user-story?</em><p>Generally, acceptance criteria define the functional and non-functional requirements that need to be met. The level of detail may vary depending on the nature of the task. Hence, it is a good practice to include the Scrum Team in their creation as some of those requirements may already be addressed by the team’s Definition of Done.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>The Scrum Team requires time to investigate a technical issue with a user story to understand its requirements better. How do you continue with the refinement process of the particular user story?</em><p>Borrow from XP and run a spike during the next Sprint. Once the team can provide better insights to its technical side, come back to the user story, and resume the refinement.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>One of your stakeholders presents you with such elaborate requirement documents that you copy them into Product Backlog items. Nevertheless, your Scrum Team is not pleased with this approach. Why is that?</em><p>Product Backlog items are a token for discussion to create a shared understanding and secure the Developers&#8217; buy-in. If the Developers are not involved in devising, disseminating, and capturing these, they do not see any ownership in such work items. This likely results in a lower level of engagement, which may negatively affect the value created for customers.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>When would you remove a feature?</em><p>The best way to “remove” useless features is not to build them in the first place. Simplicity and radical focus on value delivered to customers is key to any successful agile product organization. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should—despite all validation efforts during product discovery—a feature of lesser value slip into the Product Backlog and be delivered, it should be removed as soon as possible from the live product. The same applies to an existing feature that has outlived its usefulness.\r\n</p></li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scrum Product Owner Interview Questions Set 6: Sprint Planning, Sprint, Sprint Review, and Retrospective</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The sixth category that addresses the Sprint itself:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><em>You are pushing for a critical user story to be selected for the next Sprint. Unfortunately, the final front-end designs still are missing, but the designers promise to deliver no more than two days late into the Sprint. The Scrum Master, however, rejects this idea; the work item is not ready to be selected for a Sprint. What can you do?</em><p>It is a negotiation with the Scrum Team. The answer depends on the team’s situation and experience: If the designers are likely delivering—they have always kept their promises in the past—, and the Developers could accomplish the user story nevertheless within the Sprint, and the Developers agree with the situation, it is probably an acceptable exception.</p><p>Ultimately, the Scrum Team’s decision is whether to pick the work item for the next Sprint.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Do you recommend that a Product Owner shall assign work items to individual members of the Scrum Team?</em><p>That is unacceptable behavior, as the Developers are self-organizing. Hence distributing tasks among themselves is their prerogative.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Should the Product Owner attend the whole Sprint Planning?</em>\r\n<p>Let’s have a closer look at the Sprint Planning:</p><p>The Product Owner presents the business objective of the next Sprint to the Scrum Team. Collaboratively, the Scrum Team creates the Sprint Goal. The Developers then pick— considering all circumstances, for example, available capacity—those Product Backlog items they deem necessary to achieve the Sprint Goal. The presence of the Product Owner during this part of the Sprint Planning is essential.</p><p>Often, the Developers now add details to the Sprint Backlog items, for example, splitting them up into tasks, identifying parts that need further clarification, or agreeing on who will be working on what tasks. Product Owners do not necessarily need to participate in this part of the Sprint Planning. But they need to be on stand-by for additional questions.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Should the Product Owner attend the Daily Scrums?</em><p>By all means, yes. That way, the Product Owner can answer quickly, thus avoiding unnecessary delays.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Your Scrum Team, at least that is your impression, regularly estimates work items at the upper end of the possible range. You believe that they are playing safe, creating buffers for &#8220;rainy days.&#8221; How do you address this?</em><p>Trust is the beginning of all. And the Developers do not trust the process, or the line management, or the stakeholders. This mistrust might be rooted in the organization&#8217;s culture, a former experience, or the work item&#8217;s quality. The team might also be too junior to understand some work items&#8217; implications fully. Or the product is suffering from technical debt, which makes estimates generally more volatile.</p><p>The candidate should name some reasons for the behavior and suggest joining with the Scrum Master to provide the team with a path to let this habit go. The issue would make an outstanding topic for the Sprint Retrospective.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>A stakeholder tends to broaden the scope of a user story in retrospect by claiming the Scrum Team did not deliver what was requested. How do you deal with that?</em><p>This kind of stakeholder behavior is not acceptable. It is the Product Owner’s objective to understand the scope of a feature request in advance clearly. Sneaking in features through the backdoor a typical Scrum anti-pattern that needs to be investigated and addressed.</p><p>This question opens the discussion on how to deal with selfish stakeholders, particularly in organizations that haven’t yet fully embraced the Product Owner concept.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Does the Product Owner have a veto when the release of Product Increments is concerned?</em><p>The Scrum Guide is not explicit about this situation. On the one side, the Scrum Team decides on when to release what Increment to the customers. On the other side, the Product Owner is “<a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\" title=\"Scrum Guide 2020\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team</a>.”</p><p>This question opens the discussion on Scrum’s built-in checks and balances and how effective collaboration within the Scrum Team might work.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>Do you have to release every Product Increment that was finished during a Sprint?</em><p>\r\nThe Scrum Team decides on when to release what Increment to the customers. There is no automatism for the release.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>How would you organize the Sprint Review?</em><p>It is not the Product Owner’s task to organize the Sprint Review, but the whole Scrum Team should be eager to experience it. The Sprint Review is a critical opportunity to inspect the previous Sprint’s outcome and adapt the Product Backlog to serve the customers with the next Sprint best.</p></li>\r\n\r\n\t<li><em>During the Sprint Review, the Developers show new functionality you have never seen before. How do you react?</em><p>This behavior is undoubtedly an anti-pattern of a successful Scrum Team as it violates several Scrum principles, for example, providing transparency or adhering to openness and respect.</p><p>First of all, Developers should never work on items the Product Owner does not know. Bypassing the Product Owner in that respect shows a significant deficit in understanding Scrum basics and should immediately be addressed in collaboration with the Scrum Master.

Hence they participate in the Sprint Retrospective.</p></li>\r\n\r\n  </ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Update 2020-06-20: The Product Owner Interview Enhanced by Remote Scrum with Distributed Teams</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>How can we learn during the Product Owner interview whether a candidate has experience with facilitating remote agile events?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To figure out the candidate’s competence level, I like to run a Liberating Structures-based exercise during the interview. I use <a href=\"http://www.liberatingstructures.com/6-making-space-with-triz/\" title=\"TRIZ — Stop Counterproductive Activities and Behaviors to Make Space for Innovation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TRIZ</a> to task the Product Owner candidate to come up with suggestions on how to sabotage a remote Scrum approach effectively when talking to teammates, internal stakeholders or customers. (Who is considering running user tests in person at the moment?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the remote agile anti-patterns the candidate should be able to identify:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Remote Agile is just standard work-life plus Zoom</strong>: Pretending that working remotely is the same as usual except for the video cameras. (This approach ignores all the challenges that distributed teams face, for example, not investing enough in getting to know each other better to build trust. We are Social animals and need to meet In person sooner or later to build lasting trust among teammates, thus creating psychological safety. Moreover, there are difficulties in reading the virtual room in general, which means that taking decisions to the team or calling out introverts manifest themselves differently in a remote working setup. Trust is the beginning of all; without it, transparency, inspection, and adaptation would be able to work their magic, and we end up as distributed feature factories.) </li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Neither fish nor meat</strong>: Hybrid events create two classes of teammates — remote and co-located — where the co-located folks are calling the shots. (Beware of the distance bias—when out of sight means out of mind—thus avoiding the creation of a privileged subclass of teammates: “Distance biases have become all too common in today’s globalized world. They emerge in meetings when folks in the room fail to gather input from their remote colleagues, who may be dialing in on a conference line.” (<a href=\"https://neuroleadership.com/your-brain-at-work/seeds-model-biases-affect-decision-making/\" title=\"The 5 Biggest Biases That Affect Decision-Making\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a>.) To avoid this scenario, make sure that once a single participant joins remotely, all other participants “dial in,” too, to level the playing field.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Surveillance</strong>: Trust won’t be built by surveilling and micro-managing team members. Therefore, don’t go rogue; the prime directive rules more than ever in a remote agile setup. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdnmm/working-from-home-zoom-tells-your-boss-if-youre-not-paying-attention\" title=\"Working From Home? Zoom Tells Your Boss If You're Not Paying Attention\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trust in people and do not spy on them</a> — no matter how tempting it might be. (Read more about the damaging effect of a downward spiraling trust dynamic from Esther Derby.) https://www.estherderby.com/the-future-may-be-remote-must-it-include-surveillance/</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong> Mindless rituals</strong>: Leadership belief and or facilitation practices turn once useful routines into mindless rituals. (For example, think of Groundhog Day-style retrospectives over and over again. Answering the same three questions every single time is the easiest path to kill any form of creativity and collaboration. While this is hard to avoid in face-to-face environments, it requires much more dedication and energy in a remote agile setting.)</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Death by PowerPoint</strong>: Meetings still revolve around an individual broadcasting a slide deck. (While you might get away with this approach for some time in face-2-face environments, it will not fly with distributed teams. Sessions need to inclusive, interactive, and engaging to entice collaboration, think Liberating Structures, and Training from the Back of the Room.)</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Unstructured communication</strong>: “Didn’t you get the memo?” (There is no clear practice on how to communicate which kind of information to whom. Are we talking about email, Slack, the team wiki, a Github comment, or the biweekly remote brow bag session? This lack of structure and agreement leads to stress—how can I avoid missing important news now that there is no longer a watercooler; do I have to monitor all Slack channels in real-time—and probably a feeling of being excluded. Maybe, this effect is just a missing update to the working agreement or team charter. But what if it is done deliberately?

While the basic rules are trivial, getting a group of individuals with different backgrounds, levels of engagement, and personal agendas, to continuously deliver value by creating a great product is challenging. The larger the organization is, the more management level there are, the more likely failure in one of its many forms is lurking around the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Product Owner interview questions are not necessarily suited to turn an inexperienced interviewer into an agile expert. However, they support figuring out what candidate has been working in the agile trenches and who’s more likely to be an imposter. (You should avoid inviting candidates from the latter category to a trial.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence it’s probably a good idea to look for a pragmatic veteran who has experienced failure—and success—in other projects before and the scars to prove it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding certifications of candidates, I recommend looking out for those with <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-certification\" title=\"Professional Scrum Product Owner I Certicate — 71 Product Owner Interview Questions — Age-of-Product.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PSPO I</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-product-owner-ii-assessment\" title=\"Professional Scrum Product Owner II Certicate — 71 Product Owner Interview Questions — Age-of-Product.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PSPO II</a>, and particularly <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-product-owner-iii-assessment\" title=\"Professional Scrum Product Owner III Certicate — 71 Product Owner Interview Questions — Age-of-Product.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PSPO III certificates</a> from Scrum.org.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>📖 Related Posts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/38-scrum-master-interview-questions-to-avoid-imposters-free-pdf/\" title=\"Age_of-Product.com: Free Ebook: 47 Scrum Master Interview Questions to Identify Suitable Candidates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47 Scrum Master Interview Questions to Identify Suitable Candidates</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-anti-patterns/\" title=\"Age of Product: Product Owner Anti-Patterns — 31 Ways to Improve as a PO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Product Owner Anti-Patterns — 31 Ways to Improve as a PO</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/peer-recruiting/\" title=\"Peer Recruiting: How to Hire a Scrum Master in Agile Times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peer Recruiting: How to Hire a Scrum Master in Agile Times</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-guide-reordered/\" title=\"The Scrum Guide Reordered — understand the Scrum Guide quickly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> The Scrum Guide Reordered — understand the Scrum Guide’ patterns and concepts quickly to avoid hiring imposters</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>✋ Do Not Miss Out: Join the 9,000-plus Strong ‘Hands-on Agile’ Slack Team</h2>\r\n<p>I invite you to join the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/LObbRtSF9vvxN3CL2\" title=\"Membership Application for the Hands-on Agile Slack Community\" target=\"_blank\" trigger-id=\"112090\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Hands-on Agile” Slack team</a> and enjoy the benefits of a fast-growing, vibrant community of agile practitioners from around the world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/handsonagile-LOGO.jpg\" alt=\"Join the Hands-on Agile Slack Group\" width=\"1270\" height=\"220\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64308\" data-wp-pid=\"64308\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/handsonagile-LOGO.jpg 1270w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/handsonagile-LOGO-1200x208.jpg 1200w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/handsonagile-LOGO-825x143.jpg 825w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/handsonagile-LOGO-800x139.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>If you like to join now all you have to do now is <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/LObbRtSF9vvxN3CL2\" title=\"Membership Application for the Hands-on Agile Slack Community\" target=\"_blank\" trigger-id=\"112090\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provide your credentials via this Google form</a>, and I will sign you up.

There are no rules that apply to each scenario, just good practices that have worked in other organizations before. Hence, you have to figure out on your own what is working for your organization. Finding this answer is a process and not a destination.\n\r\n\r\nThe role of the Product Owner itself is making the hiring process difficult to handle. The Product Owner is the least well-defined accountability within the Scrum framework and—at the same time—the one Scrum role with the most facets. (Please note that I will continue using ‘role’ on occasions throughout this document, although the Scrum Guide 2020 now speaks of ‘accountabilities.’)\n \r\n\r\nA Product Owner is an innovator at heart and thus a value creator for customers and organizations if given a chance to work in an agile manner. The Product Owner is also the most vulnerable Scrum role. Turn them into a [fill-in a ticket-system of your choice] monkey or deprive them of the ability to say ‘no’—as in being the guardian of the Product Backlog—, and the Product Owner quickly becomes the Achilles heel of any agile organization.\n\r\n\r\nThe Product Owner role depends on the size of an organization, the industry it is operating in, its culture, and the lifecycle stage of that organization’s product(s). Lastly, there is an overlap with the product manager role. (Spoiler alert: they aren’t identical.)\n\r\n\r\nThe following interview questions are neither suited nor intended to turn an inexperienced interviewer into an agile software development expert. But in a seasoned practitioner’s hands, they support figuring out who of the candidates has been successfully working the agile trenches in the past. Remember, “Agile” is a mindset, not a methodology. Hence, no checklist can drive your recruiting success to the desired outcome.\n\r\n\r\nThe Product Owner interview questions in this PDF are modeled after a holistic model of agile product development for software products:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this model, product discovery is moved as far as possible to the left to keep costs of validating hypotheses—derived from a vision and strategy—low and increase the speed of experimentation. In this approach, the Product Owner needs to coach the Scrum Team on how to adopt such a holistic model, teaming up with the Scrum Master in the process. \n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the PDF contains additional background and contextual information, how the following set of questions can be interpreted as well as guidance on desired or acceptable ranges of answers for each question. The questions themselves are grouped into six categories.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owner Interview Questions: The Organization of Questions and Answers\n\r\n\r\nThe ebook provides both questions as well as guidance on the range of suitable answers. These should allow an interviewer to deep dive into candidates’ understanding of Scrum and their agile mindset. However, please note that:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThe answers reflect the personal experience of the author and may not be valid for every organization: what works for organization A is probably failing in organization B,\n\r\n\t\nThere are not suitable multiple choice questions to identify a candidate’s agile mindset given the complexity of applying “agile” to any organization,\n\r\n\t\nThe author has a holistic view of agile practices: agile equals product discovery (what to build) plus product delivery (how to build it).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease find the following 71 Product Owner interview questions to identify suitable candidates for the role of Product Owner:\n\r\n\r\nScrum Product Owner Interview Questions Set 1: The Role of a Scrum Product Owner\n\r\n\r\nThis category addresses the meta-level of the Product Owner role and the Scrum process. Please keep the following in mind when asking the questions: \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat is the purpose of being agile in the first place?\nAs the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” states, it is mainly about adaptability over following a plan. Or, to put it with Peter Drucker, it is about doing the right things, and less about doing the things right. Concerning product development, being agile is about postponing deciding to invest in the latest economically feasible moment. This is achieved by testing hypotheses as fast and as inexpensive as possible, thus mitigating risk and maximizing the development team’s work. It also means to have the courage to stop an effort in case the chosen course is no longer viable.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow would you characterize your role as Product Owner? Are you a facilitator, a coach, a manager, a visionary, a tactician, a coordinator, or a “driver?”\nThis is an open-ended question better to understand the candidates’ perception of their role. A Product Owner is a leadership role, yielding no authority in a traditional management sense. In that way, the Product Owner is featured a bit by all the labels mentioned in the question. The Product Owner role has also been dubbed as “bottleneck” or the “Achilles heel of the Scrum process”; any mentioning of that would undoubtedly be a plus. If a candidate is mostly referring to something like “I am the one creating the user stories,” I would dig into that.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow would you characterize our role as Product Owner, particularly concerning the product manager role? Or are both roles just different labels for “product people” and are basically identical?  \nFull-stack “product people”—covering the product manager & Product Owner role in one person—are rare. Often, it takes too much time to cover all responsibilities: from communication to stakeholders and customers to organize the operational work within the Scrum process. Depending on the product, Product Owners hence can quickly spread themselves too thin to become a meaningful player in the process. (Speaking of which: a Product Owner is not a requirements engineer, not a business analyst, and not a user stories expert either.) As a result, you may observe that large organizations split the responsibilities among two or more individuals. Here, the product manager is often responsible for strategic aspects, while the Product Owner is a more tactical role. For smaller or less complex products, Product Owners may very well cover both roles simultaneously.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nTo what extent is the Product Owner a “product manager”?\nThere is a fine line between a product manager and a Product Owner role, and it depends on how the role is crystallized in the company’s structure and culture. Usually, besides product management duties, Product Ownership entails establishing the product vision and strategy, its alignment with the company’s goals and objectives, and managing any internal and external stakeholders in this process. \n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhen was the last time you told a stakeholder “No”? How did you approach this situation, and what was the reason for it?\nSaying “no” is an essential qualification—and empowerment—for each Product Owner. For example, it is required to protect the team from a stakeholder’s pet project of a doubtful value. Or to put an end to silo thinking and local optimization within the organization. Product owners create value by shipping the right product and maximizing the amount of work deliberately not done. Because of that, the organization has to respect a “no” from them. Otherwise, they will not fulfill their role: maximizing the product’s value across the whole organization. Applying “Scrum” without an empowered Product Owner creates a great “Waterfall 2.0” process. The Product Owner’s empowerment to decide over the Product Backlog can therefore act as a litmus test of the organization’s adoption of agile principles.\n  \n\r\n\r\n\t\nYour Product Backlog is gated by a “product committee.” It is meeting regularly and applies a kind of Stage Gate® process to approve new features. Can you act as a credible Product Owner if you’re not in control of the Product Backlog?\nSuppose a person or a group of individuals, for example, a product council, exercises control over the Product Backlog. In that case, you’re not a Product Owner but a proxy. You’re probably more a product manager that happens to work with an agile team that uses a subset of Scrum. That may work fine, depending on the organization’s nature, culture, and product. But it cannot be called Scrum.\n  \n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat “labels” come to your mind when you think of your role as Product Owner?\nCEO of the product, product visionary, strategic thinker, servant leader w/o authority, entrepreneur/intrapreneur, innovator, systems thinker, single wringable neck.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you collaborate with the other Scrum Team members?\nEarly, often, respectfully, transparently, being available regularly, and responding with adequate speed and attention. As the Scrum Guide 2020 states: “The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.”\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWould you feel bothered if your Scrum Master suggested a possible course of action concerning product development?\nSelf-organization is at the core of any serious agile framework, Scrum included. Suppose a candidate feels uncomfortable with the concept that the Scrum Team or the Scrum Master have ideas on how product discovery and delivery might improve in the future. In that case, you should dig deeper into that. It’s not a good idea to substitute silos at the department level with “functional silos” within Scrum, when communication, sharing ideas and creating a shared understanding are paramount for Scrum Team’s success.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nIf you are the “client” and the Scrum Master is the representative of the delivery entity, how do you best collaborate?\nThe best way of collaboration for PO and Scrum Master is embracing Scrum Values. Both serve in leadership roles without yielding any authority. Both depend on each other for the Scrum Team’s success, for example, accomplishing a Sprint Goal. They are both also allies concerning coaching the organization to become agile. Daily, the Product Owner is responsible for promptly providing feedback on product matters, clarifying goals, and ensuring that everyone on the Scrum Team understands the product vision. The Scrum Master, in return, needs to support the Product Owner in building an actionable Product Backlog while facilitating an effective collaboration within the Scrum Team in general.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat roles would you deem necessary for a cross-functional Scrum Team delivering software?\nGenerally speaking, in an ideal world, the members of a cross-functional team cover all skills that are required by the Scrum Team to deliver value to customers independently. This may work for a product at an early stage when one team is handling everything. When the organization needs to scale, dealing with interdependencies—here: other teams—becomes a necessity. Depending on that, the actual composition of a team highly depends on what the team is delivering. Typical roles in cross-functional teams are business or data analysts, UX and UI designers, Developers (front-end, back-end), QA Developers, and probably DevOps engineers.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nIn what Scrum events shall the Product Owner be participating?\nThe Product Owner is expected to participate in all events: Daily Scrums, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospectives. Otherwise, the Product Owner cannot answer possible questions quickly, and impediments cannot be solved in a timely fashion, which would contradict the core of being agile.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nIs it necessary to have a product vision to be successful as a Product Owner?\nAbsolutely. Or, to cite Lewis Carroll: “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.” The agile product stack starts with the vision and strategy of the company. It then is broken down into a product portfolio—where applicable—and the product roadmap for each service and product, and ends with the corresponding Product Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs. The Product Owner needs to be familiar with all levels of the agile product stack.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nIn what way is the Product Owner a bottleneck for the Scrum Team?\nThis question deals with how Product Owners can mitigate the risk they pose to the Scrum Team. Often, they slow down the team because the Product Backlog management process is insufficient. There might be several reasons for that: Product Backlog items are created shortly before a Sprint is supposed to start. Or work items do not meet quality standards, as they cannot allocate enough time for their creation and refinement. Beyond the Product Backlog management, they might not be available on short notice to answer questions during a Sprint. A useful way of Product Owner risk mitigation involves the other Scrum Team members at an earlier stage. Or they are encouraging collective ownership of the product by the Scrum Team. This approach is much supported by creating a shared understanding of goals at the team level. (Start with the “Why are we doing this?”)\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you know that you are a good Product Owner?\nAdding user stories to the Product Backlog merely proves that the PO can handle the ticket system. Measuring real value to customers, however, requires a different approach. Suitable KPIs of the Product Owner’s contribution to the team would focus on the outcome, not output. Examples of such metrics are the lead-time from idea to an available feature, cycle time for valuating ideas, or NPS scores. (Learn more about Evidence-Based Management for Product Owners.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet 2: Product Discovery and External Stakeholders\n\r\n\r\nThis category of the Product Owner interview questions is branching out into the areas of product discovery and product management:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nDo you think that Scrum is adequately handling the product discovery process?\nLean UX, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, or Service Design are other agile practices that are much better suited for product discovery than Scrum. All that Scrum refers to is that the Product Owner is accountable for managing the Product Backlog. Supposedly, the Product Owner is the individual who knows what is valuable at any given time. But Scrum doesn’t elaborate on how the Product Owner gains this insight.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you learn about new ideas and requirements?  \nHere, Product Owner candidates should explain their ideas of a product discovery process: From idea, via hypothesis, and experiment and validation. There are various ways to come up with ideas: Through analyzing market needs, industry trends, your data (analytics, NPS, etc.), and the competition. Also, regular sessions with stakeholders, such as sales and customer care, and the Scrum Team(s) tend to be fruitful. Empowering team members to spend a part of their work-time on new ideas is also a powerful practice. (Think of Gmail.) Most importantly, observing customers regularly by running continuous user tests is an effective way of gaining insights for new features, products, and services. This approach is even more useful when the whole Scrum Team actively participates in the process.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat practices and frameworks can you hire to learn about your customers’ needs?\nThe candidate should name a few of the leading agile frameworks, such as Jobs-to-be-done, Lean UX, Lean Startup, Design Sprints, Service Design, design ethnography, and lean user testing, NPS, Voice of the Customer, and others.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you include user research in the product discovery process?\nUser research, or better: user testing, should be a continuous, regular exercise in any product-driven organization. It’s a vital part of the agile build-measure-learn cycle. Practically, this means that communicating with UX designers and researchers becomes an integral part of the work of the PO and the entire Scrum Team. (Ideally, they belong to the team itself.) Also, customer feedback is continuously gathered by running frequent user interviews and observations. Moreover, these ideas also apply to technical projects, for example, API services.\n  \n\r\n\t\nHow much time do you allocate to user research and understanding your customers’ needs?\nSpending 50 % of their time with customers would be great. However, if it’s less than 10 %, and if no one else is handling product discovery on behalf of the Product Owner, the product discovery process needs to be improved. For example, by relieving the PO from administrative tasks, such as user story writing. (Note: the Product Owner is not primarily a user story author.)\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow would you design a process to handle product ideas from stakeholders and other members of the organization?\nActively involving stakeholders and members of the general organization in the product discovery process is a sound approach. People like to have a purpose in life and be a part of something larger than themselves. So, providing a possibility to contribute to everyone without regard for their position in the organization will make working as a PO easier. A process for this level of inclusion doesn’t require fancy technology. A simple, shared spreadsheet or form is enough to kick-start it. An initial template to suggest new product features could comprise questions that address the why, the what, and the for whom. It could handle the tactical or strategic nature of the suggestion, a possible time-frame, or an estimate of the expected return on investment. Most importantly, designing the process should be kept agile: start with a simple solution, then improve it once the first experience has been made.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nAt what stage do you involve the Scrum Team in the product discovery process?\nIt is highly recommended to involve the Scrum Team as early as possible in the product discovery process. There are mainly three reasons for that practice: (1) The sooner the Developers participate in the product discovery process, the lesser the chances are that solutions are pursued that are technically not viable or would not result in a return on investment. (2) An early involvement ensures that the Product Owner and the other Scrum Team members develop a shared understanding and ownership of what they will build. This helps significantly allocate resources to the right issues, maximize the customer’s value, and mitigate the investment risk. (3) Developers’ early involvement also ensures their buy-in, a higher commitment level, and the Scrum Team’s willingness to participate in all product development phases. This will provide additional motivation on the Scrum Team’s side to participate in any change needed to accomplish the goals defined for each Sprint/product release.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you determine whether an idea is a worthwhile investment?\nThere are quantitative and qualitative categories, such as revenue increases, cost-cutting benefits by internal process improvements, increased customer satisfaction rates (NPS), sign-ups from customers for new products, positive customer feedback in customer care, etc. With this open question, Product Owner candidates should demonstrate their knowledge of determining what content constitutes an actionable Product Backlog, maximizing the value of the Developers’ work on behalf of the customers. It opens the area of product metrics broad. It allows for a discussion of outcomes vs. outputs, the escape from the feature factory, and how to overcome the industrial paradigm in general.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you avoid misallocating resources on features or products that no one wants?\nProduct Owners can avoid misallocating resources by a firm decision at the moment when it is clear that a product or feature is not valuable or not feasible. This means that a continuous monitoring process, such as metrics or regular user tests, needs to be established. Once the build-measure-learn cycle provides proof that an idea or a product is unlikely to succeed, the resource allocation needs to stop. (Don’t allow the “sunk cost” fallacy to cloud your judgment: no matter how much has been already spent, it does not justify to continue working on the product.)\n\r\n\r\n\t\nDuring which stages are Product Owners participating in planning activities?\nThere are several stages in which a Product Owner should participate, starting at the portfolio level to the product stage, to the release planning, and the Sprint Planning. Participation during the vision and strategy stages is highly recommended, though.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet 3: Internal Stakeholder Management\n\r\n\r\nThis category of the Product Owner interview questions deals with specific aspects of relationships of the Product Owners with internal stakeholders: \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYour organization has recently decided to become agile and product-driven. How do you educate your stakeholders about the implications?\nA good starting point would be working with the “Manifesto of Agile Software Development,” particularly ensuring that stakeholders understand that adapting to change over following a plan is paramount for the organization’s future success. Stakeholders also need to understand that “requirements” (and thus probably local optimizations efforts) are no longer a valid form of the product delivery process. Instead, continuous product discovery and iterative and incremental product creation become the guiding principles, elevating experiments, and accepting failure to good practices. Becoming agile means competing with other—probably more valuable—product ideas for scarce resources and accepting that the PO is the gatekeeper to the Product Backlog. It means that there are no more arbitrary delivery dates, but delivery intervals, projecting the knowledge of today into the future. Lastly, stakeholders will need to understand the magnitude of abandoning the command & control management style and empowering autonomous and self-organizing teams for product delivery.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you organize the collaboration with stakeholders and improve it over time?\nCommunication and transparency are critical to effective collaboration with stakeholders. There are various ways to establish and improve this communication over time. For example, institute regular meetings with each stakeholder or have stakeholders name product ambassadors, who then act as “liaison officers” and train them accordingly. Arrange workshops with stakeholders and ambassadors, and ask your Scrum Master and the Developers to join the effort. Team up with the user experience people and run, for example, user journey or user story mapping workshops. Or invite stakeholders to Product Backlog refinement sessions to explain a user story’s value to the rest of the Scrum Team. Sprint Reviews and user interviews are also well suited to improve collaboration and communication over time.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you communicate with uncooperative stakeholders?\nAn often promising way to deal with uncooperative stakeholders is to win them over by demonstrating the value of agile product development. Early in the transition process, it is advisable to educate them with product-related workshops on agile principles. Proven examples are user story mapping or product roadmap planning workshops. (It is recommended to secure the help of an experienced coach at this stage.) It has also proven to help establish a close communication schedule with the stakeholders, for example, by having regular meetings. Also, educating members from stakeholder teams to act as “liaison officers” to the product organization significantly improves cooperation. It mitigates the usual feeling of losing control on the stakeholders’ side. At a later stage, typical agile events, such as Sprint Reviews, also work well by demonstrating what value the Scrum Team created for them. Generally, it is a process that will take time, and there are no shortcuts available. As a last resort, if everything else hasn’t worked out, the PO might need support from a C-level sponsor. (Read more: 11 Proven Stakeholder Communication Tactics during an Agile Transition.) \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA new feature is overdue and has been drastically underestimated due to unexpected technical debt. Nevertheless, your most important stakeholder insists on “finishing it” because so much effort has already been invested. How do you deal with that?\nAgile first principles require to adapt to change over executing a plan in the first place. If a project is late, it probably has lost some of its original value to the organization and its customers. In this case, reevaluating its benefit before pouring more resources into it is a necessity. If the project still delivers value, you should probably go for it. Keep in mind that there is always competition from the other investment opportunities comprising the Product Backlog. However, continue building it merely because of the prior investment means that the stakeholder has fallen for the <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/\" title=\"Sunk Cost Fallacy\r\n —  BehavioralEconomics.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sunk cost fallacy.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you deal with pet projects?\nSubmit the pet project to the usual, standardized process that every product idea has to master. Just continuously update the business case behind such a pet project and have it compete with valuable projects. Sooner or later, common sense will end this kind of misallocation of resources, as pet projects rarely provide a return on investment. Other stakeholders with valuable projects make good allies in this conflict.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nIn the middle of a quarter, the sales department suggests features of doubtful value. Your Scrum Team believes that these features are merely wild guesses to secure the sales bonus. Consequently, they are reluctant to talk about them. How do you handle the situation with the salespeople? \nThis problem is generally comparable to the pet project problem and could be dealt with accordingly. However, the distinguishing factor, in this case, is the urgency and probably the party’s different status that’s demanding the features. In a sales-driven organization, the sales team can often secure sponsorship from the C-level for such suggestions. This tends to happen when sales forecasts are missed. In this situation, the Product Owner can often only rally support from other stakeholders to fight off the demand based on opportunity costs. If the usual process is overridden by executive intervention, the Product Owner needs to address this issue immediately. You can’t have the (agile) cake and eat it, too.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThe sales department often sells new features to close deals without talking to you first. How do you deal with that?\nUsually, this kind of attitude is encouraged by the management in pursuit of meeting sales targets. It reflects a non-agile, opportunistic mindset that values instant gratification—more sales—over a sustainable product development strategy. To change this mindset, it certainly helps to reach out to the sales department and offer them support on the sales process’s technical side as early as possible. However, given the sales team’s usual incentives, a real change will only happen if the management buys-in to agile product development principles. These might include an adaptation of the remuneration scheme for sales.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you deal with suggestions for new features and products from stakeholders and other members of the organization?\nProviding an idea management system is a good starting point. This can be a simple template for the suggesting party covering the what, why, when, for whom, and ROI questions. Start communicating with the person in question throughout the evaluation. If a suggestion is accepted for realization, include the suggesting person in the following process. (For example, invite the individual to a user story mapping workshop or user tests.) Lastly, provide continuous feedback throughout the whole development and delivery cycle with regular checkpoints against the original targets. Finally, 3-12 months after shipping, update the stakeholder whether the expectations—for example, ROI, cost savings, engagement, and other KPI—have been met out in the field.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScrum Product Owner Interview Questions Set 4: Product Portfolio and Roadmap Planning\n\r\n\r\nThe questions in this set concern one of the most contentious topics in the profession: “How do we build agile product roadmaps that work?”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nProduct vision and strategy are kept confidential in your organization to prevent competitors from stealing the ideas. Will that impede your work as a Product Owner?\nYes, it would significantly impede the Product Owner’s work, as transparency is required to innovate most effectively within an organization. Nowadays, innovation is a team sport. The brilliant individual—creating great innovations single-handedly—is a myth. (Not even Mr. Jobs considered himself to be such an individual.) Such a joined team effort always starts with a shared understanding of product vision and strategy.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nAren’t portfolio and product roadmap planning anachronisms in an agile organization?\nNo, that practice is not anachronistic at all. A product portfolio encompasses strategic objectives and goals at the company level. These endeavors are related not only to the overarching goal. They are also associated with their sustainability from a financial point of view. One initiative, for example, can act as a source of investment for another one. Or all these endeavors have a common investment source. A portfolio plan helps structure investment sources, thus contributing to better financial management while illustrating business value sources.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat is your approach to creating product roadmaps?\nIn general, you would consider a top-down approach, starting with the company goals and the general product vision. Once several iterations with the leadership and stakeholders have been performed, it is usually advisable to combine the first draft with a bottom-up initiative. Meeting somewhere in the middle guarantees those crucial aspects, while probably of a more detailed nature, aren’t lost in the process.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow often shall product roadmaps be planned—once a year?\nProduct roadmap planning is a continuous exercise to analyze products at all stages: live, in development, under planning, or on the brink of being phased-out. Depending on the organization’s maturity, the size of the product portfolio, its products and service, the industry, and its level of regulation, this can be a quarterly or even monthly practice.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you connect teams to the product vision and show them how their contributions impact bringing that vision to life?\nThe recommended way to achieve this goal is to include the Scrum Team in the product discovery process actively. Suppose Developers are merely confronted with requirement documents. In that case, they rightfully feel disrespected, as they only have limited options to become self-organized as they are told what to do. (Which leads to a cog-in-the-machinery syndrome, tempering with their idea of autonomy.) There are various ways how the Product Owner can include the Developers in the product discovery process, for example, by user story mappings with other stakeholders, inclusion in the portfolio and product roadmap planning, participation in user tests, to name a few.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWho shall participate in the product roadmap planning?\nUsually, it’s the internal stakeholders, Scrum Team members or their representatives, and the Product Owners. Adding customers to the mix is a bonus.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow much of your time do you spend talking with customers and researching industry trends?\nAs a rule of thumb, 50% are supposed to be allocated to stakeholder communication of all kinds. \n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat has Monte Carlo to do with projected delivery dates?\nA Monte Carlo simulation is an algorithm-based statistical approach to obtain numerical results. Product Owners can use this approach to forecast probable delivery windows of releases or features based on the previous Scrum Team performance. (This question opens the discussion on how to deal with deadlines, forecasts, and other legitimate inquiries of stakeholders regarding product delivery.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet 5: Product Backlog, Refinement, Work Items, Forecasts, and Estimations\n\r\n\r\nThis category of the Product Owner interview questions covers the Product Owner’s home turf: the Product Backlog, its refinement, and work item creation:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat is the purpose behind the Product Backlog refinement?\nThe refinement is a continuous process to create actionable Product Backlogs that allow a Scrum Team to have a Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice.\n\r\n\r\nThe Scrum Team accomplishes this level of preparedness by regularly refining Product Backlog items in small groups or with the whole Scrum Team, and not just once every Sprint as part of the Sprint Planning. The idea behind the refinement is to create a shared understanding with all team members, why a particular work item is valuable, what the Developers shall create, and how to realize the work item technically.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow much time should you spend on Product Backlog refinement?\nWhile the Scrum Guide 2020 drop the previous guidance on the time allocation, it remains a practical rule of thumb that the Scrum Team should reserve up to 10% of its time for the Product Backlog refinement.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow would you organize the “refining” process of Product Backlog items?\nIn general, it is beneficial to structure the refinement process around questions such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat items are no longer relevant? \n\r\n\t\nWhat items need to be split? \n\r\n\t\nWhat items can be updated with new information? \n\r\n\t\nDoes this update change previous estimations? \n\r\n\t\nHas the priority of specific items changed? \n\t\r\n\t\nDo we have any new topics or learnings that haven’t yet been considered? (If yes, these need to be captured as new Product Backlog items.)\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow many Product Backlog items can you work on in parallel to ensure continued relevance to customers and the company?\nIt depends on several issues, such as the balance between stakeholder communication, customer research, and the Product Owner’s commitment to their Scrum Team. Working on more Product Backlog items than the team can handle in two to three Sprints at the same time might prove to be difficult, though. Often, if Product Owners cannot allocate sufficient time to a single item, they waste resources on half-baked work items of a questionable value.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou love using the Product Backlog as a kind of repository, adding ideas to continue working on them at a later stage. Over time, you have created over 500 tickets in various stages. What is your take: Can a Scrum Teamwork effectively on 500 tickets? \nFrom my experience, any Product Backlog that is larger than the scope of three or four Sprints is barely manageable if you want to maintain an actionable Product Backlog. Misusing a Product Backlog by adding hundreds of items to it is a clear sign that the Product Owner needs help from the Developers and the Scrum Master to better cope with the influx of ideas, suggestions, and requirements to avoid misallocating resources.\n\r\n\r\nLastly, beware of appeasing nagging stakeholders by merely adding their “requirements” to the Product Backlog. This does not solve the issues; it just postpones the inevitable discussion as the stakeholders will now expect that the Scrum Team will create their Increment.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nAt what level do you include other team members in the refinement process?\nWhen the foundation of a Product Backlog item is ready for that. The readiness isn’t easy to generalize since it depends on the nature of the product itself, the Scrum Team’s experience, and the organization’s leadership style.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, this influences the readiness and availability of a Scrum Team to contribute to the refinement process effectively. For creating a shared understanding of the why, what, and how of a work item among all team members, the precise moment of involvement is crucial. If the team is involved too early, the Developers may consider this a waste of their time. If the Scrum Team is involved too late—for example, all specifications have already been prepared—, they may feel not respected. If in doubt, the Product Owner should include the Scrum Master in the process.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you identify the value of a Product Backlog item?\nSome proven categories to define value are projected revenue increase, cost cutting effects, a projected growth of the customer base, and an increase in customer satisfaction rates. \n\r\n\r\nMore metrics are available from Scrum.org’s Evidence-Based Management model.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you communicate to your team members the value of a backlog item?\nProduct Owners communicate value with any information suitable to further the Scrum Team’s understanding. That communication can be quantitative, such as analytical data describing how a process is utilized, financial projections, an increase in conversion rates, acquiring new customers, etc.) It can also be qualitative, such as transcripts, screencasts, or videos from a user testing session.\n\r\n\r\nPreferably, the Scrum Team members already know in advance as they are regularly participating in user research activities.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat are good practices to order Product Backlog items?\nCriteria to determine the order of a Product Backlog item, for example, are value, risk, work estimates, available expertise, and dependencies.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you handle bugs and technical debt when many valuable new features are competing for resources?\nFocusing solely on shipping new features is a slippery slope that quickly leads to the build-up of technical debt. You trade a short-term win—shipping more features—for a long-term liability. Technical debt will inevitably slow down the creature of new Product Increments in the future, probably to a point where the product seems to be at a standstill. \n\r\n\r\nIn other words: By accruing technical debt, the very purpose of becoming agile—learning faster as an organization than the competition, thus being able to exploit market opportunities—is at stake.\n\r\n\r\nHence it is a good practice to allocate around 20 percent of the Scrum Team’s capacity to keeping technical debt at bay at any given time. Experienced Product Owners support this long-term thinking.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhy is user story mapping a useful technique for Product Owners?\nUser story mapping a great way to visualize the “big picture” within a Product Backlog. Additionally, user story mapping is an instrumental means to improve communication with stakeholders and the Scrum Team. These workshops create a shared product understanding across teams, roles, and departments.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow do you best create Product Backlog items?\nThe best way to create Product Backlog items, particularly user stories, is a collaborative and iterative approach, using collective inspection and adaptation, including the whole Scrum Team. User story creation should not blindly follow a specific template but rather be a lively negotiation with the team, focusing on reaching a shared understanding of “why,” “what,” and “how” with all team members.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat shall a good user story look like? What is it structure?\nFor software development, the attributes of an exemplary user story are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThe description is available,\n\r\n\t\nAcceptance criteria are defined, \n\r\n\t\nThe story can be delivered within a Sprint, \n\r\n\t\nAll UI deliverables are available, \n\r\n\t\nAll (probable) dependencies are identified, \n\r\n\t\nPerformance criteria are defined, \n\r\n\t\nTracking criteria are defined and \n\r\n\t\nThe story is estimated by the team. (I do believe that you cannot “not estimate” one way or another. Even the #noestimate approach includes a sizing model that is based on a kind of unspoken estimation.) \n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners should be familiar with Ron Jeffries Three-Cs—Card, Conversation, Confirmation—and Bill Wake’s INVEST principle. \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhere are you discussing user stories, only during refinement sessions?\nThe best way to discuss a user story is by doing so synchronously with all involved team members to ensure that a shared understanding is created. This approach works for co-located as well as distributed Scrum Teams.\n\r\n\r\nAsynchronous discussions may be an option when team members cannot participate in a discussion or when the Product Owner is in the field, and feedback is required.\n\r\n\r\nIt would help if you avoided, though, lengthy discussions via comments on tickets. That’s a sign of a weak refinement process as it creates unnecessary queues of idleness. \n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhat are typical pitfalls of the Product Backlog refinement?\nSome of the typical pitfalls of a backlog refinement are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThere are not enough refinement sessions, resulting in a low quality of the Product Backlog. \r\n\t\nThere are too many refinement sessions, resulting in an overly detailed Product Backlog, resembling an upfront planning from the old waterfall planning ages. \r\n\t\nTurning requirement documents from stakeholders into user stories without involving the Scrum Team. \r\n\t\nNot involving the whole team in the refinement process, probably just the “lead engineer”. \r\n\t\nNot involving stakeholders. \r\n\n\r\n\r\nThis open question is an invitation to Product Owner candidates to share from their previous experience and how it influenced their current understanding of proper Product Backlog management.\n\r\n\r\nThere is an extensive list of anti-patterns available in the following article: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\nIs it necessary to include detailed acceptance criteria with a user-story?\nGenerally, acceptance criteria define the functional and non-functional requirements that need to be met. The level of detail may vary depending on the nature of the task. Hence, it is a good practice to include the Scrum Team in their creation as some of those requirements may already be addressed by the team’s Definition of Done.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nThe Scrum Team requires time to investigate a technical issue with a user story to understand its requirements better. How do you continue with the refinement process of the particular user story?\nBorrow from XP and run a spike during the next Sprint. Once the team can provide better insights to its technical side, come back to the user story, and resume the refinement.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nOne of your stakeholders presents you with such elaborate requirement documents that you copy them into Product Backlog items. Nevertheless, your Scrum Team is not pleased with this approach. Why is that?\nProduct Backlog items are a token for discussion to create a shared understanding and secure the Developers’ buy-in. If the Developers are not involved in devising, disseminating, and capturing these, they do not see any ownership in such work items. This likely results in a lower level of engagement, which may negatively affect the value created for customers.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nWhen would you remove a feature?\nThe best way to “remove” useless features is not to build them in the first place. Simplicity and radical focus on value delivered to customers is key to any successful agile product organization. \n\r\n\r\nShould—despite all validation efforts during product discovery—a feature of lesser value slip into the Product Backlog and be delivered, it should be removed as soon as possible from the live product. The same applies to an existing feature that has outlived its usefulness.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScrum Product Owner Interview Questions Set 6: Sprint Planning, Sprint, Sprint Review, and Retrospective\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth category that addresses the Sprint itself:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are pushing for a critical user story to be selected for the next Sprint. Unfortunately, the final front-end designs still are missing, but the designers promise to deliver no more than two days late into the Sprint. The Scrum Master, however, rejects this idea; the work item is not ready to be selected for a Sprint. What can you do?\nIt is a negotiation with the Scrum Team. The answer depends on the team’s situation and experience: If the designers are likely delivering—they have always kept their promises in the past—, and the Developers could accomplish the user story nevertheless within the Sprint, and the Developers agree with the situation, it is probably an acceptable exception.\nUltimately, the Scrum Team’s decision is whether to pick the work item for the next Sprint.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nDo you recommend that a Product Owner shall assign work items to individual members of the Scrum Team?\nThat is unacceptable behavior, as the Developers are self-organizing. Hence distributing tasks among themselves is their prerogative.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nShould the Product Owner attend the whole Sprint Planning?\r\nLet’s have a closer look at the Sprint Planning:\nThe Product Owner presents the business objective of the next Sprint to the Scrum Team. Collaboratively, the Scrum Team creates the Sprint Goal. The Developers then pick— considering all circumstances, for example, available capacity—those Product Backlog items they deem necessary to achieve the Sprint Goal. The presence of the Product Owner during this part of the Sprint Planning is essential.\nOften, the Developers now add details to the Sprint Backlog items, for example, splitting them up into tasks, identifying parts that need further clarification, or agreeing on who will be working on what tasks. Product Owners do not necessarily need to participate in this part of the Sprint Planning. But they need to be on stand-by for additional questions.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nShould the Product Owner attend the Daily Scrums?\nBy all means, yes. That way, the Product Owner can answer quickly, thus avoiding unnecessary delays.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYour Scrum Team, at least that is your impression, regularly estimates work items at the upper end of the possible range. You believe that they are playing safe, creating buffers for “rainy days.” How do you address this?\nTrust is the beginning of all. And the Developers do not trust the process, or the line management, or the stakeholders. This mistrust might be rooted in the organization’s culture, a former experience, or the work item’s quality. The team might also be too junior to understand some work items’ implications fully. Or the product is suffering from technical debt, which makes estimates generally more volatile.\nThe candidate should name some reasons for the behavior and suggest joining with the Scrum Master to provide the team with a path to let this habit go. The issue would make an outstanding topic for the Sprint Retrospective.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA stakeholder tends to broaden the scope of a user story in retrospect by claiming the Scrum Team did not deliver what was requested. How do you deal with that?\nThis kind of stakeholder behavior is not acceptable. It is the Product Owner’s objective to understand the scope of a feature request in advance clearly. Sneaking in features through the backdoor a typical Scrum anti-pattern that needs to be investigated and addressed.\nThis question opens the discussion on how to deal with selfish stakeholders, particularly in organizations that haven’t yet fully embraced the Product Owner concept.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nDoes the Product Owner have a veto when the release of Product Increments is concerned?\nThe Scrum Guide is not explicit about this situation. On the one side, the Scrum Team decides on when to release what Increment to the customers. On the other side, the Product Owner is “is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.”\nThis question opens the discussion on Scrum’s built-in checks and balances and how effective collaboration within the Scrum Team might work.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nDo you have to release every Product Increment that was finished during a Sprint?\n\r\nThe Scrum Team decides on when to release what Increment to the customers. There is no automatism for the release.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nHow would you organize the Sprint Review?\nIt is not the Product Owner’s task to organize the Sprint Review, but the whole Scrum Team should be eager to experience it. The Sprint Review is a critical opportunity to inspect the previous Sprint’s outcome and adapt the Product Backlog to serve the customers with the next Sprint best.\n\r\n\r\n\t\nDuring the Sprint Review, the Developers show new functionality you have never seen before. How do you react?\nThis behavior is undoubtedly an anti-pattern of a successful Scrum Team as it violates several Scrum principles, for example, providing transparency or adhering to openness and respect.\nFirst of all, Developers should never work on items the Product Owner does not know. Bypassing the Product Owner in that respect shows a significant deficit in understanding Scrum basics and should immediately be addressed in collaboration with the Scrum Master. (Learn more: Gold-Plating Beyond Done — Making Your Scrum Work #7.)\n\r\n\r\n\t\nAt the end of the Sprint, do you participate in the Retrospective?\nAbsolutely, Product Owners are members of the Scrum Team. Hence they participate in the Sprint Retrospective.\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n\r\nUpdate 2020-06-20: The Product Owner Interview Enhanced by Remote Scrum with Distributed Teams\n\r\n\r\nHow can we learn during the Product Owner interview whether a candidate has experience with facilitating remote agile events?\n\r\n\r\nTo figure out the candidate’s competence level, I like to run a Liberating Structures-based exercise during the interview. I use TRIZ to task the Product Owner candidate to come up with suggestions on how to sabotage a remote Scrum approach effectively when talking to teammates, internal stakeholders or customers. (Who is considering running user tests in person at the moment?)\n\r\n\r\nThese are some of the remote agile anti-patterns the candidate should be able to identify:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemote Agile is just standard work-life plus Zoom: Pretending that working remotely is the same as usual except for the video cameras. (This approach ignores all the challenges that distributed teams face, for example, not investing enough in getting to know each other better to build trust. We are Social animals and need to meet In person sooner or later to build lasting trust among teammates, thus creating psychological safety. Moreover, there are difficulties in reading the virtual room in general, which means that taking decisions to the team or calling out introverts manifest themselves differently in a remote working setup. Trust is the beginning of all; without it, transparency, inspection, and adaptation would be able to work their magic, and we end up as distributed feature factories.) \n\r\n\r\nNeither fish nor meat: Hybrid events create two classes of teammates — remote and co-located — where the co-located folks are calling the shots. (Beware of the distance bias—when out of sight means out of mind—thus avoiding the creation of a privileged subclass of teammates: “Distance biases have become all too common in today’s globalized world. They emerge in meetings when folks in the room fail to gather input from their remote colleagues, who may be dialing in on a conference line.” (Source.) To avoid this scenario, make sure that once a single participant joins remotely, all other participants “dial in,” too, to level the playing field.\n\r\n\r\nSurveillance: Trust won’t be built by surveilling and micro-managing team members. Therefore, don’t go rogue; the prime directive rules more than ever in a remote agile setup. Trust in people and do not spy on them — no matter how tempting it might be. (Read more about the damaging effect of a downward spiraling trust dynamic from Esther Derby.) https://www.estherderby.com/the-future-may-be-remote-must-it-include-surveillance/\n\r\n\r\n Mindless rituals: Leadership belief and or facilitation practices turn once useful routines into mindless rituals. (For example, think of Groundhog Day-style retrospectives over and over again. Answering the same three questions every single time is the easiest path to kill any form of creativity and collaboration. While this is hard to avoid in face-to-face environments, it requires much more dedication and energy in a remote agile setting.)\n\r\n\r\nDeath by PowerPoint: Meetings still revolve around an individual broadcasting a slide deck. (While you might get away with this approach for some time in face-2-face environments, it will not fly with distributed teams. Sessions need to inclusive, interactive, and engaging to entice collaboration, think Liberating Structures, and Training from the Back of the Room.)\n\r\n\r\nUnstructured communication: “Didn’t you get the memo?” (There is no clear practice on how to communicate which kind of information to whom. Are we talking about email, Slack, the team wiki, a Github comment, or the biweekly remote brow bag session? This lack of structure and agreement leads to stress—how can I avoid missing important news now that there is no longer a watercooler; do I have to monitor all Slack channels in real-time—and probably a feeling of being excluded. Maybe, this effect is just a missing update to the working agreement or team charter. But what if it is done deliberately? (Honi soit qui mal y pense.) in a remote agile environment always requires to overcommunicate and be completely transparent.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive list of anti-patterns, read Remote Agile (Part 4): Anti-Patterns — Pitfalls Successful Distributed Teams Avoid.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion: How to Use These 71 Scrum Product Owner Interview Questions\n \r\n\r\nScrum has always been a pragmatic business, and to succeed in this mindset, candidates need to have a passion for getting their hands dirty. While the basic rules are trivial, getting a group of individuals with different backgrounds, levels of engagement, and personal agendas, to continuously deliver value by creating a great product is challenging. The larger the organization is, the more management level there are, the more likely failure in one of its many forms is lurking around the corner.\n\r\n\r\nThe Product Owner interview questions are not necessarily suited to turn an inexperienced interviewer into an agile expert. However, they support figuring out what candidate has been working in the agile trenches and who’s more likely to be an imposter. (You should avoid inviting candidates from the latter category to a trial.)\n\r\n\r\nHence it’s probably a good idea to look for a pragmatic veteran who has experienced failure—and success—in other projects before and the scars to prove it.\n\r\n\r\nRegarding certifications of candidates, I recommend looking out for those with PSPO I, PSPO II, and particularly PSPO III certificates from Scrum.org.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n📖 Related Posts\n\r\n\r\n47 Scrum Master Interview Questions to Identify Suitable Candidates.\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owner Anti-Patterns — 31 Ways to Improve as a PO.\n\r\n\r\nPeer Recruiting: How to Hire a Scrum Master in Agile Times\n\r\n\r\n The Scrum Guide Reordered — understand the Scrum Guide’ patterns and concepts quickly to avoid hiring imposters.\n\r\n\r\n✋ Do Not Miss Out: Join the 9,000-plus Strong ‘Hands-on Agile’ Slack Team\n\r\nI invite you to join the “Hands-on Agile” Slack team and enjoy the benefits of a fast-growing, vibrant community of agile practitioners from around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like to join now all you have to do now is provide your credentials via this Google form, and I will sign you up.

It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s also the #1 thing that determines whether people will bother reading more about your product or hit the back button. On your site, your value proposition is the main thing you need to test — if you get it right, it will be a huge boost.”</blockquote><p>This is your key to winning the hearts of potential customers.</p><p>Include it everywhere and anywhere you get the chance to showcase your product.</p><ul><li><em>Pricing Page</em></li><li><em>Homepage</em></li><li><em>Facebook Ads</em></li><li><em>Emails… etc.</em></li></ul><p>Everywhere you know your potential customers will be looking at — put it there.</p><p>Take these big guys in the industry for example:</p><p><a href=\"http://hunte.io\">Hunter.io</a> makes good use of their UVP by promising to help you <em>“find professional email addresses in seconds”</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/986/0*Mzk5tn3Z6bgVWEsh\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a> aims to redefine what it means to have meetings — <em>“Engage new audiences, elevate customer experiences, and get more done together with our all-in-one communications platform”</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XBJHvxMbiEL6SbSx\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\">Duolingo</a> makes learning any language you want for free — <em>“Learn a language for free.

Finally, you compel them to refer others to generate even more leads.”</blockquote><p>Here’s the fun part they won’t tell you as a new founder.</p><p>For you to get your first 100 SaaS customers, you need to have a growth funnel — but you can’t have a growth funnel without first identifying the unique value proposition of your product.</p><p>The value your product provides and promises to your potential customer is what can either make or break you.</p><p>As a SaaS copywriter for a couple of years now, I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with a good amount of SaaS products.</p><p>And I’ve come to see why some founders succeed with their product, and some don’t — no matter how fascinating their products were.</p><p>Just like every SaaS copywriter in the industry, before taking on a project, you get a walk around on how the product works.</p><p>Also, their preferred ideal customer profile, buyer persona, and all sorts.</p><p>After being in loads of meetings with lots of these new founders, I noticed a common thing that later turned into a big problem.</p><h3><strong><em>New founders understand their products best and expect their customers should do the same</em></strong></h3><p>This is a big red flag and it’s the biggest mistake any new founder can make.</p><p>As much as all the technical jargon makes sense to you, your average user out there doesn’t care about it.</p><p>Instead, your first step to bridge the gap between you and potential customers is by creating a buyer persona.</p><p>And that’s the first step.</p><h3>1. Create A Buyer Persona</h3><p>Having a mental image of your preferred customer is what I recommend all new founders to have before even developing a product.</p><p>A buyer persona in this case is you picturing who you’d be comfortable sitting across with, listening to their problems, and showing how you can help.</p><p>Take, for instance, let’s say you have a product in mind — an <strong>Instagram hashtag analytics tool</strong>.</p><p>For this, you have lots of ideal markets —</p><ul><li><em>Content creators looking to expand their reach and visibility.</em></li><li><em>Real estate companies hoping to market their brands to customers looking for good homes</em></li><li><em>New fashion brands releasing different modern styles to catch the eye of their targeted audience etc.</em></li></ul><p>But here, let’s go for <strong>content creators.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem in the market</strong>: Instagram content creators complain of how difficult and time-consuming it is to find the perfect hashtags for their posts.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: They need a tool that provides befitting hashtags for each of their posts to increase their reach and engagement.</p><p>Simpler terms, <strong>organic increase in visibility, reach, and engagement on Instagram</strong>.</p><p><strong>Here’s how your buyer’s persona would look like on paper:</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/835/0*RDR578jqh6u6Mc1s\" /></figure><p><strong>Here’s how you interpret it in person to make it relatable:</strong></p><p><em>*For a demo, you can have a friend or colleague stand/sit with or across you so it’s more of a conversation… Trust me, it helps*</em></p><ul><li>Hi everyone, meet Janet McCarlson.</li><li>She’s a Model and Hair Stylist.</li><li>When she’s not busy at work, she likes taking photos of street fashion and posting on Instagram.</li><li>Janet wants to be a full-time Instagram content creator and influencer in the fashion niche.</li><li>She follows some of the popular influencers in the niche and wishes to be like them someday.</li><li>Even with her busy schedule, she tries uploading content at least 3 times a week.</li><li>After a while, she noticed that she wasn’t getting enough engagement on her content.</li><li>But no matter what she tried — whether it’s using hashtags, asking for shout-outs, or joining follows trains, none was working for her.</li><li>One day she was looking up ways which she could use to improve her engagement and found an Instagram hashtag analytics tool.</li><li>The tool promises to help increase her engagement, visibility, and reach by giving her proper hashtags for each of her posts.</li><li>At first, she wasn’t sure the tool would help because she felt she had tried everything.</li><li>But then she went through their content and felt they understood her problem.</li><li>Janet signed up for the free one-month trial.</li><li>After a week of using &lt;product name&gt;, her engagements increased by 75.4%.</li><li>By the end of the trial, she had increased her overall reach, engagement, and visibility by 432%.</li><li>Now Janet loves &lt;your product name&gt;, confident about it, and is willing to pay for it because it solves her problem.</li></ul><p><em>Now, you might want to spice it up a little depending on your preference but you get the idea I’m driving at…</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/278/0*VIbp_FtNy6wXChHN\" /></figure><p>Nonetheless, by creating and interpreting your buyer persona this way, you are a step closer to understanding how potential customers interact with your product.</p><p>With this, you can move to the next step of creating a clear customer journey roadmap.</p><h3>2. Create An Effective Customer Journey Roadmap</h3><p>If there’s one thing copywriting has taught me, it’s how to communicate effectively in the most basic human way possible.</p><p>However, most of these new founders don’t understand that aspect of “effective communication”.</p><p><em>At least not to the level that’s helpful.</em></p><p>And this is not their fault — rather, it’s due to how they’ve worked so much on and with their product to the extent where they know everything it does to the smallest bits.</p><p>Or to rephrase, they feel they know how it should help people based on their understanding — which is good.</p><p>But then, your potential customers don’t understand what your product does and why it’s important to them.</p><p>Before working with clients, I ask them if they have a customer journey roadmap.</p><p>Well, not most understand how it should be — or rather, how they should do it.</p><p>But here’s how I define it:</p><blockquote><strong>“Customer experience roadmap is the interaction a potential customer has with the product at every level of the customer’s journey to understand the unique value proposition it offers”.</strong></blockquote><p>According to Kasey Panetta of <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/\">Gartner</a> in an article on <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/how-to-create-an-effective-customer-Journey-map\">How to create an effective customer journey roadmap</a>, <strong>“Eighty-two percent of organizations have created a customer journey map, but only 47% are using those maps effectively.”</strong></p><p>With such low numbers, you should get an idea of why so many SaaS companies are struggling.</p><p>As a result, creating a customer journey roadmap gets your foot in the door without your prospects slamming it on your face before you get the chance to talk.</p><h3><strong>How to Create A Customer Journey Roadmap</strong></h3><p>In creating your customer journey roadmap, look at it as a detailed breakdown of your customer acquisition funnel.</p><p><em>Well, that’s what it is.</em></p><p>Typically, the journey of a customer is divided into 5 different stages namely: <strong>Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Retention, and Advocacy</strong>.</p><p>Here’s a simple process to help you out:</p><ul><li><em>Talk to your customers</em></li><li><em>Understand their needs</em></li><li><em>Map out their journey according to your buyer persona</em></li><li><em>Align your goals with your customers’ journey</em></li><li><em>Set up improvements plans</em></li><li><em>Set milestones and use quantitative metrics to measure your results</em></li></ul><p>When you piece it all together, you should have a framework that tackles the stages of customer acquisition.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><figure><img alt=\"Customer journey, and customer experience map\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dEZFR2aPgrjcrrXD\" /></figure><p>With a careful look at this roadmap, you’d notice how content is one of the key driving factors at each stage of the customer journey.</p><p>And Personally, content marketing and copywriting are one of the most effective ways I’ve found of converting leads to prospects and finally customers.</p><p>You probably might say I’m biased with that, but take a look at these stats 👇</p><p>In a recent survey that Alina Petrova of <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics/?kw=&amp;cmp=WW_SRCH_DSA_Blog_Core_BU_EN&amp;label=dsa_pagefeed&amp;Network=g&amp;Device=c&amp;utm_content=484277120801&amp;kwid=aud-973005362103:dsa-1053501813787&amp;cmpid=11776868584&amp;agpid=117384936394&amp;BU=Core&amp;extid=167369085596&amp;adpos=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwv_iEBhASEiwARoemvLckqEwMWDQz9TZXMHS_0mS3Jfr50_8aa0bBlN-CR12aGni7b5eW3xoCZ_wQAvD_BwE\">Semrush</a> conducted, 1,500 marketers from different countries analyzed 17,000 content marketing positions from 2019 to 2020 and they discovered some amazing results.</p><ul><li><strong>Over 80% preferred producing blog posts.</strong></li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/775/0*qGNedB75i9I2K8U_\" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Companies are prioritizing content creation with an increase from 53% to 81% in content writing outsourcing.</strong></li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/775/0*h7vHFEt4oLTKTves\" /></figure><ul><li><strong>69% of content created is for Top of the Funnel (ToFU), which implies that attracting traffic and generating quality leads is their primary goal.</strong></li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/775/0*ylOx7Zq8mtbZUdWu\" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Also, more companies are spending more on content marketing than they usually do.</strong></li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/774/0*PBtLCRLo03SNAMec\" /></figure><p>Quoting Alina —</p><blockquote>“Businesses are increasing their content marketing budgets. In order to achieve their content marketing goals, organizations are increasing their spending across the board — and expect to continue to do so in 2021. As an indicator, 47% of the respondents now spend more than $10k on their annual content marketing output, compared to just 38% in 2019.”</blockquote><p>Back to it, you see it’s just facts over feelings at this point.</p><p>With content marketing and copywriting in place, you’re able to pass your message directly to your ideal customer and answer all questions they might have.</p><p>As a potential customer looking for what products are on the market to solve my problems — the copy you have on your website is a deal-breaker.</p><p>It’s what determines if you’ll convert your leads or not.</p><p>But don’t take it from me, — take it from <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/author/garrett-hughes/\">Garrett Hughes</a> of <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/\">Unbounce</a> on how they’ve captured <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/news/introducing-conversion-intelligence/\">1 billion conversions</a>:</p><blockquote>“One way lots of us make up for the difficulties of optimization is by getting better at other aspects of marketing. We employ best practices — tactics for writing conversion-focused copy, or placing calls to action at just the right spot.”</blockquote><p>Garrett even goes further to confirm this:</p><blockquote>We’ve verified that <strong>your landing page copy is twice as important to conversion rates as your design</strong>. (That doesn’t mean the design isn’t crucial, too, but you’ll wanna make sure your copy is especially persuasive.)</blockquote><p>This gives you an insight into where your priorities should be. It doesn’t mean having a good design is bad, but having a crappy copy can’t be excused — unlike a crappy design.</p><p>But keep in mind, while writing your copy, your message doesn’t have to be complicated in any way.</p><p>Keep your copy simple and free of technical jargon.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*eddiXSsQ0QKnZbtl\" /></figure><p><em>Yeah, these guys get it</em></p><p>Personally, when working with clients, I’ve found the AIDCA technique to be the best for writing copy.</p><p>It’s more like the AIDA technique — <em>but with a little addition</em>.</p><p>If you’ve read this far, then it worked on you.</p><p>Here’s is how it looks:</p><p><strong>A — Attention</strong>: Grab potential customers’ attention to the product.</p><p><strong>I — Interest</strong>: Make them interested in what you have to offer by proffering a solution to their problems.</p><p><strong>D — Desire</strong>: Show them why your product is “better for them” than the competitor’s product.</p><p><strong>C — Confidence</strong>: Create a sense of confidence in your product as people won’t buy what they don’t trust.</p><p><strong>A — Action</strong>: Make them take an action right now — free trials, newsletters sign-ups, demos are a good start before they purchase.</p><p>With this technique, you can easily move your leads to prospects and finally customers.</p><p>Now, this will only work after you’ve identified your ideal buyer persona — and then, created a clear customer journey roadmap.</p><p>With all these in place, your message becomes clearer and easy to digest to take it to the next step.</p><h3><strong>3. Start Promoting…</strong></h3><p>Not a lot of new founders in SaaS understand the process of entering the market.</p><p>For some, they neglect the earlier steps and go right into promoting their products without having a good customer journey map.</p><p>As a new founder in the SaaS market, what you should understand is people are only after solutions.</p><p>That’s all — nothing else.</p><p>And with that, you only get customers if you provide working solutions, not with ads on Facebook or Google ads.</p><p>Now, using your customer journey roadmap, you should know where your customers hang out — and that’s where your promotion should take place.</p><h3><strong>When you think about it, it makes just so much sense to talk to people who will listen to you — rather than convincing those who wouldn’t.</strong></h3><p>In promoting your product, you can either use a free or paid form of advertising.</p><p>If you’re going to use the free method of advertising — forms such, content marketing and cold email outreach works well, but it takes a lot of time.</p><p>However, I’d recommend using a paid form of advertising on the platform(s) your potential customers are most active on.</p><p>Paid advertising — if done well — helps you get the traction you want quicker and easier, especially in your first year.</p><p>This is because you’re not trying to figure out if they’ll like your type of product or not. Instead, the platform you’re using already has the data to help put your product in front of potential customers.</p><p>Take for instance, if you are to promote the earlier product, <strong>Instagram Hashtag Analytics tool</strong> — your first thought will be using <strong>Instagram Ads</strong> and targeting <strong>content creators</strong>.</p><p><em>Something like this</em> 👇</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/738/0*eynLMmT_ZNjKIEcs\" /></figure><p>Or perhaps you want to expand and see how you can get in front of a larger audience with people who are looking for your key phrases or related ones on google.</p><p>Then you can use google ads.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/852/0*yQSSAQ9gXIZrFsti\" /></figure><p>Now, for the most part in this step, you’d have to come to notice that it’s more about the traction and making your product known.</p><p>When you succeed in getting this, your next move is converting those leads into customers.</p><p>To make the best use of this, you have to know that your audience might be skeptical at first since they don’t know much about your product.</p><p>This is why, in most cases with my clients, I recommend they offer any of these:</p><ul><li>Demo or</li><li>Free trials</li></ul><p>Personally, free trials give the best results — and that’s what I’ll be talking about in the next step.</p><h3><strong>4…And Follow It Up with A Free Trial</strong></h3><p>When it comes to launching products with free trials, most SaaS founders who have been in the space for a while seem to understand this part.</p><p>Yeah, <em>seem to understand</em> — not fully understand.</p><p>For some, it’s their first time launching their product — for others, it’s not.</p><p>When using free trials as your major form of converting your leads to potential customers, you need to understand that your audience is skeptical.</p><h3>Take this and let it stick, <strong><em>“consider your audience will be skeptical about your product until they purchase”.</em></strong></h3><p>Why should you consider them as being skeptical?</p><p>Well for starters, an estimation of <a href=\"https://virayo.com/saas/statistics/\">11,000 SaaS companies</a> is operating worldwide, and those are only the ones accounted for.</p><p>Several others are coming up every day, which should tell you the competition is fierce. Hence, leaving your prospects with plenty of options to choose from.</p><p>This makes it a priority for you as a new founder to find a way to show your potential customers how you’re trying to solve their problems.</p><p>Big SaaS companies like <a href=\"https://www.hootsuite.com/\">Hootsuite</a> for example still prefer to use free trials compared to demos.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EwOSs1kPIEaZT3Aw\" /></figure><p><em>Why’s that?</em></p><p>Well, the concept of a free trial is to remove the risk barrier most prospective customers face before buying a product.</p><p>This allows you as a new founder to eliminate all doubts — while helping them make an informed decision.</p><p>Nonetheless, before creating a free trial, you need to go back to your customer journey roadmap to be able to make the right decisions on the length of the free trial.</p><p>Taking <a href=\"https://www.hootsuite.com/\">Hootsuite</a> again as our example, a 30-day free trial is what they’ve decided to work with.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/918/0*wmPdWQ1ZRtdr-LTd\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/974/0*fbBOvx38cZAFGVtM\" /></figure><p>Now, this 30-day free trial didn’t just come off the top of their head.</p><p><em>Or maybe it did — that’s genius if it did.</em></p><p>Rather, it’s influenced by a series of factors that you as a new founder also need to consider.</p><p>Here are some of the key factors that should guide you in creating the perfect free trial length:</p><ul><li><em>Analyze customer usability before and after the onboarding process.</em></li><li><em>Measure the average time it takes for customers to understand the product.</em></li><li><em>Compare feature limitations with user’s satisfaction and interest.</em></li><li><em>Determine how different types of trial length affects your sales cycle.</em></li></ul><p>With all these factors, you should be able to decide what length is best for your SaaS product.</p><p>Personally, for most of the products I’ve worked with, the 30-day trial converts the best — <em>especially for B2B applications.</em></p><p>Which might make you ask — <em>Why should I create a 30-day trial if my product is simple to use?</em></p><p>As I always say, only your customers decide if your product is easy to use or not. If it’s not easy for your customers, it most definitely can’t be easy for you.</p><p>Hence why 30 days is enough for most users to decide to move to a paid version or not.</p><p>When you allow prospective customers to opt-in for a 30-day trial, you’re able to:</p><ul><li><em>Drive better conversions</em></li><li><em>Understand customers’ expectations and how to meet them</em></li><li><em>Build personal relationships on providing working solutions</em></li><li><em>Optimize user experience; and</em></li><li><em>Improve retention while reducing churn rates.</em></li></ul><p>With all of these, you have enough feedback and data to make the next step which is the most important one — and that is:</p><h3>5. Converting free users into paid ones.</h3><p>This is by far the single most important thing to a new SaaS founder. Well, not just new founders, practically everyone at this point in the SaaS industry.</p><p>And that is making profits.</p><p>No matter how you might try to sugarcoat it, no one wants to put together a team, work on it for months with countless sleepless nights, and then not get rewarded.</p><p>No one wants that.</p><p>The concept of SaaS is providing applicable solutions for everyone. As a result, its sustainability is built on how much revenue is available to keep it running.</p><p>This is why lots of people take different approaches when they get to this stage.</p><h3><strong>But what most fail to realize is, people don’t pay for products, they pay for solutions</strong>.</h3><p>So, if you’re not building a workable solution that’s easy to use, all efforts put in the previous steps will be futile.</p><p>Let’s go back to our <strong>Instagram hashtag analytics tool</strong> example — and for this, you want to convert your trial users to paid.</p><p>The first barrier is making sure all prospective customers understand how to effectively use the Instagram hashtag analytics tool after the 30-day trial.</p><p>Kicking off, you can start with segmenting the blog sections with topics aimed at how to use &lt;your tool&gt;

Everyone with their forks, knives, and spoons — all trying to get some.\nI want some — that’s why I’m a SaaS copywriter.\nYou want some — that’s why this article piqued your interest.\nAnd the whole existence of SaaS is to solve world problems — well not exactly like the avengers’ style, but with software. Hence, Software as A Service.\nYou name any problem in SaaS — and I’ll bet you 100 quid there’s a solution somewhere, either popular enough for you to find or perhaps lurking in the shadows — only if you look hard enough.\nBut hey, do any of us really want to endlessly scour the internet for hours just to find a single solution?\nHumm, I’d think NO!\nWell, that’s the problem SaaS startups face. They’ve got a great product, but getting customers is a big hassle for them.\nUsing the lingo, it’s called Customer Acquisition and it looks like this 👇.\n\nImage via 123Reg Blog\nNow looking at that, you see it’s a lot of stages before the actual purchase.\nAnd also, any fall-off before the purchase means you didn’t convert. So, what that means is, if your leads and prospects are not turning to customers, you’ve got a problem.\nWonder why that’s a problem?\nWell, for starters, every day, about 100 different SaaS products are being launched on Product Hunt — alone.\nThat’s a lot!\nAnd that’s just one of many — there are others like Angelist, Hacker News, The Startup Pitch, Launching Next, Feed My App, Beta Bound, etc.\nYour leads have lots of options to choose from when it comes to SaaS products, but what many new founders failed to realize is:\nFor your product to stand out, you need to have identified a Unique Value Proposition (UVP).\nAt every stage you interact with a customer, there should be a common driving factor that makes your product stand out.\nAnd that is your Unique Value Proposition (UVP).\nWith this, you’re telling your audience that you’ve identified a problem they’re facing, and now you have a solution.\nQuoting Peep Laja of CXL while talking about How to Create A Unique Value Proposition:\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you.\nIt’s also the #1 thing that determines whether people will bother reading more about your product or hit the back button. On your site, your value proposition is the main thing you need to test — if you get it right, it will be a huge boost.”\nThis is your key to winning the hearts of potential customers.\nInclude it everywhere and anywhere you get the chance to showcase your product.\n\nPricing Page\nHomepage\nFacebook Ads\nEmails… etc.\n\nEverywhere you know your potential customers will be looking at — put it there.\nTake these big guys in the industry for example:\nHunter.io makes good use of their UVP by promising to help you “find professional email addresses in seconds”.\n\nZoom aims to redefine what it means to have meetings — “Engage new audiences, elevate customer experiences, and get more done together with our all-in-one communications platform”.\n\nDuolingo makes learning any language you want for free — “Learn a language for free. Forever”.\n\nBack to you the new founder — you’re probably wondering, how do I do this?\nWell, here is how.\nWhen you’re communicating the unique value proposition of your SaaS product, have it at the back of your mind that it’s not about how fantastic your product is.\nInstead, consider how it makes their lives easier and better in the most convenient way possible.\nAt first, I didn’t quite understand the practical importance of the unique value proposition until I read Growth Marketing by Julian Shapiro (@julian on Twitter) — worth the read if you’re interested.\nOne thing I picked up was what he called the “The Growth Funnel”.\nHe broke this down into 5 stages:\n\nThen went ahead to define it like this:\n“This is the journey a customer takes through their experience interacting with your company: you acquire them as a lead, you convert them into a customer, then you keep them engaged to maximize their lifetime revenue. Finally, you compel them to refer others to generate even more leads.”\nHere’s the fun part they won’t tell you as a new founder.\nFor you to get your first 100 SaaS customers, you need to have a growth funnel — but you can’t have a growth funnel without first identifying the unique value proposition of your product.\nThe value your product provides and promises to your potential customer is what can either make or break you.\nAs a SaaS copywriter for a couple of years now, I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with a good amount of SaaS products.\nAnd I’ve come to see why some founders succeed with their product, and some don’t — no matter how fascinating their products were.\nJust like every SaaS copywriter in the industry, before taking on a project, you get a walk around on how the product works.\nAlso, their preferred ideal customer profile, buyer persona, and all sorts.\nAfter being in loads of meetings with lots of these new founders, I noticed a common thing that later turned into a big problem.\nNew founders understand their products best and expect their customers should do the same\nThis is a big red flag and it’s the biggest mistake any new founder can make.\nAs much as all the technical jargon makes sense to you, your average user out there doesn’t care about it.\nInstead, your first step to bridge the gap between you and potential customers is by creating a buyer persona.\nAnd that’s the first step.\n1. Create A Buyer Persona\nHaving a mental image of your preferred customer is what I recommend all new founders to have before even developing a product.\nA buyer persona in this case is you picturing who you’d be comfortable sitting across with, listening to their problems, and showing how you can help.\nTake, for instance, let’s say you have a product in mind — an Instagram hashtag analytics tool.\nFor this, you have lots of ideal markets —\n\nContent creators looking to expand their reach and visibility.\nReal estate companies hoping to market their brands to customers looking for good homes\nNew fashion brands releasing different modern styles to catch the eye of their targeted audience etc.\n\nBut here, let’s go for content creators.\nThe problem in the market: Instagram content creators complain of how difficult and time-consuming it is to find the perfect hashtags for their posts.\nSolution: They need a tool that provides befitting hashtags for each of their posts to increase their reach and engagement.\nSimpler terms, organic increase in visibility, reach, and engagement on Instagram.\nHere’s how your buyer’s persona would look like on paper:\n\nHere’s how you interpret it in person to make it relatable:\n*For a demo, you can have a friend or colleague stand/sit with or across you so it’s more of a conversation… Trust me, it helps*\n\nHi everyone, meet Janet McCarlson.\nShe’s a Model and Hair Stylist.\nWhen she’s not busy at work, she likes taking photos of street fashion and posting on Instagram.\nJanet wants to be a full-time Instagram content creator and influencer in the fashion niche.\nShe follows some of the popular influencers in the niche and wishes to be like them someday.\nEven with her busy schedule, she tries uploading content at least 3 times a week.\nAfter a while, she noticed that she wasn’t getting enough engagement on her content.\nBut no matter what she tried — whether it’s using hashtags, asking for shout-outs, or joining follows trains, none was working for her.\nOne day she was looking up ways which she could use to improve her engagement and found an Instagram hashtag analytics tool.\nThe tool promises to help increase her engagement, visibility, and reach by giving her proper hashtags for each of her posts.\nAt first, she wasn’t sure the tool would help because she felt she had tried everything.\nBut then she went through their content and felt they understood her problem.\nJanet signed up for the free one-month trial.\nAfter a week of using <product name>, her engagements increased by 75.4%.\nBy the end of the trial, she had increased her overall reach, engagement, and visibility by 432%.\nNow Janet loves <your product name>, confident about it, and is willing to pay for it because it solves her problem.\n\nNow, you might want to spice it up a little depending on your preference but you get the idea I’m driving at…\n\nNonetheless, by creating and interpreting your buyer persona this way, you are a step closer to understanding how potential customers interact with your product.\nWith this, you can move to the next step of creating a clear customer journey roadmap.\n2. Create An Effective Customer Journey Roadmap\nIf there’s one thing copywriting has taught me, it’s how to communicate effectively in the most basic human way possible.\nHowever, most of these new founders don’t understand that aspect of “effective communication”.\nAt least not to the level that’s helpful.\nAnd this is not their fault — rather, it’s due to how they’ve worked so much on and with their product to the extent where they know everything it does to the smallest bits.\nOr to rephrase, they feel they know how it should help people based on their understanding — which is good.\nBut then, your potential customers don’t understand what your product does and why it’s important to them.\nBefore working with clients, I ask them if they have a customer journey roadmap.\nWell, not most understand how it should be — or rather, how they should do it.\nBut here’s how I define it:\n“Customer experience roadmap is the interaction a potential customer has with the product at every level of the customer’s journey to understand the unique value proposition it offers”.\nAccording to Kasey Panetta of Gartner in an article on How to create an effective customer journey roadmap, “Eighty-two percent of organizations have created a customer journey map, but only 47% are using those maps effectively.”\nWith such low numbers, you should get an idea of why so many SaaS companies are struggling.\nAs a result, creating a customer journey roadmap gets your foot in the door without your prospects slamming it on your face before you get the chance to talk.\nHow to Create A Customer Journey Roadmap\nIn creating your customer journey roadmap, look at it as a detailed breakdown of your customer acquisition funnel.\nWell, that’s what it is.\nTypically, the journey of a customer is divided into 5 different stages namely: Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Retention, and Advocacy.\nHere’s a simple process to help you out:\n\nTalk to your customers\nUnderstand their needs\nMap out their journey according to your buyer persona\nAlign your goals with your customers’ journey\nSet up improvements plans\nSet milestones and use quantitative metrics to measure your results\n\nWhen you piece it all together, you should have a framework that tackles the stages of customer acquisition.\nHere’s an example:\n\nWith a careful look at this roadmap, you’d notice how content is one of the key driving factors at each stage of the customer journey.\nAnd Personally, content marketing and copywriting are one of the most effective ways I’ve found of converting leads to prospects and finally customers.\nYou probably might say I’m biased with that, but take a look at these stats 👇\nIn a recent survey that Alina Petrova of Semrush conducted, 1,500 marketers from different countries analyzed 17,000 content marketing positions from 2019 to 2020 and they discovered some amazing results.\n\nOver 80% preferred producing blog posts.\n\nCompanies are prioritizing content creation with an increase from 53% to 81% in content writing outsourcing.\n\n69% of content created is for Top of the Funnel (ToFU), which implies that attracting traffic and generating quality leads is their primary goal.\n\nAlso, more companies are spending more on content marketing than they usually do.\n\nQuoting Alina —\n“Businesses are increasing their content marketing budgets. In order to achieve their content marketing goals, organizations are increasing their spending across the board — and expect to continue to do so in 2021. As an indicator, 47% of the respondents now spend more than $10k on their annual content marketing output, compared to just 38% in 2019.”\nBack to it, you see it’s just facts over feelings at this point.\nWith content marketing and copywriting in place, you’re able to pass your message directly to your ideal customer and answer all questions they might have.\nAs a potential customer looking for what products are on the market to solve my problems — the copy you have on your website is a deal-breaker.\nIt’s what determines if you’ll convert your leads or not.\nBut don’t take it from me, — take it from Garrett Hughes of Unbounce on how they’ve captured 1 billion conversions:\n“One way lots of us make up for the difficulties of optimization is by getting better at other aspects of marketing. We employ best practices — tactics for writing conversion-focused copy, or placing calls to action at just the right spot.”\nGarrett even goes further to confirm this:\nWe’ve verified that your landing page copy is twice as important to conversion rates as your design. (That doesn’t mean the design isn’t crucial, too, but you’ll wanna make sure your copy is especially persuasive.)\nThis gives you an insight into where your priorities should be. It doesn’t mean having a good design is bad, but having a crappy copy can’t be excused — unlike a crappy design.\nBut keep in mind, while writing your copy, your message doesn’t have to be complicated in any way.\nKeep your copy simple and free of technical jargon.\n\nYeah, these guys get it\nPersonally, when working with clients, I’ve found the AIDCA technique to be the best for writing copy.\nIt’s more like the AIDA technique — but with a little addition.\nIf you’ve read this far, then it worked on you.\nHere’s is how it looks:\nA — Attention: Grab potential customers’ attention to the product.\nI — Interest: Make them interested in what you have to offer by proffering a solution to their problems.\nD — Desire: Show them why your product is “better for them” than the competitor’s product.\nC — Confidence: Create a sense of confidence in your product as people won’t buy what they don’t trust.\nA — Action: Make them take an action right now — free trials, newsletters sign-ups, demos are a good start before they purchase.\nWith this technique, you can easily move your leads to prospects and finally customers.\nNow, this will only work after you’ve identified your ideal buyer persona — and then, created a clear customer journey roadmap.\nWith all these in place, your message becomes clearer and easy to digest to take it to the next step.\n3. Start Promoting…\nNot a lot of new founders in SaaS understand the process of entering the market.\nFor some, they neglect the earlier steps and go right into promoting their products without having a good customer journey map.\nAs a new founder in the SaaS market, what you should understand is people are only after solutions.\nThat’s all — nothing else.\nAnd with that, you only get customers if you provide working solutions, not with ads on Facebook or Google ads.\nNow, using your customer journey roadmap, you should know where your customers hang out — and that’s where your promotion should take place.\nWhen you think about it, it makes just so much sense to talk to people who will listen to you — rather than convincing those who wouldn’t.\nIn promoting your product, you can either use a free or paid form of advertising.\nIf you’re going to use the free method of advertising — forms such, content marketing and cold email outreach works well, but it takes a lot of time.\nHowever, I’d recommend using a paid form of advertising on the platform(s) your potential customers are most active on.\nPaid advertising — if done well — helps you get the traction you want quicker and easier, especially in your first year.\nThis is because you’re not trying to figure out if they’ll like your type of product or not. Instead, the platform you’re using already has the data to help put your product in front of potential customers.\nTake for instance, if you are to promote the earlier product, Instagram Hashtag Analytics tool — your first thought will be using Instagram Ads and targeting content creators.\nSomething like this 👇\n\nOr perhaps you want to expand and see how you can get in front of a larger audience with people who are looking for your key phrases or related ones on google.\nThen you can use google ads.\n\nNow, for the most part in this step, you’d have to come to notice that it’s more about the traction and making your product known.\nWhen you succeed in getting this, your next move is converting those leads into customers.\nTo make the best use of this, you have to know that your audience might be skeptical at first since they don’t know much about your product.\nThis is why, in most cases with my clients, I recommend they offer any of these:\n\nDemo or\nFree trials\n\nPersonally, free trials give the best results — and that’s what I’ll be talking about in the next step.\n4…And Follow It Up with A Free Trial\nWhen it comes to launching products with free trials, most SaaS founders who have been in the space for a while seem to understand this part.\nYeah, seem to understand — not fully understand.\nFor some, it’s their first time launching their product — for others, it’s not.\nWhen using free trials as your major form of converting your leads to potential customers, you need to understand that your audience is skeptical.\nTake this and let it stick, “consider your audience will be skeptical about your product until they purchase”.\nWhy should you consider them as being skeptical?\nWell for starters, an estimation of 11,000 SaaS companies is operating worldwide, and those are only the ones accounted for.\nSeveral others are coming up every day, which should tell you the competition is fierce. Hence, leaving your prospects with plenty of options to choose from.\nThis makes it a priority for you as a new founder to find a way to show your potential customers how you’re trying to solve their problems.\nBig SaaS companies like Hootsuite for example still prefer to use free trials compared to demos.\n\nWhy’s that?\nWell, the concept of a free trial is to remove the risk barrier most prospective customers face before buying a product.\nThis allows you as a new founder to eliminate all doubts — while helping them make an informed decision.\nNonetheless, before creating a free trial, you need to go back to your customer journey roadmap to be able to make the right decisions on the length of the free trial.\nTaking Hootsuite again as our example, a 30-day free trial is what they’ve decided to work with.\n\nNow, this 30-day free trial didn’t just come off the top of their head.\nOr maybe it did — that’s genius if it did.\nRather, it’s influenced by a series of factors that you as a new founder also need to consider.\nHere are some of the key factors that should guide you in creating the perfect free trial length:\n\nAnalyze customer usability before and after the onboarding process.\nMeasure the average time it takes for customers to understand the product.\nCompare feature limitations with user’s satisfaction and interest.\nDetermine how different types of trial length affects your sales cycle.\n\nWith all these factors, you should be able to decide what length is best for your SaaS product.\nPersonally, for most of the products I’ve worked with, the 30-day trial converts the best — especially for B2B applications.\nWhich might make you ask — Why should I create a 30-day trial if my product is simple to use?\nAs I always say, only your customers decide if your product is easy to use or not. If it’s not easy for your customers, it most definitely can’t be easy for you.\nHence why 30 days is enough for most users to decide to move to a paid version or not.\nWhen you allow prospective customers to opt-in for a 30-day trial, you’re able to:\n\nDrive better conversions\nUnderstand customers’ expectations and how to meet them\nBuild personal relationships on providing working solutions\nOptimize user experience; and\nImprove retention while reducing churn rates.\n\nWith all of these, you have enough feedback and data to make the next step which is the most important one — and that is:\n5. Converting free users into paid ones.\nThis is by far the single most important thing to a new SaaS founder. Well, not just new founders, practically everyone at this point in the SaaS industry.\nAnd that is making profits.\nNo matter how you might try to sugarcoat it, no one wants to put together a team, work on it for months with countless sleepless nights, and then not get rewarded.\nNo one wants that.\nThe concept of SaaS is providing applicable solutions for everyone. As a result, its sustainability is built on how much revenue is available to keep it running.\nThis is why lots of people take different approaches when they get to this stage.\nBut what most fail to realize is, people don’t pay for products, they pay for solutions.\nSo, if you’re not building a workable solution that’s easy to use, all efforts put in the previous steps will be futile.\nLet’s go back to our Instagram hashtag analytics tool example — and for this, you want to convert your trial users to paid.\nThe first barrier is making sure all prospective customers understand how to effectively use the Instagram hashtag analytics tool after the 30-day trial.\nKicking off, you can start with segmenting the blog sections with topics aimed at how to use <your tool> to solve this kind of problem.\nTopic ideas could be:\n\nHow to achieve organic growth by getting your Instagram posts in the Top posts\nComplete guide on using Instagram hashtags for organic growth\nHow to find the best niche hashtags for your Instagram posts in 5 mins.\n\nNow, to take this up a notch, you pair it perfectly with your free trial, and here’s how to make it work.\nWhen a prospect signs up for a free trial, there’s a process called the onboarding process.\nThe onboarding process is where you show your free trial how to use your product, and what each feature does to help solve their problems.\nMore like your tour guide — buy online.\nIn every step of the onboarding, make sure there are at least 2–3 blog posts that cover some of your key features extensively.\nAfter this, you should have an indoctrination sequence that spans 30 days.\nThis Indoctrination sequence is more like your onboarding process, but longer and specific.\nWith this, you send your trial users an email every day for 30 days, explaining and showing examples of how to use your product to get their desired results.\nThis way, they are not just organically growing their Instagram but also understanding how to make the best use of your product.\nAfter they are done with the 30-day trial, they ideally have results at this point that’s enough to convert them into a paying customer.\nAnd there you have it — your customer!\nThere are also different ways you could achieve this if you don’t want to go all out by using blogs.\nTake another example from Neil Patel.\nNeil Patel uses his YouTube and blog to convert potential customers into paying ones by teaching them Search Engine Optimization and how to use his tool — Ubersuggest for it.\nWith YouTube, he has an SEO course that teaches you “how to get a flood of online traffic without spending $1 day!”\n\nFor his blog, he goes in-depth on how to use Ubersuggest to solve common SEO problems.\nTake this article for example — How to use Lucrative Keywords in Question Form to Answer Users’ Queries\n\nIf perhaps you’re a trial user or paid, and you come across this article here’s what happens.\nAs you scroll down and read through the article, you’re introduced to how to better use Ubersuggest for this purpose.\n\nSo, do you get the idea?\nIt’s more about making your users understand your product and how to use it to solve their problems.\nAlso, one popular thing common in SaaS I think because you’re a new product, you need to beat down the price lower than their competitors.\nAlthough, that might attract users at first, if what they get can’t match up to what they had, they won’t mind returning.\nYou have to know that, no matter how low your SaaS product costs, if it’s not benefitting enough, people won’t mind paying a higher price for a better one.\nAnd there you have it, all I’ve learned as a SaaS copywriter about getting your first 100 SaaS customers.\nBut hey… Let’s Recap\nFor you to be able to create a successful SaaS product, you need first to identify a problem that needs a solution — and then create it.\nHalf the time, lots of founders create solutions to problems that don’t exist. And in some cases, problems are personal to them but want to generalize them.\nNot saying this is bad…\nI mean, it’s totally fine to create a product for yourself to make things easier. But it doesn’t work like that in business.\nRather, try using this simple process before starting your next product:\n\nIdentify a problem in the market.\nLook for an audience facing that problem — and make sure it’s in good quantity.\nProffer a working solution and run a market survey on your already identified audience.\nCollate your survey of the market and use it to readjust your solution\nDo another survey with your adjusted solution for your audience.\nCompare your results and use them to identify the stages your potential customers are.\nCreate different buyer personas for each stage.\nUse your buyer persona to create a close estimate of your customer journey roadmap\nNow, you can develop your product.\n\nHere’s an infographic to make it simple:\n\nIf you’re able to figure out at least 80% of this before launching your product, your chances are significantly higher for success.\nAs you go on, the more you understand what your customers want, the more rewarding it’ll be for both your long and short-term goals.\nAnd if you’ve read this far, then I’m sure you must have gained something — so please put it to use.\nPS: If perhaps you need content or copy that communicates your message clearer to your audience, feel free to visit my website or simply reach out to me and tell me how you want me to help.\n\nHow to Get Your First 100 SaaS Customers In 5 Easy Steps was originally published in The Startup on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Joseph Ayomide","guid":"https://medium.com/p/1a4b0242c317","categories":["startup","business","marketing","saas","entrepreneurship"],"isoDate":"2021-05-29T05:17:46.000Z"},{"creator":"Samir Saeed","title":"Two Rules That New Creators Must Know to Stay Relevant in 2021 & Beyond","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/two-rules-that-new-creators-must-know-to-stay-relevant-in-2021-beyond-dae49e509eea?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Sat, 29 May 2021 02:17:44 GMT","dc:creator":"Samir Saeed","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/two-rules-that-new-creators-must-know-to-stay-relevant-in-2021-beyond-dae49e509eea?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*AoWfMsT0jJR-DQTq\" width=\"6000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">The game is always changing.

Yet, the technology at the forefront of them all is without a doubt the smartphone. By combining mobile telephone and computing functions within a singular multi-purpose device, smartphones have brought about a profound scale of mobility and accessibility with one-stop services that empower consumers across every aspect of their daily lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may look back fondly on the good old days of the mobile phone, when voice calls and text messaging were all we had access to, in the absence of addictive social media platforms and the seemingly endless barrage of notifications we receive nowadays. Nonetheless, the instantaneous connectivity of ever-improving mobile networks and increasingly diverse applications of smartphones will undeniably continue to bring value to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a forecast by vivo, one of the leading smartphone makers, demand for 5G devices is catching up to the entirety of the smartphone market as researchers recorded exponential growth between 2020 and 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"926\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure1_May2021.png?w=926\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025562\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure1_May2021.png 926w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure1_May2021.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure1_May2021.png?resize=768,450 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another report, published by Gartner, showed that the worldwide demand for smartphones with 5G capabilities more than doubled this year. “In 2020, consumers reduced spending on smartphones, but the availability of new products will see users drive significant uptick in demand in 2021. Lower-end 5G smartphones, which are becoming more prevalent outside China, are poised to drive more momentum for 5G smartphones in 2021 across all regions,” said Anshul Gupta, senior research director at Gartner. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"886\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure2_May2021.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025563\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure2_May2021.png 886w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure2_May2021.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vivo_Figure2_May2021.png?resize=768,353 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>How did we get to where we are today, and how did smartphone brands take us here? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Defining the fifth generation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5G is the latest global wireless standard, otherwise known as the 5th generation of cellular mobile communication technology. Compared to 4G LTE technology, 5G increases flux density a hundredfold and connection density tenfold. This allows for a new kind of digital infrastructure that can connect virtually everything and everyone via peak data transmission speeds with minimal latency to provide a uniform experience to us all, culminating in higher efficiency and optimized performance to empower new user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of industries are becoming integrated, owing to the reliable and streamlined network between machines, devices, and other digital objects. With many creative applications ranging from augmented reality/virtual reality experiences to vehicle-to-everything driverless cars and many more, 5G will provide humankind with the foundation to establish smart cities with comprehensive internet-of-things technologies that can efficiently restructure our lived environments and redefine our everyday lifestyles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It goes without saying that 5G can facilitate limitless applications, on both industrial and consumer levels.

Unbeknownst to many, battles are fought and alliances are formed every day as companies cannibalize each other in the race to hold the most patents for 5G technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vivo, one of the top players, has participated in the 3GPP 5G standard formulation for over five years. As one of many companies that set their sights on 5G technology, vivo established special 5G task forces back in December 2016 across Beijing and Shenzhen, China. One month later, vivo made its debut at the 2017 3GPP meeting. Since then, vivo has submitted over 5,000 5G proposals to the 3GPP, leading to 15 technical features and getting three technical projects approved. With more than 100 global standard experts staffed at its communication research institute, vivo now holds over 3,000 patents for 5G inventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>User-oriented innovation </strong><strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a leading smartphone company with in-depth R&amp;D capabilities, vivo is dedicated to accelerating the empowerment of consumers en masse in this new era by designing cutting-edge 5G smartphones that are available at every price point. Having amassed over 400 million users worldwide, vivo has a deep understanding of evolving consumer demands and strives to bridge users with the digital world by becoming one of the leading contributors to 5G technology in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The main gateway for consumers to indulge in the new digital era must be the most accessible, portable, cost-effective, and readily available digital device of them all: the smartphone. A leader in both smartphone manufacturing and 5G connectivity, vivo has been designing a diverse lineup of products that are ready for the next generation of connectivity to bring joy to users worldwide at modest price points,” says Rakesh Tamrakar, 5G standards expert at vivo.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamrakar has 20 years of experience in the mobile communications industry. He is one of the lead delegates representing vivo in the 3GPP, holds numerous patents, and has chaired multiple 3GPP RAN1 sessions&nbsp;(which specify the physical layer of radio interfaces)&nbsp;that led to the successful standardization of MIMO, NR on unlicensed spectrum technologies.&nbsp;Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a key 5G technology that&nbsp;increases throughput and signal-to-noise ratio, while NR is a new radio interface and radio access technology for cellular networks.&nbsp;He has authored and contributed numerous technical papers on the subject of 3GPP RAN1 in 3G, 4G, and 5G standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Brought to life by our strong R&amp;D network across nine innovation centers and supported by research teams across the globe, vivo knows consumers best within the industry. We focus on innovations in hardware design and the software ecosystem to improve terminal performance and user experiences. Putting end users at the center of everything we do, vivo invests heavily into 5G connectivity to reach the stage of product realization and getting this technology into the hands of consumers,” he adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5G research, standardization, and industrialization by vivo</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vivo’s unique user-oriented innovation is the genesis behind its numerous patented contributions to 5G standards, many of which have been universally acclaimed at the 3GPP meeting and are currently already being adapted for everyday smartphone users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of vivo’s most notable contributions includes the standardization and performance enhancement of Rel-17 multi-SIM technology. Previously, an incoming voice call from one competing 5G SIM card would interrupt the data flow of the other, resulting in abysmal performance as one would cancel the other. Having discovered early on that consumers had a preference for 5G smartphones with dual-SIM card slots for greater flexibility in different usage scenarios, vivo researchers successfully sought to negate the clash, leading to the existence of multi-SIM 5G smartphones on the market today. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial implementation of 5G technology was initially found to be quite resource-draining compared to devices running on 4G. However, consumers had grown accustomed to the substantial usage time allowed by previous smartphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always innovating with the user in mind, the Rel-16 terminal power-saving technology patented by vivo manages to simplify terminal actions. It lowers normal energy consumption by creating a new “dozing” state, allowing the device software to become inactive while the hardware becomes idle. 5G smartphones can now intelligently catch every chance to take a rest, thereby prolonging battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, vivo underwent algorithm and system optimization to facilitate this technology, combined with 120-watt fast charging to ensure complete user satisfaction with their devices.

Along with leading companies, research groups, and academic institutions, this combined elite collective is expected to reach a consensus on the ideation and requirements for this future generation of connectivity. To kickstart this exciting new era, the vivo Communications Research Institute (VCRI) released two white papers in late 2020 that break down the facets of 6G technology. Providing a diverse set of hypothetical scenarios and case studies, vivo communication standard experts have analyzed how the sixth generation will embody much more than technological transformation as it merges our physical and digital worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Currently, mobile infrastructure is still relatively isolated from the physical world, existing solely as an auxiliary tool for consumer usage. An extreme degree of seamlessness will be required to dynamically connect our physical surrounding with the omnipresent digital systems. In 2030 and beyond, 6G standard technologies will begin to foster a ubiquitous, sophisticated, real-time, and fully integrated digital world. This new realm will revolutionize thousands of industries with an extraordinary variety of applications to result in an efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly future world,” says Tamrakar. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6G communication systems will comprise many device terminals to realize the agile perception and accurate control between digital systems with our physical domain; this is comparable to the nerve endings that perceive essential information from every inch of the human body for our central nervous system to take responsive measures.

Yet, the technology at the forefront of them all is without a doubt the smartphone. By combining mobile telephone and computing functions within a singular multi-purpose device, smartphones have brought about a profound scale of mobility and accessibility with one-stop services that empower consumers across every aspect of their daily lives.\nSome may look back fondly on the good old days of the mobile phone, when voice calls and text messaging were all we had access to, in the absence of addictive social media platforms and the seemingly endless barrage of notifications we receive nowadays. Nonetheless, the instantaneous connectivity of ever-improving mobile networks and increasingly diverse applications of smartphones will undeniably continue to bring value to users.\nAccording to a forecast by vivo, one of the leading smartphone makers, demand for 5G devices is catching up to the entirety of the smartphone market as researchers recorded exponential growth between 2020 and 2021.\n\nAnother report, published by Gartner, showed that the worldwide demand for smartphones with 5G capabilities more than doubled this year. “In 2020, consumers reduced spending on smartphones, but the availability of new products will see users drive significant uptick in demand in 2021. Lower-end 5G smartphones, which are becoming more prevalent outside China, are poised to drive more momentum for 5G smartphones in 2021 across all regions,” said Anshul Gupta, senior research director at Gartner. \n\nHow did we get to where we are today, and how did smartphone brands take us here? \nDefining the fifth generation\n5G is the latest global wireless standard, otherwise known as the 5th generation of cellular mobile communication technology. Compared to 4G LTE technology, 5G increases flux density a hundredfold and connection density tenfold. This allows for a new kind of digital infrastructure that can connect virtually everything and everyone via peak data transmission speeds with minimal latency to provide a uniform experience to us all, culminating in higher efficiency and optimized performance to empower new user experiences.\nHundreds of thousands of industries are becoming integrated, owing to the reliable and streamlined network between machines, devices, and other digital objects.

While the Western world was struggling, India was relatively unscathed, hitting a high of about 1,300 deaths per day in late September 2020 before bottoming out again. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that the country had <a href=\"https://thewire.in/politics/bjp-bihar-elections-coronavirus-defeat\">won its battle</a> against the virus. In a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum’s Davos Dialogue on January 28, Modi boasted about&nbsp; India’s “proactive public participation approach, [its] covid-specific health infrastructure, and [its] trained resources to fight covid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, with vaccinations beginning to ramp up and cases continuing to fall, mitigation efforts were relaxed for what turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/4/29/indias-deadly-virus-surge-follows-crowded-events\">catastrophic superspreader events in late March and early April:</a> the Kumbh Mela (a major Hindu pilgrimage to India’s four sacred rivers) and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/56858980\">giant election rallies</a> in the states of West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, and Tamil Nadu. These crowded events attracted thousands of unmasked people who had traveled to get there. Within weeks, the hospital system collapsed; this month has been the deadliest yet in India’s fight against the coronavirus, putting the country just below Brazil and the US overall. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/india-covid-cases.html\">Over 311,000 Indians have died </a>from covid so far, according to official sources—but the true death toll is believed to be far higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in other places, people are struggling to cope with these deaths at a time when traditional ways of grieving have been ripped apart. Natasha Mickles, a professor of religious studies at Texas State University, where she studies Hindu and Buddhist death rituals, says that millennia-old traditions have had to be ignored. “Traditionally, in Hinduism and Jainism, the eldest son is responsible for lighting the funeral pyre,” Mickles says. But covid’s infectiousness and fatality rate mean that the eldest son is often not available or, worse, dead. That means families are having to figure out how to cremate or bury their family member while already overwhelmed with the task of notifying relatives about the death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Death rituals are some of the most conservative parts of culture,” Mickles says. “A lot of them are so ingrained that they require cultural cataclysms to change. We’re seeing that with the pandemic raging. We’re seeing a transformation in how we grieve.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">476 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Funerals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Funerals</a> In One Day In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kanpur?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Kanpur</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID</a>-19 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/victims?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#victims</a> being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cremated?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cremated</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bhairav?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bhairav</a> Ghat Hindu Crematory, as coronavirus cases surge in record numbers across the country, in Kanpur. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SecondCOVIDWave?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SecondCOVIDWave</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/up78?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#up78</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoronaUpdate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CoronaUpdate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoronavirusIndia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CoronavirusIndia</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoronaCurfew?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CoronaCurfew</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/photojournalistarun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#photojournalistarun</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LBtzsKwcte\">pic.twitter.com/LBtzsKwcte</a></p>&mdash; Arun Sharma (@ARUNSHARMAJI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ARUNSHARMAJI/status/1385439504136237067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Online spaces have offered a crucial forum for expressing grief and venting anger about the Indian government’s handling of the crisis. Families that have faced loss are sharing their pain in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/families-of-jaipur-golden-dead-form-whatsapp-group-delhi-covid-7316655/\">WhatsApp groups</a>. In mutual aid organizations that are crowdsourcing help, volunteers can barely process their grief for those who have died as they race to organize help for the next person. Twitter has become a steady stream of obituaries; one grieving woman’s plea to Modi to allow for mercy killings has gone viral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Digital/Our%20Insights/Digital%20India%20Technology%20to%20transform%20a%20connected%20nation/MGI-Digital-India-Report-April-2019.pdf\">smartphones</a> are widespread in India at all socioeconomic levels, digital literacy and the ability to connect online are still linked to wealth and privilege—meaning that only a certain segment of the population is able to grieve online.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>“I haven’t seen anything on this scale of pandemic grief ever,” says Shah Alam Khan, an orthopedic oncologist and professor at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Previously, you saw numbers of people who died from covid. Now, there are names. Each and every one of us knows someone who has been taken away by covid. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t know someone who’s died.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Khan’s hospital alone, he is seeing doctors so overwhelmed with grief that they are falling apart themselves. Just recently,&nbsp;after an eighth unsuccessful resuscitation attempt, a colleague killed himself in his office. It’s a death that Khan speaks of quietly: he admits he hasn’t wrapped his head around it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When death happens in our deeply religious society, grief becomes more a part of tradition than anything else,” he says. “I am atheist, but in this country, death and grieving are easier if you are a spiritual person.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seema Hari has been one of countless people using the Stories feature on Instagram to share resources such as Google Docs with information about where to find oxygen tanks, focusing on her native Mumbai. But as members of her own family have fallen ill with covid, she’s tumbled into grief, isolated save for her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I spent most of my days worrying and trying to share resources with people, and nights checking in via WhatsApp—not just with my family but with other friends all over India, asking them the dreaded question of whether everyone on their side is okay and if they need any help,” she said via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hari said she hasn’t felt the ability to grieve properly and doesn’t see herself doing so: “There is so much collective and personal grief to process, but it is almost like we have not even been afforded the privilege to grieve, because loss is so relentless and so many things demand our action and attention.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COetu0BpwN2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;

While the Western world was struggling, India was relatively unscathed, hitting a high of about 1,300 deaths per day in late September 2020 before bottoming out again. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that the country had won its battle against the virus. In a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum’s Davos Dialogue on January 28, Modi boasted about  India’s “proactive public participation approach, [its] covid-specific health infrastructure, and [its] trained resources to fight covid.”\nThen, with vaccinations beginning to ramp up and cases continuing to fall, mitigation efforts were relaxed for what turned out to be catastrophic superspreader events in late March and early April: the Kumbh Mela (a major Hindu pilgrimage to India’s four sacred rivers) and giant election rallies in the states of West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, and Tamil Nadu. These crowded events attracted thousands of unmasked people who had traveled to get there. Within weeks, the hospital system collapsed; this month has been the deadliest yet in India’s fight against the coronavirus, putting the country just below Brazil and the US overall. Over 311,000 Indians have died from covid so far, according to official sources—but the true death toll is believed to be far higher.\nAs in other places, people are struggling to cope with these deaths at a time when traditional ways of grieving have been ripped apart. Natasha Mickles, a professor of religious studies at Texas State University, where she studies Hindu and Buddhist death rituals, says that millennia-old traditions have had to be ignored. “Traditionally, in Hinduism and Jainism, the eldest son is responsible for lighting the funeral pyre,” Mickles says. But covid’s infectiousness and fatality rate mean that the eldest son is often not available or, worse, dead. That means families are having to figure out how to cremate or bury their family member while already overwhelmed with the task of notifying relatives about the death.\n“Death rituals are some of the most conservative parts of culture,” Mickles says. “A lot of them are so ingrained that they require cultural cataclysms to change. We’re seeing that with the pandemic raging. We’re seeing a transformation in how we grieve.”\n\n\n476 #Funerals In One Day In #Kanpur#COVID-19 #victims being #cremated at #Bhairav Ghat Hindu Crematory, as coronavirus cases surge in record numbers across the country, in Kanpur. #SecondCOVIDWave #up78 #CoronaUpdate #CoronavirusIndia #CoronaCurfew #photojournalistarun pic.twitter.com/LBtzsKwcte\n— Arun Sharma (@ARUNSHARMAJI) April 23, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline spaces have offered a crucial forum for expressing grief and venting anger about the Indian government’s handling of the crisis. Families that have faced loss are sharing their pain in WhatsApp groups. In mutual aid organizations that are crowdsourcing help, volunteers can barely process their grief for those who have died as they race to organize help for the next person. Twitter has become a steady stream of obituaries; one grieving woman’s plea to Modi to allow for mercy killings has gone viral.\nBut while smartphones are widespread in India at all socioeconomic levels, digital literacy and the ability to connect online are still linked to wealth and privilege—meaning that only a certain segment of the population is able to grieve online.\n“I haven’t seen anything on this scale of pandemic grief ever,” says Shah Alam Khan, an orthopedic oncologist and professor at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Previously, you saw numbers of people who died from covid. Now, there are names. Each and every one of us knows someone who has been taken away by covid. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t know someone who’s died.”\nIn Khan’s hospital alone, he is seeing doctors so overwhelmed with grief that they are falling apart themselves. Just recently, after an eighth unsuccessful resuscitation attempt, a colleague killed himself in his office. It’s a death that Khan speaks of quietly: he admits he hasn’t wrapped his head around it yet.\n“When death happens in our deeply religious society, grief becomes more a part of tradition than anything else,” he says. “I am atheist, but in this country, death and grieving are easier if you are a spiritual person.”\nSeema Hari has been one of countless people using the Stories feature on Instagram to share resources such as Google Docs with information about where to find oxygen tanks, focusing on her native Mumbai. But as members of her own family have fallen ill with covid, she’s tumbled into grief, isolated save for her Instagram page. \n“I spent most of my days worrying and trying to share resources with people, and nights checking in via WhatsApp—not just with my family but with other friends all over India, asking them the dreaded question of whether everyone on their side is okay and if they need any help,” she said via email.\nHari said she hasn’t felt the ability to grieve properly and doesn’t see herself doing so: “There is so much collective and personal grief to process, but it is almost like we have not even been afforded the privilege to grieve, because loss is so relentless and so many things demand our action and attention.”\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Seema Hari (@seemahari)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNikhil Taneja, the founder of the youth media organization Yuvaa, has helped people connect during the unfolding catastrophe by hosting Twitter Spaces sessions with Neha Kirpal, a mental health professional.\n\n\nWe had an extremely insightful @TwitterSpaces session yesterday on COVID-19 grief and anxiety with @theInnerHour.

The paper reported results of a massive modeling project that Reich has co-led, with his colleague Evan Ray, since the early days of the pandemic. The project began with their attempts to compare various models online making short-term forecasts about covid-19 trajectories, looking one to four weeks ahead, for infection rates, hospitalizations, and deaths. All used varying data sources and methods and produced vastly divergent forecasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I spent a few nights with forecasts on browsers on multiple screens, trying to make a simple comparison,” says Reich (who is also a puzzler and a juggler). “It was impossible.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to standardize an analysis, in April 2020, Reich’s lab, in collaboration with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched the “<a href=\"https://covid19forecasthub.org/\">COVID-19 Forecast Hub</a>.” The hub <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/forecasting/forecasting-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcovid-data%2Fforecasting-us.html\">aggregates</a> and evaluates weekly results from many models and then generates an “ensemble model.” The upshot of the study, Reich says, is that “relying on individual models is not the best approach. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reichlab/status/1359147375953129482\">Combining or synthesizing</a> multiple models will give you the most accurate short-term predictions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><strong>“The sharper you define the target, the less likely you are to hit it.”</strong></p><cite>Sebastian Funk</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of short-term forecasting is to consider how likely different trajectories are in the immediate future. This information is crucial for public health agencies in making decisions and implementing policy, but it’s hard to come by, especially during a pandemic amid ever-evolving uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebastian Funk, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, borrows from the great Swedish physician Hans Rosling, who in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/three-minutes-with-hans-rosling-will-change-your-mind-about-the-world-1.21143?linkId=32632778\">reflecting on his experience</a> helping the Liberian government fight the 2014 Ebola epidemic, observed: “We were losing ourselves in details &#8230; All we needed to know is, are the number of cases rising, falling, or leveling off?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That in itself is not always a trivial task, given that noise in different data streams can obscure true trends,” says Funk, whose team contributes to the US hub, and this past March launched a parallel venture, the <a href=\"https://covid19forecasthub.eu/\">European COVID-19 Forecast Hub</a>, in collaboration the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to hit the bull’s eye</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub has included submissions from about 100 international teams, in academia, industry, and government, as well as independent researchers, such as the data scientist <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/27/1023657/lessons-from-the-pandemics-superstar-data-scientist-youyang-gu/\">Youyang Gu</a>. Most teams try to mirror what’s happening in the world with a standard epidemiological framework. Others use statistical models that crunch numbers looking for trends, or deep learning techniques; some mix-and-match.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Every week, teams each submit not only a point forecast predicting a single number outcome (say, that in one week there will be 500 deaths). They also submit probabilistic predictions that quantify the uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the number of cases or deaths at intervals, or ranges, that get narrower and narrower, targeting a central forecast. For instance, a model might predict that there’s a 90 percent probability of seeing 100 to 500 deaths, a 50 percent probability of seeing 300 to 400, and 10 percent probability of seeing 350 to 360.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s like a bull’s eye, getting more and more focused,” says Reich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funk adds: “The sharper you define the target, the less likely you are to hit it.” It’s fine balance, since an arbitrarily wide forecast will be correct, and also useless. “It should be as precise as possible,” says Funk, “while also giving the correct answer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In collating and evaluating all the individual models, the ensemble tries to optimize their information and mitigate their shortcomings. The result is a probabilistic prediction, statistical average, or a “median forecast.” It’s a consensus, essentially, with a more finely calibrated, and hence more realistic, expression of the uncertainty. All the various elements of uncertainty average out in the wash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study by Reich’s lab, which focused on projected deaths and evaluated about 200,000 forecasts from mid-May to late-December 2020 (an updated analysis with predictions for four more months will soon be added), found that the performance of individual models was highly variable. One week a model might be accurate, the next week it might be way off. But, as the authors wrote, “In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these ensemble exercises serve not only to improve predictions, but also people’s trust in the models, says Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. “One of the lessons of ensemble modeling is that none of the models is perfect,” Tuite says. “And even the ensemble sometimes will miss something important. Models in general have a hard time forecasting inflection points—peaks, or if things suddenly start accelerating or decelerating.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-solid-color\"><blockquote><p><strong>“Models are not oracles.”</strong></p><cite>Alessandro Vespignani</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of ensemble modeling is not unique to the pandemic. In fact, we consume probabilistic ensemble forecasts every day when Googling the weather and taking note that there’s 90 percent chance of precipitation. It’s the gold standard for both weather and climate predictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s been a real success story and the way to go for about three decades,” says Tilmann Gneiting, a computational statistician at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Prior to ensembles, weather forecasting used a single numerical model, which produced, in raw form, a deterministic weather forecast that was “ridiculously overconfident and wildly unreliable,” says Gneiting (weather forecasters, aware of this problem, subjected the raw results to <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/11/8/1520-0450_1972_011_1203_tuomos_2_0_co_2.xml?tab_body=pdf\">subsequent statistical analysis</a> that produced reasonably reliable probability of precipitation forecasts by the 1960s).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gneiting notes, however, that the analogy between infectious disease and weather forecasting has its limitations. For one thing, the probability of precipitation doesn’t change in response to human behavior—it’ll rain, umbrella or no umbrella—whereas the trajectory of the pandemic responds to our preventative measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forecasting during a pandemic is a system subject to a feedback loop. “Models are not oracles,” says Alessandro Vespignani, a computational epidemiologist at Northeastern University and ensemble hub contributor, who studies complex networks and infectious disease spread with a focus on the “techno-social” systems that drive feedback mechanisms. “Any model is providing an answer that is conditional on certain assumptions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people process a model’s prediction, their subsequent behavioral changes upend the assumptions, change the disease dynamics and render the forecast inaccurate. In this way, modeling can be a “self-destroying prophecy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are other factors that could compound the uncertainty: seasonality, variants, vaccine availability or uptake; and policy changes like the swift decision from the CDC about unmasking. “These all amount to huge unknowns that, if you actually wanted to capture the uncertainty of the future, would really limit what you could say,” says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and a contributor to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ensemble study of death forecasts observed that accuracy decays, and uncertainty grows, as models make predictions farther into the future—there was about two times the error looking four weeks ahead versus one week (four weeks is considered the limit for meaningful short-term forecasts; at the 20-week time horizon there was about five times the error).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><strong>“It’s fair to debate when things worked and when things didn’t.”</strong></p><cite>Johannes Bracher</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But assessing the quality of the models—warts and all—is an important secondary goal of forecasting hubs. And it’s easy enough to do, since short-term predictions are quickly confronted with the reality of the numbers tallied day-to-day, as a measure of their success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most researchers are careful to differentiate between this type of “forecast model,” aiming to make explicit and verifiable predictions about the future, which is only possible in the short- term; versus a “scenario model,” exploring “what if” hypotheticals, possible plotlines that might develop in the medium- or long-term future (since scenario models are not meant to be predictions, they shouldn’t be evaluated retrospectively against reality).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic, a critical spotlight has often been directed at models with predictions that were spectacularly wrong. “While longer-term what-if projections are difficult to evaluate, we shouldn’t shy away from comparing short-term predictions with reality,” says Johannes Bracher, a biostatistician at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who coordinates a <a href=\"https://kitmetricslab.github.io/forecasthub/forecast\">German and Polish hub</a>, and advises the European hub. “It’s fair to debate when things worked and when things didn’t,” he says. But an informed debate requires recognizing and considering the limits and intentions of models (sometimes the fiercest critics were those who mistook scenario models for forecast models).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-solid-color\"><blockquote><p><strong>“The big question is, can we improve?”</strong></p><cite>Nicholas Reich</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, when predictions in any given situation prove particularly intractable, modelers should say so. “If we have learned one thing, it’s that cases are extremely difficult to model even in the short run,” says Bracher. “Deaths are a more lagged indicator and are easier to predict.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, some of the European models were overly pessimistic and missed a sudden decrease in cases. A public debate ensued about the accuracy and reliability of pandemic models. Weighing in on Twitter, Bracher asked: “Is it surprising that the models are (not infrequently) wrong? After a 1-year pandemic, I would say: no.” &nbsp;This makes it all the more important, he says, that models indicate their level of certainty or uncertainty, that they take a realistic stance about how unpredictable cases are, and about the future course. “Modelers need to communicate the uncertainty, but it shouldn’t be seen as a failure,” Bracher says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trusting some models more than others</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an oft-quoted statistical aphorism goes, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” But as Bracher notes, “If you do the ensemble model approach, in a sense you are saying that all models are useful, that each model has something to contribute”—though some models may be more informative or reliable than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Observing this fluctuation prompted Reich and others to try “training” the ensemble model—that is, as Reich explains, “building algorithms that teach the ensemble to ‘trust’ some models more than others and learn which precise combination of models works in harmony together.” Bracher’s team now contributes a mini-ensemble, built from only the models that have performed consistently well in the past, amplifying the clearest signal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The big question is, can we improve?” Reich says. “The original method is so simple. It seems like there has to be a way of improving on just taking a simple average of all these models.” So far, however, it is proving harder than expected—small improvements seem feasible, but dramatic improvements may be close to impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A complementary tool for improving our overall perspective on the pandemic beyond week-to-week glimpses is to look further out on the time horizon, four to six months, with those “scenario modeling.” Last December, motivated by the surge in cases and the imminent availability of the vaccine, Lessler and collaborators launched the <a href=\"https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/index.html\">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub</a>, in consultation with the CDC.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Scenario models put bounds on the future based on well-defined “what if” assumptions—zeroing in on what are deemed to be important sources of uncertainty and using them as leverage points in charting the course ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this end, Katriona Shea, a theoretical ecologist at Penn State University and a scenario hub coordinator, brings to the process a formal approach to making good decisions in an uncertain environment—drawing out the researchers via “<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/577\">expert elicitation</a>,” aiming for a diversity of opinions, with a minimum of bias and confusion.

This week, we dissect the Spotify model fallacy. (By the way, Spotify is no longer using product squads.) We also point at the forward-thinking approach of pirates regarding governance and self-management and why some people have difficulties embracing the idea of autonomous action by self-directed individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then learn the two only ways of pushing back requests to build features to close deals. Moreover, we list core principles that come with experimentation and what it takes to drive the change; finally, we analyze the popular leadership fallacy to mandate creating ‘innovative feature,’ probably, with a timeline, incentivized by OKRs. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we delve into the origins of feature creep, adding on top of the usual suspects—such as gold-plating—the difficulties that distributed teams face.

It’s getting inside your interviewer’s mind, and understanding <em>why</em> they’re asking you these questions, and <em>what</em> they want to know.</p><h3>The Most Common Product Management Interview Questions</h3><ol><li><strong>What do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?</strong></li><li><strong>How do you stay user-focused?</strong></li><li><strong>What main changes would you make to [our product]?</strong></li><li><strong>How do you see your career developing in the next 5 years?</strong></li><li><strong>Tell us about a time you used data to influence an important stakeholder.</strong></li><li><strong>Tell us about a time you faced failure and how you bounced back.</strong></li><li><strong>What are your main strengths and weaknesses?</strong></li><li><strong>What’s your approach to prioritizing tasks?</strong></li><li><strong>Why do you want to work at [our company]?</strong></li><li><strong>Why do you want to be/what do you love about being a Product Manager?</strong></li></ol><h3>Behind the Questions…</h3><h3>1. What do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Product Management is not a well-defined role across company lines. Each organization has a slightly different approach to development, and so they have a different view of Product Management and its role.</p><p>On top of that, each individual Product Manager builds their craft in a slightly different way. You might start out doing PM one way at the start of your career, and then have developed a completely different set of frameworks and techniques by the end.</p><p>An interviewer will ask you your approaches to PM, and how you see the role’s place within development, to make sure that you’re on the same wavelength.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>Every interview takes place on the basis that there is a need to be filled within a company, and the interviewee has the potential to fill that need. When you’re asked ‘what do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?’, the interviewer wants to know that you both see that need in the same way.</p><p>They want to know what you see as a PMs main responsibilities, the level of authority they have, and how far the buck stops with the PM in your opinion. If in doubt, quote the old PM adage… “with great responsibility, comes no power.”</p><h3>2. How do you stay user-focused?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Most companies, especially product-led companies, pride themselves on being customer-obsessed. As a Product Manager, you’re expected to be the voice of the customer, and to hold the most customer knowledge. No pressure, but how user-focused development is sort of depends on how user-focused <em>you</em> are.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>The most important thing they want to know is that you <em>are</em> user-focused, so you need to make that absolutely clear, without a shadow of a doubt. You can talk about methods you’ve used in the past, and how you’ve revisited user feedback throughout development to make important iterations.</p><p>If you’ve ever had to say ‘no’ to stakeholders in order to be a better advocate for your users, this is the time to make that known. Think about times you’ve had to make tough choices in order to build a better product for your users, or talk about the methods you’ve used (they could be <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/agile-product-management-study-guide/\"><strong>agile user-first frameworks</strong></a> like story mapping) or how you embed the voice of the customer into development.</p><h3>3.What main changes would you make to [our product]?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking</strong>: Pointing out flaws in someone else’s work (especially when you’re trying hard to impress them) isn’t the most comfortable conversation to have. This is a mini-test on how you deliver feedback, whilst also testing your awareness of the product.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>This (usually) isn’t a trick question. They really want to know how you would improve their product. Try to use your PM thinking skills to unpack this question. While you don’t have access to the data to back up your suggestions, you should be in a position to come up with a hypothesis.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/get-product-management-job-spotify/\"><strong>if you’re interviewing at Spotify</strong></a>, you might suggest adding a chat feature in order to easily share songs between friends, because you have personal experience of having to send links to friends via WhatsApp, which doesn’t make for the smoothest experience. Talk about how you’d find out if others had the same problem, and how you’d approach solving the problem in a user-focused way.</p><h3>4.How do you see your career developing in the next 5 years?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking: </strong>Most companies won’t want to invest the time in hiring and helping to shape a Product Manager, only to have them leave because their growth trajectory is not currently the same as what’s on offer. They want to know that you’ll be able to grow <em>with</em> them. There are a few different paths that a PM can take as they progress. They could go more into people-management and lead a team of Product Managers, or they could go more technical.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>They want to know that your career goals are a match for their company. If your goal is to get a couple of years experience with them before moving over to a different industry…that’s probably information that’s best kept to yourself if you want to get hired! Saying that, try to be as honest as possible. If there’s no room to grow within a company, and you’re ambitious with your career goals, you might be better off somewhere else.</p><p>Product Management is a fast growing career, and if you’re interviewing for a big company, they’ll want people who are hungry for that growth and who will work towards making a bigger impact and having more responsibilities.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*wE2UJ0_S8tUgXfag\" /></figure><h3>5. Tell us about a time you used data to influence an important stakeholder.</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Really, this question could have been about any situation a Product Manager is likely to face. They could just as easily ask about how you used data to validate a new idea, or how you managed the change from office-based to <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/jobs-cat/remote-product-manager/\"><strong>remote working</strong></a>. They’re asking because they need to know how you handle yourself in the day-to-day situations that PMs find themselves in. It’s a way of making sure that you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk.</p><p>It’s also about gauging the kind of experiences you’ve had in the past, and whether you’re able to solve problems, resolve conflicts, and lead their teams.</p><p><strong>What they want to know:</strong> They don’t need to know all of the details (they don’t have time to hear your life story), they want to know whether or not you’ve faced typical PM challenges and that you are adept at overcoming them. If they ask you about a situation you’ve never faced before, you can do one of two things. You can say “that’s not something that’s happened to me specifically, but in a similar vein…” and go on to talk about the next closest situation. Or if you’re <a href=\"https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/transition-product-management-background/\"><strong>transitioning to PM from another discipline</strong></a>, and have yet to face any real PM situations, you can talk about how you would hypothetically face that situation.</p><p>It’s mostly a thought exercise, so don’t worry about not having the right experience. Most product leaders will tell you that it’s more important to hire someone with the right instincts than to hire someone who’s been through a situation before.</p><h3>6. Tell us about a time you faced failure and how you bounced back.</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Everybody fails now and again, and more and more we’re learning that failure is nothing to be ashamed of. Any tech leader will tell you that failure is an essential hurdle on the road to success. Self-awareness is a very important trait for Product Managers, and so is being able to learn from failure. They’re asking you about your failures to see how self-aware you are, and to also understand how you process and learn from failures.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>They want to know how you respond to negative experiences, but it’s important to select an experience that ended positively for you. Put yourself in the shoes of an interviewer and look at these two answers:</p><ol><li>“In my previous role, I was told off by my manager for always being on my phone and taking personal calls. She gave me a disciplinary warning, because I didn’t realize that the company had such a strict policy on taking personal calls at work. So I learned to save my phone-time for my lunch breaks.”</li><li>“Last summer, I launched a side-project that didn’t take off the way I expected it to. It turns out that it’s going to take more resources to properly promote and market than I expected. So I’ve learned that resource-planning ahead of launch is incredibly important. I’ve put my project on the back burner for now to give me more time to strategize and up my marketing skills.”</li></ol><p>Which person would you hire? Person 1 was objectively doing something wrong. Person 2 was trying something new with the best intentions, that ended up not working. Both learned from their mistakes, but Person 2 was learning from a commonplace and justifiable mistake.</p><p>So choose your scenario carefully!</p><h3>7. What are your main strengths and weaknesses?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> This is another question that’s all about self-awareness. Recognising areas you need to improve on, or gaps in your skill set is the first step to growth and development. It’s also important for them to know if there are any areas you’re particularly weak in. For example, if they have an AI product and you don’t have strong AI skills, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but they’ll want to factor in the extra training you’ll need.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>They want to know that you’re genuinely aware of your weaknesses. None of this “I’m just <em>too </em>obsessed with work.” They want your real and raw flaws.</p><p>Think about a genuine weakness of yours, and tell them how it affects you/your work, but back it up with a plan on how you’re working on it. For example, if you find yourself trying and failing to multitask effectively, you might tell them that you’ve started implementing <a href=\"https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\"><strong>the pomodoro technique</strong></a>.</p><p>But the other part of the question is just as important. They also want to know what your strengths are. Think about the things you pride yourself on, and try to tactically identify what would be most valuable to the role.</p><h3>8. What’s your approach to prioritizing tasks?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking: </strong>Prioritization is the name of the game in Product Management, so you can probably expect this question to come up at some point in the interview process.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>You might be tempted to throw around the names of some popular prioritization techniques, and that’s fine. But it’s probably more important to talk about the soft skills around prioritization. How to say no, how to make sure you’ve listened to all of the right opinions and asked the right questions, and how to get everyone aligned on your prioritization decisions.</p><h3>9. Why do you want to work at [our company]?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking:</strong> Bigger companies know that their name carries a certain amount of clout. So if you’re interviewing at the Googles and Apples of the world, they want to know that you <em>really</em> want to work at Google or Apple, not just that you want to say you do.</p><p>Even for smaller companies, they want to know that they’re hiring people who have the same goals and values that they do. There’s no shame in applying for jobs because you need the bills to be paid, but it’s in a company’s interest to find the people who are going to be passionate about the work they’re doing.</p><p><strong>What they want to know: </strong>Here they’ll be looking to learn more about your goals and values, as well as what your understanding of the company’s mission is. A great position to be in, is to be able to see the future potential of a company or product, and to be able to express your eagerness to help fulfil it.</p><p>Think about where the company is going, and talk about how you’d love to fit into it.</p><h3>10. Why do you want to be/what do you love about being a Product Manager?</h3><p><strong>Why they’re asking</strong>: Product Management isn’t just about getting through your days work, and letting the days add up until eventually you have a product. Product Management is about hunger, and drive, and passion. You’ve got to wake up every morning excited to be doing what you’re doing, otherwise how are you going to motivate your team to feel the same?</p><p><strong>What they want to know:</strong> You should have this question answered already. And no blog, no matter how great (if we do say so ourselves) can answer it for you. Be honest, and talk about what got you started on this journey and why you’re excited to be in Product Management.</p><p>The hard part won’t be picking one. It’ll be picking <em>only</em> one.</p><h3>Summary: What Do Interviewers Want to Know?</h3><p>No matter which questions you get asked in a Product Management interview, the two best strategies for acing it is to be honest whilst thinking about what’s going on in an interviewer’s head. Cut through all of the things you <em>could</em> talk about, spend your precious time talking about the things they really need to know.</p><p>It’s very easy to say a lot without saying anything — everyone who’s ever sat through a useless team meeting will tell you that! Getting into an interviewer’s head isn’t about telling them what they want to hear, it’s about making the most of your time with them and making each second count. You want them to walk away from your interview full of reasons to hire you.</p><p>Want to learn more about acing the Product Management interview?

When you’re asked ‘what do you see as a Product Manager’s main role within product development?’, the interviewer wants to know that you both see that need in the same way.\nThey want to know what you see as a PMs main responsibilities, the level of authority they have, and how far the buck stops with the PM in your opinion. If in doubt, quote the old PM adage… “with great responsibility, comes no power.”\n2. How do you stay user-focused?\nWhy they’re asking: Most companies, especially product-led companies, pride themselves on being customer-obsessed. As a Product Manager, you’re expected to be the voice of the customer, and to hold the most customer knowledge. No pressure, but how user-focused development is sort of depends on how user-focused you are.\nWhat they want to know: The most important thing they want to know is that you are user-focused, so you need to make that absolutely clear, without a shadow of a doubt. You can talk about methods you’ve used in the past, and how you’ve revisited user feedback throughout development to make important iterations.\nIf you’ve ever had to say ‘no’ to stakeholders in order to be a better advocate for your users, this is the time to make that known. Think about times you’ve had to make tough choices in order to build a better product for your users, or talk about the methods you’ve used (they could be agile user-first frameworks like story mapping) or how you embed the voice of the customer into development.\n3.What main changes would you make to [our product]?\nWhy they’re asking: Pointing out flaws in someone else’s work (especially when you’re trying hard to impress them) isn’t the most comfortable conversation to have. This is a mini-test on how you deliver feedback, whilst also testing your awareness of the product.\nWhat they want to know: This (usually) isn’t a trick question. They really want to know how you would improve their product. Try to use your PM thinking skills to unpack this question. While you don’t have access to the data to back up your suggestions, you should be in a position to come up with a hypothesis.\nFor example, if you’re interviewing at Spotify, you might suggest adding a chat feature in order to easily share songs between friends, because you have personal experience of having to send links to friends via WhatsApp, which doesn’t make for the smoothest experience. Talk about how you’d find out if others had the same problem, and how you’d approach solving the problem in a user-focused way.\n4.How do you see your career developing in the next 5 years?\nWhy they’re asking: Most companies won’t want to invest the time in hiring and helping to shape a Product Manager, only to have them leave because their growth trajectory is not currently the same as what’s on offer. They want to know that you’ll be able to grow with them. There are a few different paths that a PM can take as they progress. They could go more into people-management and lead a team of Product Managers, or they could go more technical.\nWhat they want to know: They want to know that your career goals are a match for their company. If your goal is to get a couple of years experience with them before moving over to a different industry…that’s probably information that’s best kept to yourself if you want to get hired! Saying that, try to be as honest as possible. If there’s no room to grow within a company, and you’re ambitious with your career goals, you might be better off somewhere else.\nProduct Management is a fast growing career, and if you’re interviewing for a big company, they’ll want people who are hungry for that growth and who will work towards making a bigger impact and having more responsibilities.\n\n5. Tell us about a time you used data to influence an important stakeholder.\nWhy they’re asking: Really, this question could have been about any situation a Product Manager is likely to face. They could just as easily ask about how you used data to validate a new idea, or how you managed the change from office-based to remote working. They’re asking because they need to know how you handle yourself in the day-to-day situations that PMs find themselves in. It’s a way of making sure that you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk.\nIt’s also about gauging the kind of experiences you’ve had in the past, and whether you’re able to solve problems, resolve conflicts, and lead their teams.\nWhat they want to know: They don’t need to know all of the details (they don’t have time to hear your life story), they want to know whether or not you’ve faced typical PM challenges and that you are adept at overcoming them. If they ask you about a situation you’ve never faced before, you can do one of two things. You can say “that’s not something that’s happened to me specifically, but in a similar vein…” and go on to talk about the next closest situation. Or if you’re transitioning to PM from another discipline, and have yet to face any real PM situations, you can talk about how you would hypothetically face that situation.\nIt’s mostly a thought exercise, so don’t worry about not having the right experience. Most product leaders will tell you that it’s more important to hire someone with the right instincts than to hire someone who’s been through a situation before.\n6. Tell us about a time you faced failure and how you bounced back.\nWhy they’re asking: Everybody fails now and again, and more and more we’re learning that failure is nothing to be ashamed of. Any tech leader will tell you that failure is an essential hurdle on the road to success. Self-awareness is a very important trait for Product Managers, and so is being able to learn from failure. They’re asking you about your failures to see how self-aware you are, and to also understand how you process and learn from failures.\nWhat they want to know: They want to know how you respond to negative experiences, but it’s important to select an experience that ended positively for you. Put yourself in the shoes of an interviewer and look at these two answers:\n\n“In my previous role, I was told off by my manager for always being on my phone and taking personal calls. She gave me a disciplinary warning, because I didn’t realize that the company had such a strict policy on taking personal calls at work. So I learned to save my phone-time for my lunch breaks.”\n“Last summer, I launched a side-project that didn’t take off the way I expected it to. It turns out that it’s going to take more resources to properly promote and market than I expected. So I’ve learned that resource-planning ahead of launch is incredibly important. I’ve put my project on the back burner for now to give me more time to strategize and up my marketing skills.”\n\nWhich person would you hire? Person 1 was objectively doing something wrong. Person 2 was trying something new with the best intentions, that ended up not working. Both learned from their mistakes, but Person 2 was learning from a commonplace and justifiable mistake.\nSo choose your scenario carefully!\n7. What are your main strengths and weaknesses?\nWhy they’re asking: This is another question that’s all about self-awareness. Recognising areas you need to improve on, or gaps in your skill set is the first step to growth and development. It’s also important for them to know if there are any areas you’re particularly weak in. For example, if they have an AI product and you don’t have strong AI skills, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but they’ll want to factor in the extra training you’ll need.\nWhat they want to know: They want to know that you’re genuinely aware of your weaknesses. None of this “I’m just too obsessed with work.” They want your real and raw flaws.\nThink about a genuine weakness of yours, and tell them how it affects you/your work, but back it up with a plan on how you’re working on it. For example, if you find yourself trying and failing to multitask effectively, you might tell them that you’ve started implementing the pomodoro technique.\nBut the other part of the question is just as important. They also want to know what your strengths are. Think about the things you pride yourself on, and try to tactically identify what would be most valuable to the role.\n8. What’s your approach to prioritizing tasks?\nWhy they’re asking: Prioritization is the name of the game in Product Management, so you can probably expect this question to come up at some point in the interview process.\nWhat they want to know: You might be tempted to throw around the names of some popular prioritization techniques, and that’s fine. But it’s probably more important to talk about the soft skills around prioritization. How to say no, how to make sure you’ve listened to all of the right opinions and asked the right questions, and how to get everyone aligned on your prioritization decisions.\n9. Why do you want to work at [our company]?\nWhy they’re asking: Bigger companies know that their name carries a certain amount of clout. So if you’re interviewing at the Googles and Apples of the world, they want to know that you really want to work at Google or Apple, not just that you want to say you do.\nEven for smaller companies, they want to know that they’re hiring people who have the same goals and values that they do. There’s no shame in applying for jobs because you need the bills to be paid, but it’s in a company’s interest to find the people who are going to be passionate about the work they’re doing.\nWhat they want to know: Here they’ll be looking to learn more about your goals and values, as well as what your understanding of the company’s mission is. A great position to be in, is to be able to see the future potential of a company or product, and to be able to express your eagerness to help fulfil it.\nThink about where the company is going, and talk about how you’d love to fit into it.\n10. Why do you want to be/what do you love about being a Product Manager?\nWhy they’re asking: Product Management isn’t just about getting through your days work, and letting the days add up until eventually you have a product. Product Management is about hunger, and drive, and passion. You’ve got to wake up every morning excited to be doing what you’re doing, otherwise how are you going to motivate your team to feel the same?\nWhat they want to know: You should have this question answered already. And no blog, no matter how great (if we do say so ourselves) can answer it for you. Be honest, and talk about what got you started on this journey and why you’re excited to be in Product Management.\nThe hard part won’t be picking one. It’ll be picking only one.\nSummary: What Do Interviewers Want to Know?\nNo matter which questions you get asked in a Product Management interview, the two best strategies for acing it is to be honest whilst thinking about what’s going on in an interviewer’s head. Cut through all of the things you could talk about, spend your precious time talking about the things they really need to know.\nIt’s very easy to say a lot without saying anything — everyone who’s ever sat through a useless team meeting will tell you that! Getting into an interviewer’s head isn’t about telling them what they want to hear, it’s about making the most of your time with them and making each second count. You want them to walk away from your interview full of reasons to hire you.\nWant to learn more about acing the Product Management interview?

Although both are essential, not all firms have the funds to do both or the skill sets to develop capabilities in data management or analysis algorithms, or the partner ecosystem to leverage, collaborate, co-create, and share risk. Furthermore, these firms may not have experience in setting up governance and compliance structures to use clinical data in compliance with regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specific internal capabilities, as well as planning and resources are required to develop and maintain a digital ecosystem to realize the multiple benefits of data, analytics, and collaboration with appropriate partners.

It allows users to access, develop, and run applications, and unify digital transformation using a single platform, reducing the use of resources needed to drive transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Data is in silos, and to optimize clinical pathways, all stakeholders need to work together by co-creating and co-opeting,” says Max Milz, senior partner and senior vice president at Siemens Advanta Consulting. “In other words, data needs to be accessed, processed, stored, analyzed, and shared in a secure and compliant manner for it to be useful to different stakeholders. PaaS is one of the enablers for driving this integration. Medical technology companies can accelerate their digital transformation efforts by leveraging first-mile connectivity to a hospital ecosystem and last-mile access to data offered by the teamplay digital health platform.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Medical technology needs a specific platform</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most health-care data management use cases are industry-specific with requirements to access imaging, pathology, and clinical data. Stakeholders considering a platform would benefit from collaborating with one that has domain specificity and is incubated and managed by another experienced medical technology organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A platform specific to medical technology offers vertical domain expertise from a market access and connectivity perspective, access to relevant data, specific applications for that sector, and experience of the security and regulatory compliance requirements, allowing partners to focus on the development of their core solutions and value propositions. Using a medical technology PaaS offers medical equipment and device companies the flexibility to adapt continuously to evolving market needs, optimizing investment in time and resources while being guided by a valued partner with experience of developing a platform fit for purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a competitive market, medical technology companies must focus on accelerated product development while partnering with the best PaaS provider to help realize their overall digital transformation goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The majority of medical technology companies have a strong product presence,” explains Thomas Friese, senior vice president for digital platforms at Siemens Healthineers. “However, what they also need is to transform to a sustainable service model.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s no need to go it alone. “Co-opetition is gathering prominence in medical technology and pharma, and all stakeholders stand to only benefit from integration. PaaS will become very relevant in this context, thus positioning teamplay digital health platform uniquely, with its domain-specific expertise and digital transformation capabilities,” Friese says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A</strong><strong> proven and compliant PaaS platform: teamplay</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A company with extensive experience in imaging and diagnostics can build a platform that brings together a strong diagnostic and therapeutic core and specialized digital offerings, and systematically expand it across multiple functionalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several use cases can be used as templates for technology advancement, enabling partners to achieve their objectives. teamplay acts as a technology accelerator for medical technology companies, providing first-mile connectivity and last-mile access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a medical technology-specific platform provider, Siemens Healthineers offers vertical domain expertise and industry expertise, differentiating it from horizontal platform capabilities offered by leading IT companies.

POET generates the obstacle courses, assesses the bots’ abilities, and assigns their next challenge, all without human involvement. Step by faltering step, the bots improve&nbsp;via trial and error. “At some point it might jump over a cliff like a kung fu master,” says Wang.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may seem basic at the moment, but for Wang and a handful of other researchers, POET hints at a revolutionary new way to create supersmart machines: by getting AI to make itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wang’s former colleague Jeff Clune is among the biggest boosters of this idea. Clune has been working on it for years, first at the University of Wyoming and then at Uber AI Labs, where he worked with Wang and others. Now dividing his time between the University of British Columbia and OpenAI, he has the backing of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/\">one of the world’s top artificial-intelligence labs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune calls the attempt to build truly intelligent AI the most ambitious scientific quest in human history. Today, seven decades after serious efforts to make AI began, we’re still a long way from creating machines that are anywhere near as smart as humans, let alone smarter. Clune thinks POET might point to a shortcut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We need to take the shackles off and get out of our own way,” he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Clune is right, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10985.pdf\">using AI to make AI</a> could be an important step on the road that one day leads to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/15/1010461/artificial-general-intelligence-robots-ai-agi-deepmind-google-openai/\">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI)—machines that can outthink humans. In the nearer term, the technique might also help us discover different kinds of intelligence: non-human smarts that can find solutions in unexpected ways and perhaps complement our own intelligence rather than replace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mimicking evolution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I first spoke to Clune about the idea early last year, just a few weeks after his move to OpenAI. He was happy to discuss past work but remained tight-lipped on what he was doing with his new team. Instead of taking the call inside, he preferred to walk up and down the streets outside the offices as we talked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Clune would say was that OpenAI was a good fit. “My idea is very much in line with many of the things that they believe,” he says. “It was kind of a marriage made in heaven. They liked the vision and wanted me to come here and pursue it.” A few months after Clune joined, OpenAI hired most of his old Uber team as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune’s ambitious vision is grounded by more than OpenAI’s investment. The history of AI is filled with examples in which human-designed solutions gave way to machine-learned ones. Take computer vision: a decade ago, the big breakthrough in image recognition came when existing hand-crafted systems were replaced by ones that taught themselves from scratch. It’s the same for many AI successes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the fascinating things about AI, and machine learning in particular, is its ability to find <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/12/08/147199/alpha-zeros-alien-chess-shows-the-power-and-the-peculiarity-of-ai/\">solutions that humans haven’t found</a>—to surprise us. An oft-cited example is AlphaGo (and its successor AlphaZero), which beat the best humanity has to offer at the ancient, beguiling game of Go by employing seemingly alien strategies. After hundreds of years of study by human masters, AI found solutions no one had ever thought of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune is now working with a team at OpenAI that developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/17/75427/open-ai-algorithms-learned-tool-use-and-cooperation-after-hide-and-seek-games/\">bots that learned to play hide and seek</a>&nbsp;in a virtual environment in 2018. These AIs started off with simple goals and simple tools to achieve them: one pair had to find the other, which could hide behind movable obstacles. Yet when these bots were let loose to learn, they soon found ways to take advantage of their environment in ways the researchers had not foreseen. They exploited glitches in the simulated physics of their virtual world to jump over and even pass through walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those kinds of unexpected emergent behaviors offer tantalizing hints that AI might arrive at technical solutions humans would not think of by themselves,&nbsp;inventing new and more efficient types of algorithms or neural networks—or even ditching neural networks, a cornerstone of modern AI, entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clune likes to remind people that intelligence has already emerged from simple beginnings. “What’s interesting about this approach is that we know it can work,” he says. “The very simple algorithm of Darwinian evolution produced your brain, and your brain is the most intelligent learning algorithm in the universe that we know so far.” His point is that if intelligence as we know it resulted from the mindless mutation of genes over countless generations, why not seek to replicate the intelligence-producing process—which is arguably simpler—rather than intelligence itself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s another crucial observation here. Intelligence was never an endpoint for evolution, something to aim for. Instead, it emerged in many different forms from countless tiny solutions to challenges that allowed living things to survive and take on future challenges. Intelligence is the current high point in an ongoing and open-ended process. In this sense, evolution is quite different from algorithms the way people typically think of them—as means to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s this open-endedness, glimpsed in the apparently aimless sequence of challenges generated by POET, that Clune and others believe could lead to new kinds of AI. For decades AI researchers have tried to build algorithms to mimic human intelligence, but the real breakthrough may come from building algorithms that try to mimic the open-ended problem-solving of evolution—and sitting back to watch what emerges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers are already using machine learning on itself, training it to find solutions to some of the field’s hardest problems, such as how to make machines that can learn more than one task at a time or cope with situations they have not encountered before. Some now think that taking this approach and running with it might be the best path to artificial general intelligence.&nbsp;“We could start an algorithm that initially does not have much intelligence inside it, and watch it bootstrap itself all the way up potentially to AGI,” Clune says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that for now, AGI remains a fantasy. But that’s largely because nobody knows how to make&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Advances in AI are piecemeal and carried out by humans, with progress typically involving tweaks to existing techniques or algorithms, yielding incremental leaps in performance or accuracy. Clune characterizes these efforts as attempts to discover the building blocks for artificial intelligence without knowing what you’re looking for or how many blocks you’ll need. And that’s just the start. “At some point, we have to take on the Herculean task of putting them all together,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking AI to find and&nbsp;assemble those building blocks for us&nbsp;is a paradigm shift. It’s saying we want to create an intelligent machine, but we don’t care what it might look like—just give us whatever works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if AGI is never achieved, the self-teaching approach may still change what sorts of AI are created. The world needs&nbsp;more than a very good Go player, says Clune. For him, creating a supersmart machine means building a system that invents its own challenges, solves them, and then invents new ones. POET is a tiny glimpse of this in action. Clune imagines a machine that teaches a bot to walk, then to play hopscotch, then maybe to play Go. “Then maybe it learns math puzzles and starts inventing its own challenges,” he says. “The system continuously innovates, and the sky’s the limit in terms of where it might go.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s wild speculation, perhaps, but one hope is that machines like this might be able to evade our conceptual dead ends, helping us unpick vastly complex crises such as climate change or global health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first we have to make one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to create a brain</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different ways to wire up an artificial brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neural networks are made from multiple layers of artificial neurons encoded in software. Each neuron can be connected to others in the layers above. The way a neural network is wired makes a big difference, and new architectures often lead to new breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The neural networks coded by human scientists are often the result of trial and error. There is little theory to what does and doesn’t work, and no guarantee that the best designs have been found. That’s why automating the hunt for better neural-network designs has been one of the hottest topics in AI since at least the 1980s. The most common way to automate the process is to let an AI generate many possible network designs, and let the network automatically try each of them and choose the best ones. This is commonly known as neuro-evolution or neural architecture search (NAS).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, these machine designs have started to outstrip human ones. In 2018, Esteban Real and his colleagues at Google used NAS to generate a neural network for image recognition that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01548.pdf\">beat the best human-designed networks</a> at the time. That was an eye-opener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2018 system is part of an ongoing Google project called AutoML, which has also used NAS to produce EfficientNets, a family of deep-learning models that are<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">more efficient than human-designed ones</a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">, achieving high levels of accuracy on image-recognition tasks with smaller, faster models.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years on, Real is pushing the boundaries of what can be generated from scratch. The earlier systems just rearranged tried and tested neural-network pieces, such as existing types of layers or components. “We could expect a good answer,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year Real and his team took the training wheels off. The new system, called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03384\">AutoML Zero</a>, tries to build an AI from the ground up using nothing but the most basic mathematical concepts that govern machine learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazingly, not only did AutoML Zero spontaneously build a neural network, but it came up with gradient descent, the most common mathematical technique that human designers use to train a network. “I was quite surprised,” says Real. “It’s a very simple algorithm—it takes like six lines of code—but it wrote the exact six lines.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AutoML Zero is not yet generating architectures that rival the performance of human-designed systems—or indeed doing much that a human designer would not have done. But Real believes it could one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Time to train a new kind of teacher</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First you make a brain; then you have to teach it. But machine brains don’t learn the way ours do. Our brains are fantastic at adapting to new environments and new tasks. Today’s AIs can solve challenges under certain conditions but fail when those conditions change even a little. This inflexibility is hampering the quest to create more generalizable AI that can be useful across a wide range of scenarios, which would be a big step toward making them truly intelligent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Jane Wang, a researcher at DeepMind in London, the best way to make AI more flexible is to get it to learn that trait itself. In other words, she wants to build an AI that not only learns specific tasks but learns to learn those tasks in ways that can be adapted to fresh situations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers have been trying to make AI more adaptable for years. Wang thinks that getting AI to work through this problem for itself avoids some of the trial and error of a hand-designed approach: “We can’t possibly expect to stumble upon the right answer right away.” In the process, she hopes, we will also learn more about how brains work. “There’s still so much we don’t understand about the way that humans and animals learn,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main approaches to generating learning algorithms automatically, but both start with an existing neural network and use AI to teach it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first approach, invented separately by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05763\">Wang and her colleagues at DeepMind</a>&nbsp;and by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02779.pdf\">a team at OpenAI</a>&nbsp;at around the same time, uses recurrent neural networks. This type of network can be trained in such a way that the activations of their neurons—roughly akin to the firing of neurons in biological brains—encode any type of algorithm. DeepMind and OpenAI took advantage of this to train a recurrent neural network to generate reinforcement-learning algorithms, which tell an AI how to behave to achieve given goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upshot is that the DeepMind and OpenAI systems do not learn an algorithm that solve a specific challenge, such as recognizing images, but learn a&nbsp;<em>learning&nbsp;</em>algorithm that can be applied to multiple tasks and adapt as it goes. It’s like the old adage about teaching someone to fish: whereas a hand-designed algorithm can learn a particular task, these AIs are being made to learn how to learn by themselves. And some of them are performing better than human-designed ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second approach comes from Chelsea Finn at the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues. Called <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/07/18/learning-to-learn/\">model-agnostic meta-learning</a>, or MAML, it trains a model using two machine-learning processes, one nested inside the other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roughly, here’s how it works. The inner process in MAML is trained on data and then tested—as usual. But then the outer model takes the performance of the inner model—how well it identifies images, say—and uses it to learn how to adjust that model’s learning algorithm to boost performance. It’s as if you had an school inspector watching over a bunch of teachers, each offering different learning techniques. The inspector checks which techniques help the students get the best scores and tweaks them accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these approaches, researchers are building AI that is more robust, more generalized, and able to learn faster with less data. For example, Finn wants a robot that has learned to walk on flat ground to be able to transition, with minimal extra training, to walking on a slope or on grass or while carrying a load.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Clune and his colleagues extended Finn’s technique to design an algorithm that learns using fewer neurons so that it does not overwrite everything it has learned previously, a big unsolved problem in machine learning known as catastrophic forgetting. A trained model that uses fewer neurons, known as a “sparse” model, will have more unused neurons left over to dedicate to new tasks when retrained, which means that fewer of the “used” neurons will get overwritten. Clune found that setting his AI the challenge of learning more than one task led it to come up with its own version of a sparse model that outperformed human-designed ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we’re going all in on letting AI create and teach itself, then AIs should generate their own training environments, too—the schools and textbooks, as well as the lesson plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the past year has seen a raft of projects in which AI has been trained on automatically generated data. Face-recognition systems are being trained with AI-generated faces, for example. AIs are also learning how to train each other. In one recent example, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/22/1016633/robot-arms-smarter-self-play-reinforcement-learning-training-openai/\">two robot arms</a> worked together, with one arm learning to set tougher and tougher block-stacking challenges that trained the other to grip and grasp objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Clune wonders if human intuition about what kind of data an AI needs in order to learn may be off. For example, he and his colleagues have developed what he calls <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07768.pdf\">generative teaching networks</a>, which learn what data they should generate to get the best results when training a model. In one experiment, he used one of these networks to adapt a data set of handwritten numbers that’s often used to train image-recognition algorithms. What it came up with looked very different from the original human-curated data set: hundreds of not-quite digits, such as the top half of the figure seven or what looked like two digits merged together. Some AI-generated examples were hard to decipher at all. Despite this, the AI-generated data still did a great job at training the handwriting recognition system to identify actual digits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Don’t try to succeed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-generated data is still just a part of the puzzle. The long-term vision is to take all these techniques—and others not yet invented—and hand them over to an AI trainer that controls how artificial brains are wired, how they are trained, and what they are trained on. Even Clune is not clear on what such a future system would look like. Sometimes he talks about a kind of hyper-realistic simulated sandbox, where AIs can cut their teeth and skin their virtual knees. Something that complex is still years away. The closest thing yet is POET, the system Clune created with Uber’s Rui Wang and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET was motivated by a paradox, says Wang. If you try to solve a problem you’ll fail; if you don’t try to solve it you’re more likely to succeed. This is one of the insights Clune takes from his analogy with evolution—amazing results that emerge from an apparently random process often cannot be re-created by taking deliberate steps toward the same end. There’s no doubt that butterflies exist, but rewind to their single-celled precursors and try to create them from scratch by choosing each step from bacterium to bug, and you’d likely fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET starts its two-legged agent off in a simple environment, such as a flat path without obstacles. At first the agent doesn’t know what to do with its legs and cannot walk. But through trial and error, the reinforcement-learning algorithm controlling it learns how to move along flat ground. POET then generates a new random environment that’s different, but not necessarily harder to move in. The agent tries walking there. If there are obstacles in this new environment, the agent learns how to get over or across those. Every time an agent succeeds or gets stuck, it is moved to a new environment. Over time, the agents learn a range of walking and jumping actions that let them navigate harder and harder obstacle courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team found that random switching of environments was essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, agents sometimes learned to walk on flat ground with a weird, half-kneeling shuffle, because that was good enough. “They never learn to stand up because they never need to,” says Wang. But after they had been forced to learn alternative strategies on obstacle-strewn ground, they could return to the early stage with a better way of walking—using both legs instead of dragging one behind, say—and then take that improved version of itself forward to harder challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>POET trains its bots in a way that no human would—it takes erratic, unintuitive paths to success.

It moves in a half crouch, dragging one knee along the ground. It’s walking! Er, sort of. \nYet Rui Wang is delighted. “Every day I walk into my office and open my computer, and I don’t know what to expect,” he says. \nAn artificial-intelligence researcher at Uber, Wang likes to leave the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer, a piece of software he helped develop, running on his laptop overnight. POET is a kind of training dojo for virtual bots. So far, they aren’t learning to do much at all. These AI agents are not playing Go, spotting signs of cancer, or folding proteins—they’re trying to navigate a crude cartoon landscape of fences and ravines without falling over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it’s not what the bots are learning that’s exciting—it’s how they’re learning. POET generates the obstacle courses, assesses the bots’ abilities, and assigns their next challenge, all without human involvement. Step by faltering step, the bots improve via trial and error. “At some point it might jump over a cliff like a kung fu master,” says Wang. \nIt may seem basic at the moment, but for Wang and a handful of other researchers, POET hints at a revolutionary new way to create supersmart machines: by getting AI to make itself. \nWang’s former colleague Jeff Clune is among the biggest boosters of this idea. Clune has been working on it for years, first at the University of Wyoming and then at Uber AI Labs, where he worked with Wang and others. Now dividing his time between the University of British Columbia and OpenAI, he has the backing of one of the world’s top artificial-intelligence labs.\nClune calls the attempt to build truly intelligent AI the most ambitious scientific quest in human history. Today, seven decades after serious efforts to make AI began, we’re still a long way from creating machines that are anywhere near as smart as humans, let alone smarter. Clune thinks POET might point to a shortcut. \n“We need to take the shackles off and get out of our own way,” he says. \nIf Clune is right, using AI to make AI could be an important step on the road that one day leads to artificial general intelligence (AGI)—machines that can outthink humans. In the nearer term, the technique might also help us discover different kinds of intelligence: non-human smarts that can find solutions in unexpected ways and perhaps complement our own intelligence rather than replace it.\nMimicking evolution\nI first spoke to Clune about the idea early last year, just a few weeks after his move to OpenAI. He was happy to discuss past work but remained tight-lipped on what he was doing with his new team. Instead of taking the call inside, he preferred to walk up and down the streets outside the offices as we talked.\nAll Clune would say was that OpenAI was a good fit. “My idea is very much in line with many of the things that they believe,” he says. “It was kind of a marriage made in heaven. They liked the vision and wanted me to come here and pursue it.” A few months after Clune joined, OpenAI hired most of his old Uber team as well.\nClune’s ambitious vision is grounded by more than OpenAI’s investment. The history of AI is filled with examples in which human-designed solutions gave way to machine-learned ones. Take computer vision: a decade ago, the big breakthrough in image recognition came when existing hand-crafted systems were replaced by ones that taught themselves from scratch. It’s the same for many AI successes. \nOne of the fascinating things about AI, and machine learning in particular, is its ability to find solutions that humans haven’t found—to surprise us. An oft-cited example is AlphaGo (and its successor AlphaZero), which beat the best humanity has to offer at the ancient, beguiling game of Go by employing seemingly alien strategies. After hundreds of years of study by human masters, AI found solutions no one had ever thought of. \nClune is now working with a team at OpenAI that developed bots that learned to play hide and seek in a virtual environment in 2018. These AIs started off with simple goals and simple tools to achieve them: one pair had to find the other, which could hide behind movable obstacles. Yet when these bots were let loose to learn, they soon found ways to take advantage of their environment in ways the researchers had not foreseen. They exploited glitches in the simulated physics of their virtual world to jump over and even pass through walls.\nThose kinds of unexpected emergent behaviors offer tantalizing hints that AI might arrive at technical solutions humans would not think of by themselves, inventing new and more efficient types of algorithms or neural networks—or even ditching neural networks, a cornerstone of modern AI, entirely.\nClune likes to remind people that intelligence has already emerged from simple beginnings. “What’s interesting about this approach is that we know it can work,” he says. “The very simple algorithm of Darwinian evolution produced your brain, and your brain is the most intelligent learning algorithm in the universe that we know so far.” His point is that if intelligence as we know it resulted from the mindless mutation of genes over countless generations, why not seek to replicate the intelligence-producing process—which is arguably simpler—rather than intelligence itself? \nBut there’s another crucial observation here. Intelligence was never an endpoint for evolution, something to aim for. Instead, it emerged in many different forms from countless tiny solutions to challenges that allowed living things to survive and take on future challenges. Intelligence is the current high point in an ongoing and open-ended process. In this sense, evolution is quite different from algorithms the way people typically think of them—as means to an end. \nIt’s this open-endedness, glimpsed in the apparently aimless sequence of challenges generated by POET, that Clune and others believe could lead to new kinds of AI. For decades AI researchers have tried to build algorithms to mimic human intelligence, but the real breakthrough may come from building algorithms that try to mimic the open-ended problem-solving of evolution—and sitting back to watch what emerges. \nResearchers are already using machine learning on itself, training it to find solutions to some of the field’s hardest problems, such as how to make machines that can learn more than one task at a time or cope with situations they have not encountered before. Some now think that taking this approach and running with it might be the best path to artificial general intelligence. “We could start an algorithm that initially does not have much intelligence inside it, and watch it bootstrap itself all the way up potentially to AGI,” Clune says.\nThe truth is that for now, AGI remains a fantasy. But that’s largely because nobody knows how to make it. Advances in AI are piecemeal and carried out by humans, with progress typically involving tweaks to existing techniques or algorithms, yielding incremental leaps in performance or accuracy. Clune characterizes these efforts as attempts to discover the building blocks for artificial intelligence without knowing what you’re looking for or how many blocks you’ll need. And that’s just the start. “At some point, we have to take on the Herculean task of putting them all together,” he says.\nAsking AI to find and assemble those building blocks for us is a paradigm shift. It’s saying we want to create an intelligent machine, but we don’t care what it might look like—just give us whatever works. \nEven if AGI is never achieved, the self-teaching approach may still change what sorts of AI are created. The world needs more than a very good Go player, says Clune. For him, creating a supersmart machine means building a system that invents its own challenges, solves them, and then invents new ones. POET is a tiny glimpse of this in action. Clune imagines a machine that teaches a bot to walk, then to play hopscotch, then maybe to play Go. “Then maybe it learns math puzzles and starts inventing its own challenges,” he says. “The system continuously innovates, and the sky’s the limit in terms of where it might go.”\nIt’s wild speculation, perhaps, but one hope is that machines like this might be able to evade our conceptual dead ends, helping us unpick vastly complex crises such as climate change or global health. \nBut first we have to make one. \nHow to create a brain\nThere are many different ways to wire up an artificial brain.\nNeural networks are made from multiple layers of artificial neurons encoded in software. Each neuron can be connected to others in the layers above. The way a neural network is wired makes a big difference, and new architectures often lead to new breakthroughs. \nThe neural networks coded by human scientists are often the result of trial and error. There is little theory to what does and doesn’t work, and no guarantee that the best designs have been found. That’s why automating the hunt for better neural-network designs has been one of the hottest topics in AI since at least the 1980s. The most common way to automate the process is to let an AI generate many possible network designs, and let the network automatically try each of them and choose the best ones. This is commonly known as neuro-evolution or neural architecture search (NAS).\nIn the last few years, these machine designs have started to outstrip human ones. In 2018, Esteban Real and his colleagues at Google used NAS to generate a neural network for image recognition that beat the best human-designed networks at the time. That was an eye-opener.\nThe 2018 system is part of an ongoing Google project called AutoML, which has also used NAS to produce EfficientNets, a family of deep-learning models that are more efficient than human-designed ones, achieving high levels of accuracy on image-recognition tasks with smaller, faster models.\nThree years on, Real is pushing the boundaries of what can be generated from scratch. The earlier systems just rearranged tried and tested neural-network pieces, such as existing types of layers or components. “We could expect a good answer,” he says.\nLast year Real and his team took the training wheels off. The new system, called AutoML Zero, tries to build an AI from the ground up using nothing but the most basic mathematical concepts that govern machine learning.\nAmazingly, not only did AutoML Zero spontaneously build a neural network, but it came up with gradient descent, the most common mathematical technique that human designers use to train a network. “I was quite surprised,” says Real. “It’s a very simple algorithm—it takes like six lines of code—but it wrote the exact six lines.”\nAutoML Zero is not yet generating architectures that rival the performance of human-designed systems—or indeed doing much that a human designer would not have done. But Real believes it could one day.\nTime to train a new kind of teacher\nFirst you make a brain; then you have to teach it. But machine brains don’t learn the way ours do. Our brains are fantastic at adapting to new environments and new tasks. Today’s AIs can solve challenges under certain conditions but fail when those conditions change even a little. This inflexibility is hampering the quest to create more generalizable AI that can be useful across a wide range of scenarios, which would be a big step toward making them truly intelligent.\nFor Jane Wang, a researcher at DeepMind in London, the best way to make AI more flexible is to get it to learn that trait itself. In other words, she wants to build an AI that not only learns specific tasks but learns to learn those tasks in ways that can be adapted to fresh situations. \nResearchers have been trying to make AI more adaptable for years. Wang thinks that getting AI to work through this problem for itself avoids some of the trial and error of a hand-designed approach: “We can’t possibly expect to stumble upon the right answer right away.” In the process, she hopes, we will also learn more about how brains work. “There’s still so much we don’t understand about the way that humans and animals learn,” she says.\nThere are two main approaches to generating learning algorithms automatically, but both start with an existing neural network and use AI to teach it.\nThe first approach, invented separately by Wang and her colleagues at DeepMind and by a team at OpenAI at around the same time, uses recurrent neural networks. This type of network can be trained in such a way that the activations of their neurons—roughly akin to the firing of neurons in biological brains—encode any type of algorithm. DeepMind and OpenAI took advantage of this to train a recurrent neural network to generate reinforcement-learning algorithms, which tell an AI how to behave to achieve given goals. \nThe upshot is that the DeepMind and OpenAI systems do not learn an algorithm that solve a specific challenge, such as recognizing images, but learn a learning algorithm that can be applied to multiple tasks and adapt as it goes. It’s like the old adage about teaching someone to fish: whereas a hand-designed algorithm can learn a particular task, these AIs are being made to learn how to learn by themselves. And some of them are performing better than human-designed ones.\nThe second approach comes from Chelsea Finn at the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues. Called model-agnostic meta-learning, or MAML, it trains a model using two machine-learning processes, one nested inside the other. \nRoughly, here’s how it works. The inner process in MAML is trained on data and then tested—as usual. But then the outer model takes the performance of the inner model—how well it identifies images, say—and uses it to learn how to adjust that model’s learning algorithm to boost performance. It’s as if you had an school inspector watching over a bunch of teachers, each offering different learning techniques. The inspector checks which techniques help the students get the best scores and tweaks them accordingly. \nThrough these approaches, researchers are building AI that is more robust, more generalized, and able to learn faster with less data. For example, Finn wants a robot that has learned to walk on flat ground to be able to transition, with minimal extra training, to walking on a slope or on grass or while carrying a load. \nLast year, Clune and his colleagues extended Finn’s technique to design an algorithm that learns using fewer neurons so that it does not overwrite everything it has learned previously, a big unsolved problem in machine learning known as catastrophic forgetting. A trained model that uses fewer neurons, known as a “sparse” model, will have more unused neurons left over to dedicate to new tasks when retrained, which means that fewer of the “used” neurons will get overwritten. Clune found that setting his AI the challenge of learning more than one task led it to come up with its own version of a sparse model that outperformed human-designed ones. \nIf we’re going all in on letting AI create and teach itself, then AIs should generate their own training environments, too—the schools and textbooks, as well as the lesson plans.\nAnd the past year has seen a raft of projects in which AI has been trained on automatically generated data. Face-recognition systems are being trained with AI-generated faces, for example. AIs are also learning how to train each other. In one recent example, two robot arms worked together, with one arm learning to set tougher and tougher block-stacking challenges that trained the other to grip and grasp objects.\nIn fact, Clune wonders if human intuition about what kind of data an AI needs in order to learn may be off. For example, he and his colleagues have developed what he calls generative teaching networks, which learn what data they should generate to get the best results when training a model. In one experiment, he used one of these networks to adapt a data set of handwritten numbers that’s often used to train image-recognition algorithms. What it came up with looked very different from the original human-curated data set: hundreds of not-quite digits, such as the top half of the figure seven or what looked like two digits merged together. Some AI-generated examples were hard to decipher at all. Despite this, the AI-generated data still did a great job at training the handwriting recognition system to identify actual digits. \nDon’t try to succeed\nAI-generated data is still just a part of the puzzle. The long-term vision is to take all these techniques—and others not yet invented—and hand them over to an AI trainer that controls how artificial brains are wired, how they are trained, and what they are trained on. Even Clune is not clear on what such a future system would look like. Sometimes he talks about a kind of hyper-realistic simulated sandbox, where AIs can cut their teeth and skin their virtual knees. Something that complex is still years away. The closest thing yet is POET, the system Clune created with Uber’s Rui Wang and others.\nPOET was motivated by a paradox, says Wang. If you try to solve a problem you’ll fail; if you don’t try to solve it you’re more likely to succeed. This is one of the insights Clune takes from his analogy with evolution—amazing results that emerge from an apparently random process often cannot be re-created by taking deliberate steps toward the same end. There’s no doubt that butterflies exist, but rewind to their single-celled precursors and try to create them from scratch by choosing each step from bacterium to bug, and you’d likely fail.\nPOET starts its two-legged agent off in a simple environment, such as a flat path without obstacles. At first the agent doesn’t know what to do with its legs and cannot walk. But through trial and error, the reinforcement-learning algorithm controlling it learns how to move along flat ground. POET then generates a new random environment that’s different, but not necessarily harder to move in. The agent tries walking there. If there are obstacles in this new environment, the agent learns how to get over or across those. Every time an agent succeeds or gets stuck, it is moved to a new environment. Over time, the agents learn a range of walking and jumping actions that let them navigate harder and harder obstacle courses.\nThe team found that random switching of environments was essential.\nFor example, agents sometimes learned to walk on flat ground with a weird, half-kneeling shuffle, because that was good enough. “They never learn to stand up because they never need to,” says Wang. But after they had been forced to learn alternative strategies on obstacle-strewn ground, they could return to the early stage with a better way of walking—using both legs instead of dragging one behind, say—and then take that improved version of itself forward to harder challenges.\nPOET trains its bots in a way that no human would—it takes erratic, unintuitive paths to success. At each stage, the bots try to figure out a solution to whatever challenge they are presented with. By coping with a random selection of obstacles thrown their way, they get better overall. But there is no end point to this process, no ultimate test to pass or high score to beat. \nClune, Wang, and a number of their colleagues believe this is a profound insight. They are now exploring what it might mean for the development of supersmart machines. Could trying not to chart a specific path actually be a key breakthrough on the way to artificial general intelligence? \nPOET is already inspiring other researchers, such as Natasha Jaques and Michael Dennis at the University of California, Berkeley.

Threat actors have attacked critical zero-day flaws in the email software: an unrelenting cyber campaign that the US government has described as “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/06/microsoft-ioc-detection-tool-exchange-server-vulnerabilities\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/06/microsoft-ioc-detection-tool-exchange-server-vulnerabilities\" target=\"_blank\">widespread domestic and international exploitation</a>” that could affect hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Gaining visibility into an issue like this requires a full understanding of all assets connected to a company’s network. This type of continuous tracking of inventory doesn’t scale with how humans work, but machines can handle it easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For business executives with multiple, post-pandemic priorities, the time is now to start prioritizing security. “It’s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run,” observes Matt Kraning, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cortex Xpanse, an attack surface management software vendor recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might ask why companies don’t simply patch their systems and make these problems disappear. If only it were that simple. Unless businesses have implemented a way to find and keep track of their assets, that supposedly simple question is a head-scratcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But businesses have a tough time answering what seems like a straightforward question: namely, how many routers, servers, or assets do they have? If cybersecurity executives don’t know the answer, it’s impossible to then convey an accurate level of vulnerability to the board of directors. And if the board doesn’t understand the risk—and is blindsided by something even worse than the Exchange Server and 2020 SolarWinds attacks—well, the story almost writes itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why Kraning thinks it’s so important to create a minimum set of standards. And, he says, “Boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics.” Because without that level of understanding, boards aren’t asking the right questions—and cybersecurity executives aren’t having the right conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraning believes attack service management is a better way to secure companies with a continuous process of asset discovery, including the discovery of all assets exposed to the public internet—what he calls “unknown unknowns.” New assets can appear from anywhere at any time. “This is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that&#8217;s being developed,” Kraning says. “Once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward.” And that’s better for not just companies, but for the entire corporate ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Show notes and links:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceosurvey/2021.html?\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceosurvey/2021.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A leadership agenda to take on tomorrow</a>,” Global CEO Survey survey, PwC</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Full transcript</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel Ruma</em>: From MIT Technology Review, I&#8217;m Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our topic today is attack surface management. Where will your next cybersecurity breach come from? Enterprises have more and more things attached to their internet, including ever-expanding networks and aging infrastructure. And as attackers become more creative, executives will have to as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two words for you: unknown unknowns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guest is Matt Kraning, who is the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, which was recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks. Matt is an expert in large-scale optimization, distributed sensing, and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. Prior to co-founding Expanse, Matt worked for DARPA, including a deployment to Afghanistan. Matt holds PhD and master&#8217;s degrees from Stanford University. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks. Welcome, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt Kraning</em>: Thank you so much. Very happy to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: From the very beginning, you’ve been an expert in large-scale distributed sensing and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. How did that expertise lead you to co-found a company in the field of attack surface management?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Well, I&#8217;ll say a few things. Attack surface management is what we wound up calling it, but it was actually a very long journey to that and we didn&#8217;t really set out knowing that that&#8217;s exactly what it would be called or what precisely we would be doing. So there&#8217;s not even a Gartner category, which is a certain way of validating the existence for a market segment. That is actually still coming out. So the field of attack surface management, we actually invented ourselves. And a lot of invention means that there&#8217;s a lot of discovery going into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike a lot of enterprise security and IT companies where, in a lot of cases, most companies founded are usually going into an existing market—they&#8217;re doing usually an incremental or evolutionary advancement on top of what has already been invented—we actually took another approach and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really, with fresh eyes, asking, ‘What is not being served in the market today?’&#8221; And came up with the idea of, &#8220;Is the internet, with all of its promise, actually going to be a strategic liability for organizations, no longer just a strategic asset?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We developed a lot of techniques and technologies to basically look at all of the internet as a dataset: to gather, continuously, information about the internet, which is really where our backgrounds came in both from academia and then also from our work in the defense and intelligence communities, in places like DARPA, and at various places in the US intelligence agencies. And we said, actually, there seems to be a whole bunch of stuff broken on the internet, and surprisingly, a lot of it is actually associated with very large, very important companies. It was scratching on that question that actually led us to both founding Expanse and then also creating what would be the first and is the leading product in what is now known as attack surface management, which is really understanding all of the assets that you have, understanding the risks that they might pose and then also fixing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when we founded Expanse back in 2012, we didn&#8217;t know that it was going to be attack surface management. We didn&#8217;t even have the name attack surface management. Instead it was very problem-focused on, &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a lot of weird and dangerous things on the internet and a lot of security vulnerabilities. Let&#8217;s double-click on that a lot and actually see if there&#8217;s a way to build a business around that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: And how much the internet has changed in these nine short years, right? When you talk about that data set and in trying to find information of where the biggest security risks are, how hard was it to find? Did you look around and see, &#8220;Oh, look, there are entire datasets, you could track back easily to these companies. They&#8217;re leaking.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Things aren&#8217;t secure.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I love the phrase, &#8220;Everything is obvious once you know the answer.&#8221; I think initially one of the main challenges is that in order to even show how large this problem is, you actually need to gather the data. And gathering the data is not easy, especially on a continuous or regular basis, you actually have to have a lot of systems engineering background, a lot of distributed systems background to actually gather data on everything. I think what made our approach unique is that we actually said, &#8220;What if we gather data on every single system on the internet?&#8221; Which is actually enabled by a lot of both cost advantages enabled by things like cloud computing, but also software advantages both in open source and things that we would write ourselves. And then, rather than starting from things that you know about a company and trying to assess their risks, we said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we start with everything on the internet and then try to whittle it down to what is interesting?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of very good insights came out of that where again, almost by accident, we started discovering that we would actually find many, many more security problems than organizations actually knew about themselves. When I&#8217;m talking to organizations, I&#8217;m not talking to small businesses. I&#8217;m talking military services. I am talking Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 100 companies, Fortune 10 companies. Even the largest, most complex, but also the best finance, most elite customers had problems for security. And what really our discovery and our journey in creating the category, in creating attack surface management as an idea was that we find all of these security vulnerabilities and all of these assets in far-flung places anywhere on the internet, and they will occur for a multitude of reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was actually interesting because while the security challenges and security risks were very real, the real symptoms that we found, that we discovered, were actually that organizations did not have an effective means to track all of the assets that they had online and to simultaneously assess the security posture of those assets and to simultaneously fix and remediate and mitigate the risks of those opposed to the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that was one of the very interesting things was that looking back, we can now say, &#8220;Obviously, you want to do all of these activities.&#8221; But because we were actually doing something new that had never been done before, it was a new category, we had to discover all of that starting from the point of really, &#8220;There seems to be a lot of stuff broken on the internet. We don&#8217;t exactly know why, but let&#8217;s go investigate.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: That&#8217;s a good way of thinking of it, starting with a different place and then working your way backwards. So Matt, according to a recent PwC survey of more than 5,000 CEOs around the world, 47% are extremely concerned about cybersecurity. Now, 47% doesn&#8217;t sound like a large number to me, shouldn&#8217;t it be closer to 100%?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I would say that every CEO I’ve talked to is concerned about it on some level. And I think a lot depends on where they are. Overall, what we&#8217;ve noticed is a very large uptick, especially in the last five years, of the attentiveness of the CEOs and boards of directors to cybersecurity issues. Where I think we&#8217;ve seen a lag, though I think there are a few exceptions in this area, is that a lot of both tools and presentations that go, especially for executive audiences, for cybersecurity risks do not effectively convey everything that those people need to make effective decisions. And I think this is challenging for a variety of reasons, especially that a lot of CEOs and boards do not necessarily have the full technical background in order to do so. But I think it&#8217;s also been a failure to date in industry to be able to provide those tools. And I think we&#8217;re going to see more and more changes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I equate it to really the state of finance before Sarbanes-Oxley that basically started to require CEOs to get training, and boards as well, to start to understand certain financial metrics, to actually have certain controls in place. I think at the high level, we are going to have to see something like that in the coming years be implemented in some way to say that there are a minimum set of standards and that boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics. Right now, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people say, &#8220;I am concerned about this, but then I also don&#8217;t really know where to go next&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;m conversant. We got a report. We hired some firm. They had this presentation that had a whole bunch of PowerPoint slides with a lot of charts that would have Christmas tree lights that made my brain melt. And I could not really understand the concepts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think people get it, but we&#8217;re still in the early days of, How do you have effective controls over this? And then how do you actually have programs that are robust around it? Again, we need to move in that direction because more and more boards need to see this as a foundational aspect of their company, especially as pretty much all companies today, I don&#8217;t care what industry you&#8217;re in, what size, your company actually runs on IT. It&#8217;s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run. And as a result of the understanding of cybersecurity at those levels, with attack surface being now a part of that, is very important for organizations to be able to understand, because otherwise you will put your organization at a very large amount of risk by not being able to properly assess things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Yeah. And that gets back to the old adage, every company is a technology company. But maybe this is a more specific example of how it is. Could you briefly describe what attack surface management is, maybe perhaps for that executive audience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: The way that we describe attack surface management is it&#8217;s effectively a three-step process where all steps are done continuously in the form of cycle, but it is a process and procedure by which you, or really a vendor, in this case Expanse or Palo Alto Networks, continuously discover all assets that an organization has. In our case, from external attack surface, all assets that you have on the public internet. And that is a continuous process because at any given time, and I can go into this later, but at any given time, new assets could appear from anywhere on the internet. So you need to have a continuous discovery process that says, &#8220;At any given time, I might not know everything about my assets so I should have mechanisms to gather information about anywhere that they could be and try to associate them to my organization.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time as soon as an asset is discovered, you have to have means to evaluate it across a variety of different characteristics. In many cases, if I&#8217;ve discovered a new asset, is this asset actually truly new? And if it is not, then matching, normalizing, deduplicating that with other things. If it is a new asset, then in most cases, it&#8217;s actually going to be unmanaged. So how do I actually start a slew of activities to say, &#8220;This is an asset that exists with mine, but it usually exists outside of an intended set of security controls. So how do I start a process to both assess what controls need to be put in place and then bring it under management.&#8221; And the third part of evaluation is also understanding what is the risk that this poses immediately to my organization to help me prioritize activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final step is what we call mitigation. Once you&#8217;ve evaluated everything that you&#8217;ve discovered, what do you actually do about it? What actions do you take and how do you do so in highly automated and effective ways. And for us, there are two primary steps that mitigation involves. I mentioned prioritization, but it&#8217;s one, bringing systems under management. In a lot of cases, what that also means is that for most systems associated with our large customers, it actually means taking them either off the internet directly, so we&#8217;re putting them behind a VPN or other sort of corporate device, or making sure that they are then known and then up-to-date because in a lot of cases, the real symptom of security problems that we find happens to be around the fact that an asset was just unmanaged for a very long time and may contain security vulnerabilities that were later discovered simply because you would have security patches that exist for known security issues that had not been applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain cases, such as zero-day attacks, it&#8217;s actually just much more important to know where all the assets are so you can patch them as soon as possible. But for the larger majority of assets that we discover for our customers and help manage their attack surface, the real problem is that the assets are just not known. And for executives, the real key is that the existing processes and tools that a lot of companies use can be very good from this certain side of security, but they assume that networks are effectively a lot more static.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So what are the ramifications of an enterprise not knowing their actual attack surface?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: The large, most obvious one is an increased risk of breach. I think it was an adage throughout a lot of the 2000s, helped on in no small part by vendors, that everything started from email phishing. And there&#8217;s very, very large email security vendors that still pumped this message that it&#8217;s every single security incident is effectively a phishing email and that humans are the weakest link when they&#8217;re clicking on things, and therefore buy more email security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s wrong. I think it&#8217;s actually correct that security is a big thing, you can buy it. But it&#8217;s also much easier to mitigate especially now with a lot of good tools, like you actually have full visibility over all emails being sent to employees because they have to go through a central mail server. It&#8217;s actually a question of just being able to detect bad things but not actually needing to find out that there were, say, emails being sent that you didn&#8217;t have visibility into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in contrast, what we&#8217;ve seen, especially more recently over the last decade and really even the last five years, is some of the absolute worst breaches, the ones that cause hundreds of millions to billions of dollars damage, are not coming from phishing. They are actually coming from usually unknown and unmonitored assets and that in many cases, were actually on the public internet. So I think some of the largest examples of this are actually things like the WannaCry attack, which caused, it&#8217;s estimated over $10 billion worldwide in damage, shut down entire companies, putting most of the health-care system of the United Kingdom back on pen and paper for actual days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the real ramifications are, you have all these extra avenues to get in because there are so many more assets that are online that are not being tracked by organizations, and that is actually how attackers are getting in because it turns out that there are very efficient, automated ways for attackers to understand and probe for and exploit these attacks surfaces. And the ramifications are quite bold. You see most of the healthcare of a first-world country reduced to pen and paper for days. Very, very serious because it&#8217;s not just hacking someone&#8217;s email, it&#8217;s actually hacking the critical infrastructure of the network itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: Speaking of critical infrastructure, another recent attack is the water treatment plant in Florida, where an attacker was able to remotely change the chemical makeup of the water to add lye to it, which could have poisoned an entire community. So then, infrastructure is an enormous issue for very large companies, like water treatment plants or oil and gas companies, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Absolutely. In that case, to the best of my understanding, the attack vector there was actually a remote access server that someone at that plant left open, was on the internet, and allowed someone to go in. What our tech services are about is we&#8217;re finding ways in that are effectively tools of IT convenience but that are able to be subverted by attackers because the tools of IT convenience are not hardened to the same degree as other things that are meant to be on the internet and are left out as a matter of course. We have this line that we like to view the internet in most ways as what most of us experienced through our web browsers or on our phone. It&#8217;s this really nice setup consumer experience and all of the webpages we view looks very nice and pleasing and we go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a good analogy to the physical world like I guess, soon after we&#8217;re all vaccinated from covid-19, we&#8217;ll be back shopping outside. You might go to a Starbucks and the store is really nice, you have this great experience, you get your latte, you go out, but then if you look beneath all of the glitz on the streets, you actually have much older infrastructure. You have things like no sewer pipes and other things that are greasy and cracking. And that&#8217;s the infrastructure that supports the more beautiful world on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of what we see as part of attack surface is an IT analogy that most people view the internet really as just, &#8220;What&#8217;s in their web browser? What&#8217;s on the phone, these nice consumer websites?&#8221; But there&#8217;s entire backend IT infrastructure that supports that. And it&#8217;s somewhat creaky and it&#8217;s not always well-configured. Without something like ASM, you have problems that you don&#8217;t actually know the state of your network because it&#8217;s so large, distributed, and complex. And as in the case with Florida, which by the way was a smaller organization, it goes to the heart of how do you know that something is not going on? Under any IT security policy, having a remote access service on the internet should not be allowed. But it&#8217;s very hard even for smaller organizations to get that continuous visibility of, what do I actually look like from the outside? What do I look like to an attacker with legacy tools?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: And that&#8217;s a good example of an attack that&#8217;s not a phishing attack. It has nothing to do with the email. While we&#8217;re on the discussion of attacks, most memorably this year again, SolarWinds and Exchange, how would implementing ASM have changed those outcomes for organizations? Or how about those lucky organizations that actually understood their attack surface management options and were able to find this and thwart the attack?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I&#8217;ll speak to both because a number of our customers had both of those kinds of systems and we helped them respond. I think the Microsoft Exchange hacks, and for your listeners, a bit of background: there was actually a set of zero-days announced for the sets of versions of the Microsoft Exchange email services earlier in February and March of this year. Very, very dangerous because in effect, these are the mail servers of an organization and if you followed this XY chain, what it basically allowed you to do was send a message to a mail server to grant you effectively unfettered administrative access to the entire mail server. And there were actually hundreds of thousands of these that we detected online. And effectively, if you think about it, having an attacker being able to download all or most of the corporate mail server and with all of these sensitive information that&#8217;s stored there, is a very serious attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we noticed were actually two things, which was, for large organizations, they were very aware of this and they were patching very, very rapidly. But there were a number of customers that we were able to help where they&#8217;re so large that they actually don&#8217;t even have one central set of mail servers. So without Expanse, they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to find even all of their mail servers and be able to patch them in time because they are so distributed, they actually needed an inventory of even their mail servers. And it&#8217;s very hard to aggregate that in one central way unless you&#8217;re using an ASM tool like Expanse. Because instead, in a lot of cases, you&#8217;re usually using Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Excel. You&#8217;re going to be sending emails to different business units. You&#8217;re going to be asking IT leaders in those different business units. If they&#8217;re patched, they will be sending emails and spreadsheets back. It&#8217;s a very, very manual process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So able to actually identify that and really help them in a very short order of, like, a day, find and be able to fix every single server they had on their estate, which we think really, really changed the outcome, because they could have been vulnerable for weeks in certain cases. For SolarWinds as well, I think the details are a bit different because not all SolarWinds assets are necessarily exposed to the internet. And also in a lot of cases, they&#8217;d been there for months. As part of broader Palo Alto, we had other products that were able to stop SolarWinds: the SolarWinds attack in particular, our endpoint framework called XDR. But even there for SolarWinds, once the attack was known, customers still have the problem of, they didn&#8217;t even know where all of their SolarWinds servers were, which again goes back to this inventory problem and choosing capabilities, both like Expanse and other capabilities we now have as part of Palo Alto, we were able to actually help customers very rapidly understand everywhere they had a SolarWinds exposure so that they could mitigate that very quickly. So there was effectively a two-step process. At Palo Alto, we were able to prevent the attack on our customers even without knowing that the supply chain had been breached. And then once it was more public, we were actually able to then also help everyone identify all of the servers that they had and make sure that they were all up to date and not infected with the supply-chain Trojan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: That&#8217;s really interesting because some companies may be thinking, &#8220;Oh, well, we don&#8217;t have water plants and aging infrastructure to worry about.&#8221; But do you actually know where all your mail is stored and how many different servers it may be on and different cloud instances or wherever? And when you do only have a matter of hours to make this critical patch, how quickly can you do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Exactly. And a lot of the questions that I asked our customers are just, &#8220;How do you have confidence that, effectively, your systems are up to date?&#8221; Answering even seemingly basic sounding questions with existing IT, if you don&#8217;t have Expanse or ASM, is actually surprisingly hard. I&#8217;ll give another fun example. I ask chief information security officers this all the time: &#8220;How many routers does your organization have?&#8221; It seems like a pretty basic question, seems like they’d know, at least to a very good approximation, the IT team should probably know exactly how many routers they have. They&#8217;re very important pieces of networking equipment, especially at the enterprise level, they&#8217;re more expensive. So it&#8217;s not just like that home Wi-Fi hotspot that we&#8217;re used to. These things can cost tens, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars to handle enterprise-grade workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we find is that when you ask that question, there&#8217;s actually usually not one central place where all that&#8217;s tracked. Instead, it will be tracked by local development and IT teams in different ways. It will be tracked in multiple spreadsheets. There may be certain local IT management systems that know that, but at the end of it, if you said like, &#8220;How many routers do you have right now?&#8221; The process that they would use to answer that is not going into a system or logging in, it&#8217;s actually starting an email chain. That&#8217;s actually the one of the main problems that attack surface management attempts to solve, is, How do you have an accurate and up-to-date inventory of everything so that you can then build a variety of processes on top of that, including security? But if you don&#8217;t have an up-to-date inventory or you think you do, but you don&#8217;t, then when you start to pull on that thread, a lot of business processes, a lot of IT processes, a lot of security processes that you want to have apply across your entire enterprise, all of a sudden you&#8217;re realizing, &#8220;Wait, this actually is only being partially implemented because if I don&#8217;t have a full inventory, how do I actually know what&#8217;s going over all of my assets as opposed to just the assets I know about?&#8221; And that&#8217;s what we talk about when we say “unknown unknowns.” As you mentioned at the top, it&#8217;s, &#8220;I know some degree of my systems, but do I know all of them?&#8221; That delta can be everything for organizations because most of their risk is in the parts of their network they did not even know to investigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: What other data-driven decisions can be made from this sort of focus on actually knowing where all your assets are. How else can this help the business?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Two areas that this really helps organizations with is actually cloud governance and M&amp;A. Particularly, these are very sprawling enterprises. So for a lot of our customers, they might actually have hundreds of different cloud accounts in the public cloud providers, so AWS, Azure, Oracle, Google, Alibaba in a lot of cases, and they had no way to actually rationalize this because they would have a whole bunch of different development teams and they couldn&#8217;t get something. And so, when they say that they are moving to the cloud, a typical refrain from our customers will be like, &#8220;Yes, we are. We have deals with Amazon and we&#8217;re hedging our bets a little bit. We&#8217;re also exploring Azure so we&#8217;re not solely locked into one cloud.&#8221; What we find is that the average customer for Expanse is in 11 different infrastructure providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not talking SaaS, I&#8217;m talking in places that you actually get like renting a server, putting data on yourself. It&#8217;s amazing and astronomical and we could say, &#8220;Well, yeah, you are on Azure. You&#8217;re also on AWS. Did you know that you&#8217;re also in DigitalOcean? You&#8217;re also in Linode. Your general manager in Europe probably put you in OVH or Orange hosting. You have something else in the Malaysian data center. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what that is.” And that&#8217;s typical. One customer for us was actually in over a hundred different providers because they&#8217;re a very large multinational. I think that&#8217;s when we see that people&#8217;s cloud governance plans versus cloud reality are dramatically different. And helping them with that will enable them to move both securely and quickly to the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second one is mergers and acquisitions. I think this is something that is increasingly happening. As a lot of industries are consolidating, there&#8217;s a lot of M&amp;A activity more recently. But when you think about it, an M&amp;A is one of the largest IT change events an organization can have, especially if it&#8217;s a large acquisition. So I know a little bit about this, having recently gone through this process with Palo Alto Networks on ourselves on the other side of the table, but the number of things you have to integrate is quite large. And in the case of Expanse, we&#8217;re integrated with a top security company in the world and also we are relatively small. So the integration headaches have been almost nonexistent, and it&#8217;s been a really great process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for larger organizations where you might, an organization with 50,000 people is acquiring an organization with 10,000 people, the number of different steps you have to go through, the amount of IT that you have to transfer, the amount of legacy that you have to understand is gigantic. And in a lot of ways, these are in many cases only partially implemented because as an acquirer, you might not even know where all the assets you&#8217;re acquiring are. As an example, for an airline, there was a series of mergers and we&#8217;re actually able to find assets of the merged airline that no longer exists, but were still on the internet more than a decade after the merger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which gives you an idea of just how long some of these things take. That&#8217;s the other side of, how we really help with our customers, is actually understanding, &#8220;When you actually acquire an asset, how do you actually complete that process? How do you measure it? How do you monitor it and how do you do that at the scale of the internet rather than with a lot of consultants, Excel spreadsheets, pieces of paper and emails?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>: So from our conversation today, I feel like this is the, “If you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, you should really figure it out” warning, if you haven&#8217;t heard it before. But there are glimmers of hope in this, right? Because if the asset exists, you can at least find it, track it and assess what you&#8217;re going to do with it, mediate any changes you need to make or assess it to bring it back to full cybersecurity compliance. What gives you hope about what&#8217;s possible after seeing the first three months of this year and what&#8217;s happened with attacks, the ongoing issues that we&#8217;re going to have? But there is opportunity there, right? There is hope. What are you seeing that makes you optimistic about cybersecurity and what we&#8217;re looking forward to in the next five years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m actually quite optimistic in not even the long-term but even in the medium term I think, even three, four years out. Near-term, definitely there&#8217;s going to be some rough seas ahead, but here&#8217;s what makes me most optimistic. One, I think that this is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that&#8217;s being developed. And by that, it is clear that once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward. There&#8217;s a lot of mechanistic steps to get better at that. There&#8217;s a lot of automations that can be put on that. And there&#8217;s a lot of things coming to bear. But in many cases, the actual hard part is seeing what you actually need to fix and knowing all of the set of problems and then being able to prioritize them effectively and then start working on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think in particular, the things that I&#8217;ve seen are within the industry, I think there are a lot of technologies in the few years that are going to meet the marketing hype that has been around for years. I talk a lot with industry partners. We use substantial amounts of data. With my background where I have a PhD from Stanford in operations research and machine learning, we actually do use some real actual machine learning in our products. We also use a lot of heuristics as well. I joke that we sometimes have machine learning classifiers to solve a problem. Other times we have SQL queries that solve the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have some really well-written SQL queries. I&#8217;m very proud of those. But I think that the industry itself, especially in marketing material, you would think that everything in cybersecurity is this automated AI, ML-enabled everything. In most cases, but not all, but in a lot across the industry, and this is especially true in startups, it’s just a line to pitch. And what companies really call AI are just standard software rules and there&#8217;s really nothing special going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or there&#8217;s an old joke that, &#8220;Oh, I have this great AI thing. What is it? Well, we have a bunch of analysts that are former intelligence officers, usually in Maryland or outside of Tel Aviv and they&#8217;re the ones doing everything. But we have a system that efficiently routes work to them and that&#8217;s our AI.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, that&#8217;s people.&#8221; I think what I&#8217;ve seen is that one, automation broadly defined is a real thing. But automation actually means on the ground, is you take something that previously took hours and days and 10 people. And then with software right now, it&#8217;s more so how do you take that down to 15 minutes and two or three people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that we&#8217;re going to see even larger gains or even start to take humans out of the loop entirely in certain business processes. And I think what we&#8217;re seeing and this is a lot of what we&#8217;re working on and I&#8217;m working on now is that over the next months and years, actual large-scale machine learning capability is actually being deployed in production. I think there are some that are out there in piecemeal. There&#8217;s a lot more rules than anyone wants to talk about, but we are now seeing there&#8217;s enough assemblage of data, there&#8217;s enough normalization of data in that, especially at the larger companies, and that enterprises are more willing to share information with vendors if it demonstrably improves the security service that they are getting, that we are actually going to be able to deploy increasingly sophisticated capabilities along those lines and have the product/reality match. I think that’s what at least the broader industry marketing zeitgeist had been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of them, they are very, very real and they&#8217;re very much coming. And they&#8217;re coming at an industrial scale for defenders. And I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most excited about because despite the fact that there&#8217;s the old adage of, attackers need to be right once, defenders need to be right all the time, increasingly, it is now more scalable for defenders to be right much of the time and to actually set up very vast monitoring networks so that if the attackers slip up once, the defenders can completely wipe them out in that attack. And that both asymmetrically affects cost and also I think will help tilt the field back to defense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt</em>: I think when you had partial AI solutions and ML solutions and partial automation, it helped attackers much more because they could duct-tape together a few different parts, scale up certain things very highly and then just see what came back to them in a great way. I think defenders are going to be able to have similar capabilities that are effective because they actually cover everything going on in an enterprise. And that&#8217;s going to allow us to turn the tide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laurel</em>:Matt, thank you so much for joining us today in what has been a fantastic conversation on the Business Lab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was Matt Kraning, the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, who I spoke with from Cambridge, Massachusetts, the home of MIT and MIT Technology Review, overlooking the Charles River.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it for this episode of Business Lab.

Threat actors have attacked critical zero-day flaws in the email software: an unrelenting cyber campaign that the US government has described as “widespread domestic and international exploitation” that could affect hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Gaining visibility into an issue like this requires a full understanding of all assets connected to a company’s network. This type of continuous tracking of inventory doesn’t scale with how humans work, but machines can handle it easily.\nFor business executives with multiple, post-pandemic priorities, the time is now to start prioritizing security. “It’s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run,” observes Matt Kraning, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cortex Xpanse, an attack surface management software vendor recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks.\nYou might ask why companies don’t simply patch their systems and make these problems disappear. If only it were that simple. Unless businesses have implemented a way to find and keep track of their assets, that supposedly simple question is a head-scratcher.\nBut businesses have a tough time answering what seems like a straightforward question: namely, how many routers, servers, or assets do they have? If cybersecurity executives don’t know the answer, it’s impossible to then convey an accurate level of vulnerability to the board of directors. And if the board doesn’t understand the risk—and is blindsided by something even worse than the Exchange Server and 2020 SolarWinds attacks—well, the story almost writes itself.\nThat’s why Kraning thinks it’s so important to create a minimum set of standards. And, he says, “Boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics.” Because without that level of understanding, boards aren’t asking the right questions—and cybersecurity executives aren’t having the right conversations.\nKraning believes attack service management is a better way to secure companies with a continuous process of asset discovery, including the discovery of all assets exposed to the public internet—what he calls “unknown unknowns.” New assets can appear from anywhere at any time. “This is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that’s being developed,” Kraning says. “Once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward.” And that’s better for not just companies, but for the entire corporate ecosystem.\nShow notes and links:\n“A leadership agenda to take on tomorrow,” Global CEO Survey survey, PwC\nFull transcript\nLaurel Ruma: From MIT Technology Review, I’m Laurel Ruma, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.\nOur topic today is attack surface management. Where will your next cybersecurity breach come from? Enterprises have more and more things attached to their internet, including ever-expanding networks and aging infrastructure. And as attackers become more creative, executives will have to as well.\nTwo words for you: unknown unknowns.\nMy guest is Matt Kraning, who is the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, which was recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks. Matt is an expert in large-scale optimization, distributed sensing, and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. Prior to co-founding Expanse, Matt worked for DARPA, including a deployment to Afghanistan. Matt holds PhD and master’s degrees from Stanford University. This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Palo Alto Networks. Welcome, Matt.\nMatt Kraning: Thank you so much. Very happy to be here.\nLaurel: From the very beginning, you’ve been an expert in large-scale distributed sensing and machine learning algorithms run on massively parallel systems. How did that expertise lead you to co-found a company in the field of attack surface management?\nMatt: Well, I’ll say a few things. Attack surface management is what we wound up calling it, but it was actually a very long journey to that and we didn’t really set out knowing that that’s exactly what it would be called or what precisely we would be doing. So there’s not even a Gartner category, which is a certain way of validating the existence for a market segment. That is actually still coming out. So the field of attack surface management, we actually invented ourselves. And a lot of invention means that there’s a lot of discovery going into that.\nUnlike a lot of enterprise security and IT companies where, in a lot of cases, most companies founded are usually going into an existing market—they’re doing usually an incremental or evolutionary advancement on top of what has already been invented—we actually took another approach and said, “We’re really, with fresh eyes, asking, ‘What is not being served in the market today?’” And came up with the idea of, “Is the internet, with all of its promise, actually going to be a strategic liability for organizations, no longer just a strategic asset?”\nWe developed a lot of techniques and technologies to basically look at all of the internet as a dataset: to gather, continuously, information about the internet, which is really where our backgrounds came in both from academia and then also from our work in the defense and intelligence communities, in places like DARPA, and at various places in the US intelligence agencies. And we said, actually, there seems to be a whole bunch of stuff broken on the internet, and surprisingly, a lot of it is actually associated with very large, very important companies. It was scratching on that question that actually led us to both founding Expanse and then also creating what would be the first and is the leading product in what is now known as attack surface management, which is really understanding all of the assets that you have, understanding the risks that they might pose and then also fixing problems.\nBut when we founded Expanse back in 2012, we didn’t know that it was going to be attack surface management. We didn’t even have the name attack surface management. Instead it was very problem-focused on, “We’re seeing a lot of weird and dangerous things on the internet and a lot of security vulnerabilities. Let’s double-click on that a lot and actually see if there’s a way to build a business around that.”\nLaurel: And how much the internet has changed in these nine short years, right? When you talk about that data set and in trying to find information of where the biggest security risks are, how hard was it to find? Did you look around and see, “Oh, look, there are entire datasets, you could track back easily to these companies. They’re leaking.” Or, “Things aren’t secure.”\nMatt: I love the phrase, “Everything is obvious once you know the answer.” I think initially one of the main challenges is that in order to even show how large this problem is, you actually need to gather the data. And gathering the data is not easy, especially on a continuous or regular basis, you actually have to have a lot of systems engineering background, a lot of distributed systems background to actually gather data on everything. I think what made our approach unique is that we actually said, “What if we gather data on every single system on the internet?” Which is actually enabled by a lot of both cost advantages enabled by things like cloud computing, but also software advantages both in open source and things that we would write ourselves. And then, rather than starting from things that you know about a company and trying to assess their risks, we said, “Why don’t we start with everything on the internet and then try to whittle it down to what is interesting?”\nAnd a lot of very good insights came out of that where again, almost by accident, we started discovering that we would actually find many, many more security problems than organizations actually knew about themselves. When I’m talking to organizations, I’m not talking to small businesses. I’m talking military services. I am talking Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 100 companies, Fortune 10 companies. Even the largest, most complex, but also the best finance, most elite customers had problems for security. And what really our discovery and our journey in creating the category, in creating attack surface management as an idea was that we find all of these security vulnerabilities and all of these assets in far-flung places anywhere on the internet, and they will occur for a multitude of reasons.\nBut it was actually interesting because while the security challenges and security risks were very real, the real symptoms that we found, that we discovered, were actually that organizations did not have an effective means to track all of the assets that they had online and to simultaneously assess the security posture of those assets and to simultaneously fix and remediate and mitigate the risks of those opposed to the organization.\nAnd I think that was one of the very interesting things was that looking back, we can now say, “Obviously, you want to do all of these activities.” But because we were actually doing something new that had never been done before, it was a new category, we had to discover all of that starting from the point of really, “There seems to be a lot of stuff broken on the internet. We don’t exactly know why, but let’s go investigate.”\nLaurel: That’s a good way of thinking of it, starting with a different place and then working your way backwards. So Matt, according to a recent PwC survey of more than 5,000 CEOs around the world, 47% are extremely concerned about cybersecurity. Now, 47% doesn’t sound like a large number to me, shouldn’t it be closer to 100%?\nMatt: I would say that every CEO I’ve talked to is concerned about it on some level. And I think a lot depends on where they are. Overall, what we’ve noticed is a very large uptick, especially in the last five years, of the attentiveness of the CEOs and boards of directors to cybersecurity issues. Where I think we’ve seen a lag, though I think there are a few exceptions in this area, is that a lot of both tools and presentations that go, especially for executive audiences, for cybersecurity risks do not effectively convey everything that those people need to make effective decisions. And I think this is challenging for a variety of reasons, especially that a lot of CEOs and boards do not necessarily have the full technical background in order to do so. But I think it’s also been a failure to date in industry to be able to provide those tools. And I think we’re going to see more and more changes there.\nI equate it to really the state of finance before Sarbanes-Oxley that basically started to require CEOs to get training, and boards as well, to start to understand certain financial metrics, to actually have certain controls in place. I think at the high level, we are going to have to see something like that in the coming years be implemented in some way to say that there are a minimum set of standards and that boards and senior executives need to be minimally conversant in some ways about cybersecurity risk and analysis of those metrics. Right now, I’ve seen a lot of people say, “I am concerned about this, but then I also don’t really know where to go next” or, “I’m conversant. We got a report. We hired some firm. They had this presentation that had a whole bunch of PowerPoint slides with a lot of charts that would have Christmas tree lights that made my brain melt. And I could not really understand the concepts.”\nI think people get it, but we’re still in the early days of, How do you have effective controls over this? And then how do you actually have programs that are robust around it? Again, we need to move in that direction because more and more boards need to see this as a foundational aspect of their company, especially as pretty much all companies today, I don’t care what industry you’re in, what size, your company actually runs on IT. It’s pretty much impossible these days to run almost any size company where if your IT goes down, your company is still able to run. And as a result of the understanding of cybersecurity at those levels, with attack surface being now a part of that, is very important for organizations to be able to understand, because otherwise you will put your organization at a very large amount of risk by not being able to properly assess things like that.\nLaurel: Yeah. And that gets back to the old adage, every company is a technology company. But maybe this is a more specific example of how it is. Could you briefly describe what attack surface management is, maybe perhaps for that executive audience?\nMatt: The way that we describe attack surface management is it’s effectively a three-step process where all steps are done continuously in the form of cycle, but it is a process and procedure by which you, or really a vendor, in this case Expanse or Palo Alto Networks, continuously discover all assets that an organization has. In our case, from external attack surface, all assets that you have on the public internet. And that is a continuous process because at any given time, and I can go into this later, but at any given time, new assets could appear from anywhere on the internet. So you need to have a continuous discovery process that says, “At any given time, I might not know everything about my assets so I should have mechanisms to gather information about anywhere that they could be and try to associate them to my organization.”\nAt the same time as soon as an asset is discovered, you have to have means to evaluate it across a variety of different characteristics. In many cases, if I’ve discovered a new asset, is this asset actually truly new? And if it is not, then matching, normalizing, deduplicating that with other things. If it is a new asset, then in most cases, it’s actually going to be unmanaged. So how do I actually start a slew of activities to say, “This is an asset that exists with mine, but it usually exists outside of an intended set of security controls. So how do I start a process to both assess what controls need to be put in place and then bring it under management.” And the third part of evaluation is also understanding what is the risk that this poses immediately to my organization to help me prioritize activities.\nThe final step is what we call mitigation. Once you’ve evaluated everything that you’ve discovered, what do you actually do about it? What actions do you take and how do you do so in highly automated and effective ways. And for us, there are two primary steps that mitigation involves. I mentioned prioritization, but it’s one, bringing systems under management. In a lot of cases, what that also means is that for most systems associated with our large customers, it actually means taking them either off the internet directly, so we’re putting them behind a VPN or other sort of corporate device, or making sure that they are then known and then up-to-date because in a lot of cases, the real symptom of security problems that we find happens to be around the fact that an asset was just unmanaged for a very long time and may contain security vulnerabilities that were later discovered simply because you would have security patches that exist for known security issues that had not been applied.\nIn certain cases, such as zero-day attacks, it’s actually just much more important to know where all the assets are so you can patch them as soon as possible. But for the larger majority of assets that we discover for our customers and help manage their attack surface, the real problem is that the assets are just not known. And for executives, the real key is that the existing processes and tools that a lot of companies use can be very good from this certain side of security, but they assume that networks are effectively a lot more static.\nLaurel: So what are the ramifications of an enterprise not knowing their actual attack surface?\nMatt: The large, most obvious one is an increased risk of breach. I think it was an adage throughout a lot of the 2000s, helped on in no small part by vendors, that everything started from email phishing. And there’s very, very large email security vendors that still pumped this message that it’s every single security incident is effectively a phishing email and that humans are the weakest link when they’re clicking on things, and therefore buy more email security.\nI don’t think that’s wrong. I think it’s actually correct that security is a big thing, you can buy it. But it’s also much easier to mitigate especially now with a lot of good tools, like you actually have full visibility over all emails being sent to employees because they have to go through a central mail server. It’s actually a question of just being able to detect bad things but not actually needing to find out that there were, say, emails being sent that you didn’t have visibility into.\nI think in contrast, what we’ve seen, especially more recently over the last decade and really even the last five years, is some of the absolute worst breaches, the ones that cause hundreds of millions to billions of dollars damage, are not coming from phishing. They are actually coming from usually unknown and unmonitored assets and that in many cases, were actually on the public internet. So I think some of the largest examples of this are actually things like the WannaCry attack, which caused, it’s estimated over $10 billion worldwide in damage, shut down entire companies, putting most of the health-care system of the United Kingdom back on pen and paper for actual days.\nAnd the real ramifications are, you have all these extra avenues to get in because there are so many more assets that are online that are not being tracked by organizations, and that is actually how attackers are getting in because it turns out that there are very efficient, automated ways for attackers to understand and probe for and exploit these attacks surfaces. And the ramifications are quite bold. You see most of the healthcare of a first-world country reduced to pen and paper for days. Very, very serious because it’s not just hacking someone’s email, it’s actually hacking the critical infrastructure of the network itself.\nLaurel: Speaking of critical infrastructure, another recent attack is the water treatment plant in Florida, where an attacker was able to remotely change the chemical makeup of the water to add lye to it, which could have poisoned an entire community. So then, infrastructure is an enormous issue for very large companies, like water treatment plants or oil and gas companies, etc.?\nMatt: Absolutely. In that case, to the best of my understanding, the attack vector there was actually a remote access server that someone at that plant left open, was on the internet, and allowed someone to go in. What our tech services are about is we’re finding ways in that are effectively tools of IT convenience but that are able to be subverted by attackers because the tools of IT convenience are not hardened to the same degree as other things that are meant to be on the internet and are left out as a matter of course. We have this line that we like to view the internet in most ways as what most of us experienced through our web browsers or on our phone. It’s this really nice setup consumer experience and all of the webpages we view looks very nice and pleasing and we go there.\nAnd it’s a good analogy to the physical world like I guess, soon after we’re all vaccinated from covid-19, we’ll be back shopping outside. You might go to a Starbucks and the store is really nice, you have this great experience, you get your latte, you go out, but then if you look beneath all of the glitz on the streets, you actually have much older infrastructure. You have things like no sewer pipes and other things that are greasy and cracking. And that’s the infrastructure that supports the more beautiful world on top.\nA lot of what we see as part of attack surface is an IT analogy that most people view the internet really as just, “What’s in their web browser? What’s on the phone, these nice consumer websites?” But there’s entire backend IT infrastructure that supports that. And it’s somewhat creaky and it’s not always well-configured. Without something like ASM, you have problems that you don’t actually know the state of your network because it’s so large, distributed, and complex. And as in the case with Florida, which by the way was a smaller organization, it goes to the heart of how do you know that something is not going on? Under any IT security policy, having a remote access service on the internet should not be allowed. But it’s very hard even for smaller organizations to get that continuous visibility of, what do I actually look like from the outside? What do I look like to an attacker with legacy tools?\nLaurel: And that’s a good example of an attack that’s not a phishing attack. It has nothing to do with the email. While we’re on the discussion of attacks, most memorably this year again, SolarWinds and Exchange, how would implementing ASM have changed those outcomes for organizations? Or how about those lucky organizations that actually understood their attack surface management options and were able to find this and thwart the attack?\nMatt: I’ll speak to both because a number of our customers had both of those kinds of systems and we helped them respond. I think the Microsoft Exchange hacks, and for your listeners, a bit of background: there was actually a set of zero-days announced for the sets of versions of the Microsoft Exchange email services earlier in February and March of this year. Very, very dangerous because in effect, these are the mail servers of an organization and if you followed this XY chain, what it basically allowed you to do was send a message to a mail server to grant you effectively unfettered administrative access to the entire mail server. And there were actually hundreds of thousands of these that we detected online. And effectively, if you think about it, having an attacker being able to download all or most of the corporate mail server and with all of these sensitive information that’s stored there, is a very serious attack.\nSo what we noticed were actually two things, which was, for large organizations, they were very aware of this and they were patching very, very rapidly. But there were a number of customers that we were able to help where they’re so large that they actually don’t even have one central set of mail servers. So without Expanse, they wouldn’t have been able to find even all of their mail servers and be able to patch them in time because they are so distributed, they actually needed an inventory of even their mail servers. And it’s very hard to aggregate that in one central way unless you’re using an ASM tool like Expanse. Because instead, in a lot of cases, you’re usually using Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Excel. You’re going to be sending emails to different business units. You’re going to be asking IT leaders in those different business units. If they’re patched, they will be sending emails and spreadsheets back. It’s a very, very manual process.\nSo able to actually identify that and really help them in a very short order of, like, a day, find and be able to fix every single server they had on their estate, which we think really, really changed the outcome, because they could have been vulnerable for weeks in certain cases. For SolarWinds as well, I think the details are a bit different because not all SolarWinds assets are necessarily exposed to the internet. And also in a lot of cases, they’d been there for months. As part of broader Palo Alto, we had other products that were able to stop SolarWinds: the SolarWinds attack in particular, our endpoint framework called XDR. But even there for SolarWinds, once the attack was known, customers still have the problem of, they didn’t even know where all of their SolarWinds servers were, which again goes back to this inventory problem and choosing capabilities, both like Expanse and other capabilities we now have as part of Palo Alto, we were able to actually help customers very rapidly understand everywhere they had a SolarWinds exposure so that they could mitigate that very quickly. So there was effectively a two-step process. At Palo Alto, we were able to prevent the attack on our customers even without knowing that the supply chain had been breached. And then once it was more public, we were actually able to then also help everyone identify all of the servers that they had and make sure that they were all up to date and not infected with the supply-chain Trojan.\nLaurel: That’s really interesting because some companies may be thinking, “Oh, well, we don’t have water plants and aging infrastructure to worry about.” But do you actually know where all your mail is stored and how many different servers it may be on and different cloud instances or wherever? And when you do only have a matter of hours to make this critical patch, how quickly can you do it?\nMatt: Exactly. And a lot of the questions that I asked our customers are just, “How do you have confidence that, effectively, your systems are up to date?” Answering even seemingly basic sounding questions with existing IT, if you don’t have Expanse or ASM, is actually surprisingly hard. I’ll give another fun example. I ask chief information security officers this all the time: “How many routers does your organization have?” It seems like a pretty basic question, seems like they’d know, at least to a very good approximation, the IT team should probably know exactly how many routers they have. They’re very important pieces of networking equipment, especially at the enterprise level, they’re more expensive. So it’s not just like that home Wi-Fi hotspot that we’re used to. These things can cost tens, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars to handle enterprise-grade workloads.\nAnd what we find is that when you ask that question, there’s actually usually not one central place where all that’s tracked. Instead, it will be tracked by local development and IT teams in different ways. It will be tracked in multiple spreadsheets. There may be certain local IT management systems that know that, but at the end of it, if you said like, “How many routers do you have right now?” The process that they would use to answer that is not going into a system or logging in, it’s actually starting an email chain. That’s actually the one of the main problems that attack surface management attempts to solve, is, How do you have an accurate and up-to-date inventory of everything so that you can then build a variety of processes on top of that, including security? But if you don’t have an up-to-date inventory or you think you do, but you don’t, then when you start to pull on that thread, a lot of business processes, a lot of IT processes, a lot of security processes that you want to have apply across your entire enterprise, all of a sudden you’re realizing, “Wait, this actually is only being partially implemented because if I don’t have a full inventory, how do I actually know what’s going over all of my assets as opposed to just the assets I know about?” And that’s what we talk about when we say “unknown unknowns.” As you mentioned at the top, it’s, “I know some degree of my systems, but do I know all of them?” That delta can be everything for organizations because most of their risk is in the parts of their network they did not even know to investigate.\nLaurel: What other data-driven decisions can be made from this sort of focus on actually knowing where all your assets are. How else can this help the business?\nMatt: Two areas that this really helps organizations with is actually cloud governance and M&A. Particularly, these are very sprawling enterprises. So for a lot of our customers, they might actually have hundreds of different cloud accounts in the public cloud providers, so AWS, Azure, Oracle, Google, Alibaba in a lot of cases, and they had no way to actually rationalize this because they would have a whole bunch of different development teams and they couldn’t get something. And so, when they say that they are moving to the cloud, a typical refrain from our customers will be like, “Yes, we are. We have deals with Amazon and we’re hedging our bets a little bit. We’re also exploring Azure so we’re not solely locked into one cloud.” What we find is that the average customer for Expanse is in 11 different infrastructure providers.\nI’m not talking SaaS, I’m talking in places that you actually get like renting a server, putting data on yourself. It’s amazing and astronomical and we could say, “Well, yeah, you are on Azure. You’re also on AWS. Did you know that you’re also in DigitalOcean? You’re also in Linode. Your general manager in Europe probably put you in OVH or Orange hosting. You have something else in the Malaysian data center. I’m not exactly sure what that is.” And that’s typical. One customer for us was actually in over a hundred different providers because they’re a very large multinational. I think that’s when we see that people’s cloud governance plans versus cloud reality are dramatically different. And helping them with that will enable them to move both securely and quickly to the cloud.\nSecond one is mergers and acquisitions. I think this is something that is increasingly happening. As a lot of industries are consolidating, there’s a lot of M&A activity more recently. But when you think about it, an M&A is one of the largest IT change events an organization can have, especially if it’s a large acquisition. So I know a little bit about this, having recently gone through this process with Palo Alto Networks on ourselves on the other side of the table, but the number of things you have to integrate is quite large. And in the case of Expanse, we’re integrated with a top security company in the world and also we are relatively small. So the integration headaches have been almost nonexistent, and it’s been a really great process.\nBut for larger organizations where you might, an organization with 50,000 people is acquiring an organization with 10,000 people, the number of different steps you have to go through, the amount of IT that you have to transfer, the amount of legacy that you have to understand is gigantic. And in a lot of ways, these are in many cases only partially implemented because as an acquirer, you might not even know where all the assets you’re acquiring are. As an example, for an airline, there was a series of mergers and we’re actually able to find assets of the merged airline that no longer exists, but were still on the internet more than a decade after the merger.\nWhich gives you an idea of just how long some of these things take. That’s the other side of, how we really help with our customers, is actually understanding, “When you actually acquire an asset, how do you actually complete that process? How do you measure it? How do you monitor it and how do you do that at the scale of the internet rather than with a lot of consultants, Excel spreadsheets, pieces of paper and emails?”\nLaurel: So from our conversation today, I feel like this is the, “If you don’t know what you don’t know, you should really figure it out” warning, if you haven’t heard it before. But there are glimmers of hope in this, right? Because if the asset exists, you can at least find it, track it and assess what you’re going to do with it, mediate any changes you need to make or assess it to bring it back to full cybersecurity compliance. What gives you hope about what’s possible after seeing the first three months of this year and what’s happened with attacks, the ongoing issues that we’re going to have? But there is opportunity there, right? There is hope. What are you seeing that makes you optimistic about cybersecurity and what we’re looking forward to in the next five years?\nMatt: Yeah, I’m actually quite optimistic in not even the long-term but even in the medium term I think, even three, four years out. Near-term, definitely there’s going to be some rough seas ahead, but here’s what makes me most optimistic. One, I think that this is actually a solvable problem largely with a lot of technology that’s being developed. And by that, it is clear that once you know a problem exists, actually fixing it is actually rather straightforward. There’s a lot of mechanistic steps to get better at that. There’s a lot of automations that can be put on that. And there’s a lot of things coming to bear. But in many cases, the actual hard part is seeing what you actually need to fix and knowing all of the set of problems and then being able to prioritize them effectively and then start working on them.\nAnd I think in particular, the things that I’ve seen are within the industry, I think there are a lot of technologies in the few years that are going to meet the marketing hype that has been around for years. I talk a lot with industry partners. We use substantial amounts of data. With my background where I have a PhD from Stanford in operations research and machine learning, we actually do use some real actual machine learning in our products. We also use a lot of heuristics as well. I joke that we sometimes have machine learning classifiers to solve a problem. Other times we have SQL queries that solve the problem.\nWe have some really well-written SQL queries. I’m very proud of those. But I think that the industry itself, especially in marketing material, you would think that everything in cybersecurity is this automated AI, ML-enabled everything. In most cases, but not all, but in a lot across the industry, and this is especially true in startups, it’s just a line to pitch. And what companies really call AI are just standard software rules and there’s really nothing special going on.\nOr there’s an old joke that, “Oh, I have this great AI thing. What is it? Well, we have a bunch of analysts that are former intelligence officers, usually in Maryland or outside of Tel Aviv and they’re the ones doing everything. But we have a system that efficiently routes work to them and that’s our AI.” And they’re like, “Wait, that’s people.” I think what I’ve seen is that one, automation broadly defined is a real thing. But automation actually means on the ground, is you take something that previously took hours and days and 10 people. And then with software right now, it’s more so how do you take that down to 15 minutes and two or three people?\nI think that we’re going to see even larger gains or even start to take humans out of the loop entirely in certain business processes. And I think what we’re seeing and this is a lot of what we’re working on and I’m working on now is that over the next months and years, actual large-scale machine learning capability is actually being deployed in production. I think there are some that are out there in piecemeal. There’s a lot more rules than anyone wants to talk about, but we are now seeing there’s enough assemblage of data, there’s enough normalization of data in that, especially at the larger companies, and that enterprises are more willing to share information with vendors if it demonstrably improves the security service that they are getting, that we are actually going to be able to deploy increasingly sophisticated capabilities along those lines and have the product/reality match. I think that’s what at least the broader industry marketing zeitgeist had been.\nI’ve seen a lot of them, they are very, very real and they’re very much coming. And they’re coming at an industrial scale for defenders. And I think that’s what I’m most excited about because despite the fact that there’s the old adage of, attackers need to be right once, defenders need to be right all the time, increasingly, it is now more scalable for defenders to be right much of the time and to actually set up very vast monitoring networks so that if the attackers slip up once, the defenders can completely wipe them out in that attack. And that both asymmetrically affects cost and also I think will help tilt the field back to defense.\nMatt: I think when you had partial AI solutions and ML solutions and partial automation, it helped attackers much more because they could duct-tape together a few different parts, scale up certain things very highly and then just see what came back to them in a great way. I think defenders are going to be able to have similar capabilities that are effective because they actually cover everything going on in an enterprise. And that’s going to allow us to turn the tide.\nLaurel:Matt, thank you so much for joining us today in what has been a fantastic conversation on the Business Lab.\nThat was Matt Kraning, the chief technology officer and co-founder of Expanse, who I spoke with from Cambridge, Massachusetts, the home of MIT and MIT Technology Review, overlooking the Charles River.\nThat’s it for this episode of Business Lab.

Its goal is to remove 1 billion tons of the main greenhouse gas fueling climate change by 2035.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The San Francisco–based company will announce on May 26 that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from major investors&nbsp;including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prelude Ventures. (Industry sources say it’s in the millions.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the payment processing company Stripe, which has been funding demonstration projects in this space, will announce that it plans to purchase nearly 250 tons of carbon removal from the company at $2,054 per ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noah Deich, president of Carbon180, a research firm that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon, says the company could help address a core challenge in carbon removal: technical approaches like those offered by direct-air-capture companies such as Climeworks and Carbon Engineering promise permanent results but cost a lot, while natural solutions like soil and forest offsets are cheap but often <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/29/1017811/california-climate-policy-carbon-credits-cause-co2-pollution/\">raise concerns</a> about how reliable and durable the carbon removal is. If Heirloom hits its cost targets, it could offer permanent removal at relatively affordable prices, Deich says. (Heirloom’s CEO, Shashank Samala, took part in Carbon180’s entrepreneur-in-residence fellowship program.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the technology is at an early stage and the company will face numerous technical and market challenges along the way, including finding more buyers—like Stripe—willing to pay high prices for carbon removal for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A novel approach to carbon removal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The venture is earning attention in part because the process, described in a paper published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16510-3\">Nature Communications</a> last year, was developed by prominent researchers exploring the use of minerals to capture and store carbon. Those include: Peter Kelemen of Columbia University, Greg Dipple at the University of British Columbia, Phil Renforth of Heriot-Watt University and Jennifer Wilcox, who is now principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy in the Biden administration. The lead author of the paper was Noah McQueen, a graduate student of Wilcox’s and now head of research at Heirloom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preventing the planet from warming by 2 ˚C could require pulling 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050 and 20 billion annually by 2100, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/resource/25259/Negative%20Emissions%20Technologies.pdf\">2018 study</a>. But only a handful of mostly early-stage startups are actively working on this today, exploring a variety of means like <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/02/27/136958/one-mans-two-decade-quest-to-suck-greenhouse-gas-out-of-the-sky/\">creating machines</a> that directly grab carbon dioxide molecules out of the air, <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/lucky-charm/\">converting biowaste into oil</a> that is injected underground, or developing systems to incentivize or validate natural approaches like reforestation or agricultural practices that may take up more carbon in soils.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of scientists and nonprofits have also researched the possibility of accelerating the processes by which various minerals—particularly those rich in silicate, calcium, and magnesium—pull carbon dioxide out of air or rainwater. Some are grinding up and spreading out materials <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/22/1004218/how-green-sand-could-capture-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-dioxide/\">like olivine</a>, while others are putting to use the already pulverized by-products of mining operations, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/06/1009374/asbestos-could-be-a-powerful-weapon-against-climate-change-you-read-that-right/\">even including asbestos</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom is taking a very different route, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The company will cook materials such as ground limestone, which is mostly calcium tied up with carbon dioxide, at temperatures of 400 to 900 ˚C—high enough for it to break down and release the greenhouse gas. This is similar to the first step in producing cement. (It could use other feedstocks as well, such as magnesite, which was the focus of the Nature Communications paper.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom eventually intends to rely on electricity-driven kilns. That means the process can run on clean renewable energy sources and would produce a stream of carbon dioxide free from fossil-fuel impurities. That carbon dioxide can then be relatively easily captured, compressed, and injected underground, storing it away basically forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leftover oxide minerals, which would be calcium oxide if the process starts with limestone, can be spread out in thin layers across sheets, stacked vertically, and exposed to the open air. Think lunch trays on cafeteria racks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The minerals are highly reactive, eager to bond with carbon dioxide in the air. With some additional enhancements, the company’s researchers believe, most of the materials will bond with the greenhouse gas in as little as two weeks. Normally it would take around a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The startup won’t discuss the enhancements, but they might include automated ways of mixing the materials to continually expose them to open air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That process would convert calcium oxide back into calcium carbonate, the main component of limestone, at which point the process can simply begin again. The company believes it can reuse the materials at least 10 times, possibly dozens, before they degrade too much to capture enough carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scaling carbon removal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this is very expensive today, as reflected in the price Stripe is paying. The payments company will announce on Wednesday that it will spend nearly $2.8 million to purchase carbon removal credits from six projects, plus another $5.25 million when (or if) those efforts complete certain milestones. The other recipients include <a href=\"https://www.carbonbuilt.com/\">CarbonBuilt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.runningtide.com/\">Running Tide</a>, Seachange, Mission Zero, and the Future Forest Company, which is planning a mineral-weathering field trial that involves spreading basalt rock along a forest floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom’s Samala says these early, high-priced purchases are crucial for helping emerging carbon removal companies scale up and cut costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Deployment is what makes this cheaper, unleashes new markets, and drives down costs further,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But finding more buyers willing to bear such costs is going to be a serious challenge for all carbon removal companies—particularly given the availability of cheap forest and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/03/1002484/why-we-cant-count-on-carbon-sucking-farms-to-slow-climate-change/\">soil offsets</a> that allow buyers to claim they’re balancing out their emissions, whether or not such programs are <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/02/1011500/amazon-forestry-offsets-net-zero-carbon-climate-change/\">reliable</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the world needs to provide support for many more carbon removal research groups and startups, says Nan Ransohoff, head of climate at Stripe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to “radically increase the number of projects” if we want to have “any shot” of hitting those 2050 carbon removal targets, Ransohoff says. “Ten gigatons is a lot—it’s just a massive number, and even in the best scenario, all the companies we have today aren’t going to get us there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Driving down costs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom is confident it can drive down the costs significantly because it’s avoiding expensive sorbents and the energy-intensive fans that blow air through the system in other approaches to direct air capture. In addition, it intends to rely heavily on robots, software, and other forms of automation to speed up and slash the costs of the process, drawing on Samala’s earlier experience as the cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.tempoautomation.com/\">Tempo Automation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom will be leveraging several other advances under way as well, including improvements in electricity-driven heat technology, the declining costs of renewable energy, and the increasingly decarbonized grids across the world, says Clea Kolster, director of science at Lowercarbon Capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their ultimate costs and ability to rapidly scale up will depend a lot on how much and how quickly those things continue to improve. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it stands, generating the necessary temperatures from electricity with today’s technologies can be 5 to 10 times as expensive as directly burning coal or natural gas, says Addison Stark, director of the energy and environment program at advisory firm Clark Street Associates, who coauthored <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/joule/pdf/S2542-4351(20)30575-4.pdf\">a recent paper in Joule</a> on the topic. In addition, if the source of the electricity itself isn’t carbon-free, it undermines any carbon removal benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another question is how much and how reliably Heirloom will be able to cut down the time it takes for the oxides to bond with carbon dioxide, which will dramatically affect the economics, says Jeremy Freeman, executive director at CarbonPlan, which analyzes the scientific integrity of carbon removal efforts and helped evaluate the projects that applied for Stripe’s program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heirloom will also have to raise a far larger round of funding to eventually build a demonstration plant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company’s main business model will be selling carbon removal credits to corporations or individuals, through either voluntary offset systems or government-based carbon programs.

AI technology in education develops your learning method properly. It supports teachers or coaches to implement better, acquainted, and customized help to students.</p><p>AI-powered learning techniques help teachers to examine the grasping power of learners. It differs from one student to another. Students learn the theory at varied rates. The knowledge and reasoning capabilities of each student are different.</p><p>Artificial intelligence-based education apps are fulfilling an essential role in developing the process of education and preparation methods. AI in education benefits students obtaining the course materials and listening to the subject demo anytime from anywhere. Thanks to the latest AI technology, we can do everything at our fingertips.</p><p>Here are the advantages of AI in the Education Sector:</p><h3>Lessening Workload for Educators and Learners</h3><p>One of the significant benefits of choosing artificial intelligence consulting help is that the AI-powered methods and processes can decrease the workload for educators and give them enough time to concentrate on making learning better. We have previously explained how automating organizational businesses can lower down the activity of the office team. The same approach is implemented to students as well. Students can build programs that allow them to operate at their pace.</p><p>They don’t demand to feel overwhelmed about creating various tasks for the corresponding day. It enables everyone connected to move efficiently and give their best chance. The necessity to get at the same speed as other scholars was also excluded. It provides students more courage to learn even those subjects they are ordinarily frightened of.</p><h3>Any Students Can Learn Globally</h3><p>Online programs have made it possible for students from any country to attend the course from any other nation. The physical boundaries between nations are no longer there in terms of online education. Technology made it likely to obtain functional abilities from the best teachers, no circumstance where they are placed.</p><p>Presently, students have even better possibilities of renewing their abilities into AI-powered coaching sittings. Information Technology is one area where various fields are utilizing AI. That shouldn’t be shocking since artificial intelligence is an inherent part of the industry. Students and professionals who wish to become AI and ML specialists are registering in these programs.</p><h3>Creating Good Content</h3><p>Good content is a trendy topic in the education industry. It is nothing but generating virtual content by digitizing notes, textbooks, producing video education and addresses, explaining interactive coaching sessions, and more. Artificial intelligence in education benefits plans with customizable interfaces for the students to learn quickly and experience better. Be it the basic level or the high level; good content can be generated for any material and any class.</p><p>Microlearning and experience mapping are ideas that apply to this section. Professions mapping is the method of building a visual description of the facilities required by students to do well in their education.</p><h3>Automating Regulatory Duties</h3><p>Is there an institution that can work without backend work by the executive committee and the education department? Whether it is listing paperwork, forwarding emails and information, reaching learners and their progenitors, or obtaining reports, the official staff continually manages every day.</p><p>Furthermore, the professors and educators have to check the homework, test essays, find a teaching plan, plan for the following sessions, etc. The remaining time is given to identifying test sheets, preparing scheduled lessons, and making the regulatory effort.

AI technology in education develops your learning method properly. It supports teachers or coaches to implement better, acquainted, and customized help to students.\nAI-powered learning techniques help teachers to examine the grasping power of learners. It differs from one student to another. Students learn the theory at varied rates. The knowledge and reasoning capabilities of each student are different.\nArtificial intelligence-based education apps are fulfilling an essential role in developing the process of education and preparation methods. AI in education benefits students obtaining the course materials and listening to the subject demo anytime from anywhere. Thanks to the latest AI technology, we can do everything at our fingertips.\nHere are the advantages of AI in the Education Sector:\nLessening Workload for Educators and Learners\nOne of the significant benefits of choosing artificial intelligence consulting help is that the AI-powered methods and processes can decrease the workload for educators and give them enough time to concentrate on making learning better. We have previously explained how automating organizational businesses can lower down the activity of the office team. The same approach is implemented to students as well. Students can build programs that allow them to operate at their pace.\nThey don’t demand to feel overwhelmed about creating various tasks for the corresponding day. It enables everyone connected to move efficiently and give their best chance. The necessity to get at the same speed as other scholars was also excluded. It provides students more courage to learn even those subjects they are ordinarily frightened of.\nAny Students Can Learn Globally\nOnline programs have made it possible for students from any country to attend the course from any other nation. The physical boundaries between nations are no longer there in terms of online education. Technology made it likely to obtain functional abilities from the best teachers, no circumstance where they are placed.\nPresently, students have even better possibilities of renewing their abilities into AI-powered coaching sittings. Information Technology is one area where various fields are utilizing AI. That shouldn’t be shocking since artificial intelligence is an inherent part of the industry. Students and professionals who wish to become AI and ML specialists are registering in these programs.\nCreating Good Content\nGood content is a trendy topic in the education industry. It is nothing but generating virtual content by digitizing notes, textbooks, producing video education and addresses, explaining interactive coaching sessions, and more. Artificial intelligence in education benefits plans with customizable interfaces for the students to learn quickly and experience better. Be it the basic level or the high level; good content can be generated for any material and any class.\nMicrolearning and experience mapping are ideas that apply to this section. Professions mapping is the method of building a visual description of the facilities required by students to do well in their education.\nAutomating Regulatory Duties\nIs there an institution that can work without backend work by the executive committee and the education department? Whether it is listing paperwork, forwarding emails and information, reaching learners and their progenitors, or obtaining reports, the official staff continually manages every day.\nFurthermore, the professors and educators have to check the homework, test essays, find a teaching plan, plan for the following sessions, etc. The remaining time is given to identifying test sheets, preparing scheduled lessons, and making the regulatory effort. The artificial intelligence expert will assist you to build an AI system that will provide the team and the coaches with more potency at work. Educators can use smart question generators to support them, produce better question papers for the examinations and save time in the method.\nKnowledge Made Manageable for People with Special Requirements\nCreating a learning program for people with special needs was never easy. Though there are private schools for learners with speech, hearing, and visual impairment, the instruction method could have been more powerful.\nAlso, students with dyslexia, autism, ADHD, and others, have to be entered into different schools to help them deal entirely. But why can’t these scholars continue to be members of regular schools? Is there a way educators can learn and give more attention to these children? Artificial intelligence is making it achievable for children with special needs to study most conveniently.\nPersonalizing Training for Students\nPersonalized education is quite much related to personalized suggestions submitted by online marketplaces.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday, May 21, with the intention of staying just a few days—more than enough time, he hoped, to get a dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex had been thinking about how to get vaccinated for weeks. Kenya has <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/kenya/\">received only enough donated doses to vaccinate roughly 1% of its population, and while he would be eligible in the United Kingdom, getting shots there would be</a> very complicated: a 14-day quarantine in a designated hotel upon arrival, registration with a local doctor, another 14-day quarantine upon his return to Kenya, and then likely a repeat of the whole process three or four months later for a second shot, since the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine has not yet been approved in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US, on the other hand, has no quarantine requirements and its <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/22/1021079/united-states-covid19-vaccine-surplus-not-enough-people/\">vaccine supply has outstripped demand since April</a>. After hearing first that a British couple he was friends with had successfully gotten their shot in Colorado, and then that New York City had plans to vaccinate travelers at popular tourist sites, Alex applied for his visa and booked his flight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He doesn’t feel great about it, though. The past few years of US politics have left the country low on his list of places to visit, and it doesn’t make sense to him that he has to travel for a vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a bit of a joke, really,” he told me before his trip. “Is it really better to fly loads of people to New York to do this than to just fly some vaccines from New York to places where vaccines are needed?”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Opportunity for some</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost as soon as the world’s first covid-19 vaccine became available, there were reports of people working the system to get the shot ahead of their turn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, some paid upwards of £40,000 ($56,000) to fly to the United Arab Emirates on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/03/chinas-sinopharm-vaccine-offered-to-elite-few-in-uae-tourist-deal\">luxury vaccine vacations</a>. In the US, some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/us/covid-vaccines-crossing-states.html\">traveled across state lines</a> to take advantage of more permissive eligibility criteria in neighboring states. Others just drove from wealthier neighborhoods to poorer ones, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-22/vaccine-access-codes-for-hard-hit-communities-of-color-circulate-widely-in-affluent-l-a\">armed with access codes</a> meant to help immunize more people from marginalized communities heavily affected by the disease. This wasn’t always called vaccine tourism, but it drew outrage, and no small amount of envy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the vaccines have become more widely available in wealthy nations, the profile of vaccine tourists has also begun to shift—and so have government responses. A small but increasing number of places even see this travel as a way to help restart local economies stalled by the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case with New York City.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early-May, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a proposal to <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-should-offer-covid-shots-tourists-popular-sites-de-blasio-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">offer visitors the J&amp;J vaccine at popular tourist sites </a>such as Central Park and Times Square. “Come here; it’s safe,” he said in a press conference. New York is “a great place to be,” he added, “and we’re going to take care of you. We’re going to make sure you get vaccinated while you’re here with us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That plan is currently pending approval from the state health department, but if Alex is any indication, de Blasio’s message to tourists is already working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just New York. Twenty-four states currently <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/populations-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">do not require residency for vaccines</a>; 25 more offer the shot to both residents and nonresident workers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have become destinations for foreign vaccine tourists. There are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-tv-host-juan-jose-origel-got-coronavirus-vaccine-miami-2021-1\">reports of Mexican celebrities flying into Miami</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/04/21/wealthy-latin-americans-flock-to-us-in-search-of-vaccines/\">Peruvian presidential candidate</a> getting vaccinated in Texas, and <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/7822715/covid-canadians-vaccinated-us/\">Canadians seeking vaccines in American pharmacies</a> just south of the border. At one point, the state of Florida became so concerned about foreign visitors taking advantage of its vaccine availability that it began requiring <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article248671090.html\">proof of residency</a> at vaccination sites. (Florida <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/04/30/florida-eases-vaccine-residency-requirement-paving-way-for-migrants/\">ended the residency requirement  in late April</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other states and territories have been more direct in tying vaccine tourism to their own economic recovery efforts. Alaska will begin offering the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to visitors upon arrival at four airports on June 1, and the US Virgin Islands, while not explicitly marketing themselves as a vaccine tourism destination, have seen the benefits nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This checks a lot of boxes for us,” tourism commissioner Joseph Boschulte told <a href=\"https://www.travelweekly.com/Caribbean-Travel/Insights/USVI-rolls-out-the-welcome-mat-for-vaccine-tourism\">Travel Weekly</a> in April. “Our economy benefits from those who stay several weeks, eat in our restaurants, stay at hotels, charter boats for day trips, and shop while waiting for the second shot. The airlines get the passengers who return a second time, and our visitor numbers increase. Our airlift right now is ahead of both the pre-pandemic lift and the pre-2017 hurricane flight operations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>“A huge disconnect”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the positive vaccine outlook in the United States, global vaccine distribution remains highly inequitable. According to one estimate by the Economist Intelligence Unit, <a href=\"https://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/\">85 low-income countries will not have enough access to vaccines to cover 60% to 70% of the population until 2023</a>. In the US, meanwhile, the Biden administration has set the arbitrary but symbolic deadline of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-government-and-politics-d6ee06383f123a4ef0941847200757df\">reaching 70% of the population with at least one shot </a>by July 4.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s a huge disconnect growing where in some countries with the highest vaccination rates, there appears to be a mindset that the pandemic is over, while others are experiencing huge waves of infection,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a mid-May briefing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that vaccine gap is growing. COVAX, an international initiative to distribute covid-19 vaccines equitably, had<a href=\"https://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/\"> secured commitments from manufacturers and wealthier donor nations for 2 billion doses to deliver to low-income countries by 2021</a>. But the situation on the ground lags far behind those commitments: by the end of May, COVAX will have <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covax-facility-will-deliver-its-65-millionth-vaccine-dose-week-it-shouldve-been\">distributed only 65 million doses</a>, far fewer even than its intended May goal of 170 million, and Unicef predicts that the initiative will have a shortfall of 190 million doses by the end of June. This is due primarily to production and distribution delays in India, a global vaccine production hub in the midst of a devastating second covid wave that has left at least 23 million infected and 250,000 dead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A few days after Tedros’s press conference, in response to mounting international pressure, the Biden administration pledged 20 million doses from its stash of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines to COVAX. This represented a significant shift in policy: it was the first time the US was donating doses that could have been used domestically. (The administration has also committed to donate 60 million doses of AstraZeneca to COVAX but has yet to do so.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glenn Cohen, a law professor who directs Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, says that the pledge of 20 million doses is “a good first step” for a country that cannot get enough of its own people to use up its vaccine supply quickly enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, he adds, it does not negate the ethical murkiness<em> </em>of having American cities and states offer, or consider offering, vaccines to visitors as official policy. Cohen, who has written a book on medical tourism, says vaccines were meant to go first to “those who are most in need” and not to “people who are able to travel, who have visas, who are able-bodied.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it another way, he says: it’s as if “someone loans you their car to take your mother to the hospital, and then you decide to take that car and instead of giving it back to the person—or taking other people to the hospital—you run it as an Uber.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Outsourcing ethical quandaries&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Amler, the dean of New York Medical College’s school of health science and practice, says that encouraging travelers to fly to the United States from places with low vaccination rates—and potentially higher levels of infection—may itself be bad for public health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any risk of ‘importing’ covid infections will depend on the volume of incoming travelers and the percent of travelers arriving who already have covid infection,” says Amler, a former chief medical officer at the CDC. “We also can’t predict with certitude the city’s ability to manage their numbers if they become excessive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To combat this danger, some people who are traveling to get vaccinated are taking their own precautions to avoid becoming unwitting vectors for the virus—or causing other kinds of harm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Michael” (also a pseudonym) and his wife flew from Quito, Ecuador, to New Orleans for a five-day trip in mid-May, during which he received the J&amp;J shot and she got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael’s family in Canada have yet to meet the couple’s twin boys, who were born in January 2020. By going to Louisiana for their shots, he estimates that they’ve sped up their vaccination status—and therefore their family reunion—by six to nine months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the couple wanted to make sure they were not taking vaccines that could have gone to someone else. “Our first thought was to go to a red state, because we knew supply outstripped demand,” he explains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They took extra precautions before and during their trip, too.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday, May 21, with the intention of staying just a few days—more than enough time, he hoped, to get a dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. \nAlex had been thinking about how to get vaccinated for weeks. Kenya has received only enough donated doses to vaccinate roughly 1% of its population, and while he would be eligible in the United Kingdom, getting shots there would be very complicated: a 14-day quarantine in a designated hotel upon arrival, registration with a local doctor, another 14-day quarantine upon his return to Kenya, and then likely a repeat of the whole process three or four months later for a second shot, since the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine has not yet been approved in the UK. \nThe US, on the other hand, has no quarantine requirements and its vaccine supply has outstripped demand since April. After hearing first that a British couple he was friends with had successfully gotten their shot in Colorado, and then that New York City had plans to vaccinate travelers at popular tourist sites, Alex applied for his visa and booked his flight. \nHe doesn’t feel great about it, though. The past few years of US politics have left the country low on his list of places to visit, and it doesn’t make sense to him that he has to travel for a vaccine. \n“It’s a bit of a joke, really,” he told me before his trip. “Is it really better to fly loads of people to New York to do this than to just fly some vaccines from New York to places where vaccines are needed?”\nOpportunity for some\nAlmost as soon as the world’s first covid-19 vaccine became available, there were reports of people working the system to get the shot ahead of their turn. \nIn the UK, some paid upwards of £40,000 ($56,000) to fly to the United Arab Emirates on luxury vaccine vacations. In the US, some traveled across state lines to take advantage of more permissive eligibility criteria in neighboring states. Others just drove from wealthier neighborhoods to poorer ones, armed with access codes meant to help immunize more people from marginalized communities heavily affected by the disease. This wasn’t always called vaccine tourism, but it drew outrage, and no small amount of envy.\nBut as the vaccines have become more widely available in wealthy nations, the profile of vaccine tourists has also begun to shift—and so have government responses. A small but increasing number of places even see this travel as a way to help restart local economies stalled by the pandemic.\nSuch is the case with New York City. \nIn early-May, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a proposal to offer visitors the J&J vaccine at popular tourist sites such as Central Park and Times Square. “Come here; it’s safe,” he said in a press conference. New York is “a great place to be,” he added, “and we’re going to take care of you. We’re going to make sure you get vaccinated while you’re here with us.”\nThat plan is currently pending approval from the state health department, but if Alex is any indication, de Blasio’s message to tourists is already working. \nAnd it’s not just New York. Twenty-four states currently do not require residency for vaccines; 25 more offer the shot to both residents and nonresident workers. \nMany have become destinations for foreign vaccine tourists. There are reports of Mexican celebrities flying into Miami, a Peruvian presidential candidate getting vaccinated in Texas, and Canadians seeking vaccines in American pharmacies just south of the border. At one point, the state of Florida became so concerned about foreign visitors taking advantage of its vaccine availability that it began requiring proof of residency at vaccination sites. (Florida ended the residency requirement  in late April.)\nOther states and territories have been more direct in tying vaccine tourism to their own economic recovery efforts. Alaska will begin offering the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to visitors upon arrival at four airports on June 1, and the US Virgin Islands, while not explicitly marketing themselves as a vaccine tourism destination, have seen the benefits nonetheless.\n“This checks a lot of boxes for us,” tourism commissioner Joseph Boschulte told Travel Weekly in April. “Our economy benefits from those who stay several weeks, eat in our restaurants, stay at hotels, charter boats for day trips, and shop while waiting for the second shot. The airlines get the passengers who return a second time, and our visitor numbers increase. Our airlift right now is ahead of both the pre-pandemic lift and the pre-2017 hurricane flight operations.”\n“A huge disconnect”\nDespite the positive vaccine outlook in the United States, global vaccine distribution remains highly inequitable. According to one estimate by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 85 low-income countries will not have enough access to vaccines to cover 60% to 70% of the population until 2023. In the US, meanwhile, the Biden administration has set the arbitrary but symbolic deadline of reaching 70% of the population with at least one shot by July 4. \n“There’s a huge disconnect growing where in some countries with the highest vaccination rates, there appears to be a mindset that the pandemic is over, while others are experiencing huge waves of infection,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a mid-May briefing. \nAnd that vaccine gap is growing. COVAX, an international initiative to distribute covid-19 vaccines equitably, had secured commitments from manufacturers and wealthier donor nations for 2 billion doses to deliver to low-income countries by 2021. But the situation on the ground lags far behind those commitments: by the end of May, COVAX will have distributed only 65 million doses, far fewer even than its intended May goal of 170 million, and Unicef predicts that the initiative will have a shortfall of 190 million doses by the end of June. This is due primarily to production and distribution delays in India, a global vaccine production hub in the midst of a devastating second covid wave that has left at least 23 million infected and 250,000 dead.\nA few days after Tedros’s press conference, in response to mounting international pressure, the Biden administration pledged 20 million doses from its stash of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to COVAX. This represented a significant shift in policy: it was the first time the US was donating doses that could have been used domestically. (The administration has also committed to donate 60 million doses of AstraZeneca to COVAX but has yet to do so.) \nGlenn Cohen, a law professor who directs Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, says that the pledge of 20 million doses is “a good first step” for a country that cannot get enough of its own people to use up its vaccine supply quickly enough. \nBut, he adds, it does not negate the ethical murkiness of having American cities and states offer, or consider offering, vaccines to visitors as official policy. Cohen, who has written a book on medical tourism, says vaccines were meant to go first to “those who are most in need” and not to “people who are able to travel, who have visas, who are able-bodied.”\nTo put it another way, he says: it’s as if “someone loans you their car to take your mother to the hospital, and then you decide to take that car and instead of giving it back to the person—or taking other people to the hospital—you run it as an Uber.”\nOutsourcing ethical quandaries \nRobert Amler, the dean of New York Medical College’s school of health science and practice, says that encouraging travelers to fly to the United States from places with low vaccination rates—and potentially higher levels of infection—may itself be bad for public health.\n“Any risk of ‘importing’ covid infections will depend on the volume of incoming travelers and the percent of travelers arriving who already have covid infection,” says Amler, a former chief medical officer at the CDC. “We also can’t predict with certitude the city’s ability to manage their numbers if they become excessive.”\nTo combat this danger, some people who are traveling to get vaccinated are taking their own precautions to avoid becoming unwitting vectors for the virus—or causing other kinds of harm. \n“Michael” (also a pseudonym) and his wife flew from Quito, Ecuador, to New Orleans for a five-day trip in mid-May, during which he received the J&J shot and she got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.\nMichael’s family in Canada have yet to meet the couple’s twin boys, who were born in January 2020. By going to Louisiana for their shots, he estimates that they’ve sped up their vaccination status—and therefore their family reunion—by six to nine months. \nStill, the couple wanted to make sure they were not taking vaccines that could have gone to someone else. “Our first thought was to go to a red state, because we knew supply outstripped demand,” he explains. \nThey took extra precautions before and during their trip, too. Having both contracted covid much earlier in the pandemic, they got antibody tests before flying. Then they kept to themselves to limit their exposure. \n\n“The question is really about what states are doing with their resources and which countries are continuing to use them [vaccines] for their own advantage. Globally, that’s really wrong.”\nNicole Hassoun, Binghamton University\n\n\n\n\nBy taking the initiative, they may have dampened the potential negative impact from their trip, but this highlights another problem of vaccine tourism as policy—and of much of the world’s covid-19 response in general. Difficult ethical decisions that could have—or, some argue, should have—been matters of policy are instead being pushed onto individuals. \n“The city is the one who sets the queue,” says Pamela Hieronymi, a philosopher at the University of California, Los Angeles. So if you have an issue with vaccine tourists in, say, New York, “it seems your complaint should be made to the city, not to the person using the line offered to them.”\nNicole Hassoun, a philosophy professor at Binghamton University and the head of its Global Health Impact Project, also argues that while vaccine tourists may grapple with their choice, the real ethical issue is not at the individual level. “I think the question is really about what states are doing with their resources and which countries are continuing to use them [vaccines] for their own advantage,” she says. “Globally, that’s really wrong.”\nThere may also be second-order effects like exacerbating local inequality, says Yadurshini Raveendran, a graduate of the Duke Global Health Institute, who points out that richer individuals in low-income countries—those who travel internationally and are thus more likely to take advantage of vaccine tourism—already have better access to health care than poorer people in those countries. Israel has the highest vaccination rates in the world, she notes, but Palestine has administered one dose to just 5% of the population. \nMichael, who runs a marketing business in Quito, wants his employees to have the same options he did. “I’ve been thinking about giving my employees a mid-year bonus to fly to the States to get vaccinated if they want,” he says. For those who do not already have US travel documents, however, waiting for a visa appointment may take longer than waiting for a vaccine.\nReally, it should come back to public health, says Amler, of New York Medical College. Traveling for the vaccine “may well be effective for the individuals who get jabbed,” he says. “However, the much more efficient approach is to ship vaccine to other countries, where their people can be vaccinated in greater numbers and without the inconvenience, expense, and inequitable impact of personal international travel.”\n“Vaccine buffet”\nOn Saturday, Alex made his way to the Javits Center, the gleaming glass conference center on Manhattan’s west side that has been converted first into a covid field hospital and then into a mass vaccination site. \nThere, presented with the choice of Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines, he stuck to his plan of the single J&J shot—though he briefly considered whether to supplement either of the shots at Javits with a Pfizer dose later, in the UK. “Vaccine buffet,” he joked. \n“It was the most impressive health-care experience I have known,” he told me before catching his flight out. It was efficient—he was vaccinated in less than five minutes—and seemed genuinely committed to serving people equitably. \n“When you see something that fancy… run extremely well, courteously, not with any of the bleakness or contempt sometimes at play with… free public services,” he said, it is “amazing to see.”\nHis goal accomplished, Alex spent the rest of his weekend biking around the city and enjoying its famous cuisine, eating outdoors. He avoided bars and clubs, “despite how much fun it looked,” he said. “Maybe if I come back once the vaccine has activated.” \nAnd despite his expressed dislike of the United States before his vaccine vacation, he’s now thinking about coming back. “This vaccine thing has shown me that America does have a side to it that cares about basic public health,” he said. “More than that, once it mobilizes its resources, what it can actually achieve is astounding.”\nThis story is part of the Pandemic Technology Project, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.","dc:creator":"Eileen Guo","content":"Like many vaccine tourists, “Alex” doesn’t want you to know his real name.&#160; The British expat arrived on a red-eye flight from his home in Nairobi, Kenya, at New York’s John F.

Are we just as frequently stopping to celebrate things that are going well? We all love receiving gratitude, why aren’t we expressing it often enough?</p><p>The recognition culture is precisely about avoiding the pitfall of:</p><blockquote>“No matter how hard you work you never hear a good word from anybody. But make one mistake and there’s always somebody jumping all over you!”</blockquote><p>I first learned about Kudos in Jurgen Appelo’s book on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=asc_df_0321712471/?tag=googshopes-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=54563705115&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9690774498925737917&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1005424&amp;hvtargid=pla-79018669046&amp;psc=1\">Management 3.0</a>. I have the version with pictures called “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/-/pt/dp/1119268680/ref=pd_sbs_1/258-8280429-5165733?pd_rd_w=Q3kSE&amp;pf_rd_p=c289ec33-e7ac-4087-b63e-bf352f1cf145&amp;pf_rd_r=2AB3B9BDHT74BAMWMVW3&amp;pd_rd_r=0ac6a8ea-0630-47e1-b23e-d532b2b7a8ce&amp;pd_rd_wg=vglyT&amp;pd_rd_i=1119268680&amp;psc=1\">Managing for Happiness</a>”. If you haven’t heard about it, I highly recommend getting yourself a copy. If you ever thought about becoming a manager, it is a must-read. It gamifies the experience and is fun to read and practice. I explain more about Management 3.0 and leadership best practices in my article “<a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum/leadership-is-not-a-role-it-is-a-relationship-4d581b07dc68\">Leadership Is Not A Role, It Is A Relationship</a>”.</p><h3><strong>Extrinsic and Intrinsic motivation</strong></h3><p>Kudos are described in the first chapter of the book. The subtitle goes “Motivate people with better rewards”. First, let’s explain the two different kinds of motivation to understand why it is important.</p><p><strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong> is fuelled by external rewards like money, grades, or praise, e.g. the employee of the month. The common pitfall here is that the incentives make people stop doing their tasks just for the joy of well-done work and start looking for rewards. And rewards based on outcomes increase the risk of cheating. People will find any shortcut to get the bonus and in the process, they may lose the enjoyment of work.</p><p>Just think about all those bankers in the US in 2008 who gave out mortgages to their customers like candies just to get their cut. Here’s how a badly thought bonus scheme can drown not only a company but whole countries! <br>Of course, we are talking about knowledge work, in environments based on highly repetitive work, the rewards help keep you going. However, they need to be adjusted from time to time because after some time they may stop working.</p><p><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> is different, here the behavior is triggered from within a person according to their values and judgments. It is where longevity and true engagement will come from.</p><h3><strong>What are Kudos and what do they have to do with intrinsic motivation?</strong></h3><p>Kudo cards are small tokens employees give each other when they want to express gratitude. I am used to using the template Jurgen Appelo has on his <a href=\"https://management30.com/practice/kudo-cards/\">management 3.0 website</a> but you can use anything, even send a short message on Slack.</p><figure><img alt=\"Kudos cards template\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m7zVHjjoAJBEqpWQXgzz1A.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Kudos template as per Management 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>In the old-normality, we would install a Kudo box in the cafeteria of our office. We would ask the employees to recognize each other’s behavior by leaving Kudos Cards in the box. Then on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, during informal company gatherings like breakfasts, we would read the cards aloud. After each readout, the person who received a Kudo would come and pick up their card. As per public recognition, remember? This way we were able to create our Kudos collections on our desk.</p><p>In the remote reality, where many of us will stay for a little longer or forever, you can create a Kudos channel on Slack or Teams. And you can use the online tool I like to use <a href=\"https://kudobox.co/\">kudobox.co</a> to write digital kudos. Once the card is written you can download it or take a screenshot and post it on the channel tagging the person you wish to express gratitude to. In my company the Kudos come on a daily basis.</p><p>When we receive thanks from another colleague in the form of Kudos it usually is unexpected and a sincere way to give thanks. Recognition and public praise elevate our social status. And this stimulates serotonin in the brain. That’s why we feel so good when we are praised. Giving Kudos is a way of recognizing each other. Not just top to bottom but between peers. It is harder to cheat the system when rewards are not scheduled, anticipated, or promised in advance. Plus, having a community that enjoys their interactions helps to keep their engagement and loyalty.</p><p>Elevating social status may seem like an external motivation and to a certain extent, it is. However, status can be a very personal treat. Feeling that others value your input, experience, and willingness to help can go hand in hand with our internal values.</p><h3><strong>Six traits for positive rewards</strong></h3><p>Appelo lists six traits of positive rewards, which also explains why giving Kudos is a great way to stimulate intrinsic motivation:</p><ol><li><strong>Don’t promise rewards in advance</strong> — yearly bonus, an employee of the month, those are anticipated rewards, research shows however that when acknowledgment of work comes as a surprise, intrinsic motivation will not be undermined — Kudos are unexpected.</li><li><strong>Keep anticipated rewards small</strong> — there are a lot of stories about Hackathons at work going awry because a big prize was set. When people focus on the reward instead of a great idea to work on, then their creativity can be hindered and instead of being innovative they will focus on “what the CTO will love most”. So keeping anticipated rewards small is a good idea to keep the creativity.</li><li><strong>Reward continuously not once</strong> — celebrate daily wins and key accomplishments, don’t wait for big events. You can give kudos in digital form on a daily basis by creating a Kudos Slack channel.</li><li><strong>Reward publicly, not privately</strong> — as mentioned previously, the key is to recognize in public and make clear what is being rewarded and why. It gives everyone an idea about the desired behavior according to our company culture.</li><li><strong>Reward behavior not outcome</strong> — outcomes can often be achieved through shortcuts and behavior is about hard work and effort.</li><li><strong>Reward peers, not subordinates </strong>— peers may know better than managers which colleague deserves a reward.</li></ol><h3><strong>Define recognition</strong></h3><p>A good practice I noticed in some companies is to tie the company values to recognition. Let’s imagine one of our company values is to be “Collaborative”. Then on a Kudos template, you would have those values instead of a generic “Good job!”. Typically, you’d have a little description of what “collaborative” means for your company. This can serve as a guide for people to look for certain desirable behavior in their colleagues. This way people are much better fitted to address those qualities in other people’s behavior.</p><h3><strong>What do we write?</strong></h3><p>This is the most important part for me. And for this part, I recommend you watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l7TONauJGfc\">Marshall Rosenberg’s training in Nonviolent Communication</a>. He explains like no one else why saying “Great job!” or “You’re brilliant!” really means nothing. What was the behavior we would like to keep and have more of? We need to name it.</p><p>When expressing gratitude we want to let the other person know specifically what they did that made life more wonderful for us. Not just give some vague generality like “Nice work!”</p><p>Marshall’s proposition is to explain how someone’s behavior has helped us or had a positive effect on us, the product, or the company.</p><ol><li><strong>Describe a concrete action</strong> — bring to other people’s attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. Avoid vague generalizations. E.g. “You offered to help me with the presentation.”</li><li><strong>How did it make you feel </strong>— “I felt relieved when you offered to help”; “I felt energized after the warm-up before the training.”</li><li><strong>What need of yours has been met</strong> —” I felt relieved when you offered to help because I felt very lost. I didn’t know how to start this presentation and needed some direction.”</li></ol><h3><strong>Receiving gratitude</strong></h3><p>The truth is we are somewhat uncomfortable with giving and receiving. Marshall Rosenberg says we are used to receiving gratitude in two polar ways. Both coming from egotism:</p><ol><li><strong>Feeling superior</strong> because we<em> deserved</em> this gratitude.</li><li><strong>Shrugging it off</strong> — saying “That’s nothing”; “De nada”; “Nie ma za co” — we have that expression in many languages. Rosenberg calls it “false humility” as it denies the importance of appreciation.</li></ol><p>Why not receive gratitude joyfully? Why not say, “I’m happy to have helped!” or even “Anytime!”. To do that we need to stop fearing getting thanks.</p><p>I really like the following lines from a book by Marianne Williamson:</p><blockquote>“Playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.”</blockquote><blockquote>“When we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.</blockquote><p>A culture of recognition can be trained. And we can do it in our own way, so it best fits us and our company culture, this way it doesn’t feel fake or forced.

When you have something positive to say about a team member, make sure it is heard, but if you are issuing productive feedback, handle it one-on-one.\nI’d like to explain both in separate articles. Today we will explore how to foster a culture of recognition and why it is important for our Agile companies.\nWe will learn about different kinds of motivation, I will explain what Kudos are, and let’s see how our Kudos box can go digital.\nPlus, I’ll give you a crash course about what Management 3.0 and Nonviolent Communication have to say about recognition. Let’s see how to give thanks like a pro.\nhttps://medium.com/media/ebe663b5651e71cb19921b7733a66b59/href\nRecognition culture\nAs Scrum Masters or Agile Coaches, we are continuously searching for improvement. Are we just as frequently stopping to celebrate things that are going well? We all love receiving gratitude, why aren’t we expressing it often enough?\nThe recognition culture is precisely about avoiding the pitfall of:\n“No matter how hard you work you never hear a good word from anybody. But make one mistake and there’s always somebody jumping all over you!”\nI first learned about Kudos in Jurgen Appelo’s book on Management 3.0. I have the version with pictures called “Managing for Happiness”. If you haven’t heard about it, I highly recommend getting yourself a copy. If you ever thought about becoming a manager, it is a must-read. It gamifies the experience and is fun to read and practice. I explain more about Management 3.0 and leadership best practices in my article “Leadership Is Not A Role, It Is A Relationship”.\nExtrinsic and Intrinsic motivation\nKudos are described in the first chapter of the book. The subtitle goes “Motivate people with better rewards”. First, let’s explain the two different kinds of motivation to understand why it is important.\nExtrinsic motivation is fuelled by external rewards like money, grades, or praise, e.g. the employee of the month. The common pitfall here is that the incentives make people stop doing their tasks just for the joy of well-done work and start looking for rewards. And rewards based on outcomes increase the risk of cheating. People will find any shortcut to get the bonus and in the process, they may lose the enjoyment of work.\nJust think about all those bankers in the US in 2008 who gave out mortgages to their customers like candies just to get their cut. Here’s how a badly thought bonus scheme can drown not only a company but whole countries! \nOf course, we are talking about knowledge work, in environments based on highly repetitive work, the rewards help keep you going. However, they need to be adjusted from time to time because after some time they may stop working.\nIntrinsic motivation is different, here the behavior is triggered from within a person according to their values and judgments. It is where longevity and true engagement will come from.\nWhat are Kudos and what do they have to do with intrinsic motivation?\nKudo cards are small tokens employees give each other when they want to express gratitude. I am used to using the template Jurgen Appelo has on his management 3.0 website but you can use anything, even send a short message on Slack.\nKudos template as per Management 3.0\nIn the old-normality, we would install a Kudo box in the cafeteria of our office. We would ask the employees to recognize each other’s behavior by leaving Kudos Cards in the box. Then on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, during informal company gatherings like breakfasts, we would read the cards aloud. After each readout, the person who received a Kudo would come and pick up their card. As per public recognition, remember? This way we were able to create our Kudos collections on our desk.\nIn the remote reality, where many of us will stay for a little longer or forever, you can create a Kudos channel on Slack or Teams. And you can use the online tool I like to use kudobox.co to write digital kudos. Once the card is written you can download it or take a screenshot and post it on the channel tagging the person you wish to express gratitude to. In my company the Kudos come on a daily basis.\nWhen we receive thanks from another colleague in the form of Kudos it usually is unexpected and a sincere way to give thanks. Recognition and public praise elevate our social status. And this stimulates serotonin in the brain. That’s why we feel so good when we are praised. Giving Kudos is a way of recognizing each other. Not just top to bottom but between peers. It is harder to cheat the system when rewards are not scheduled, anticipated, or promised in advance. Plus, having a community that enjoys their interactions helps to keep their engagement and loyalty.\nElevating social status may seem like an external motivation and to a certain extent, it is. However, status can be a very personal treat. Feeling that others value your input, experience, and willingness to help can go hand in hand with our internal values.\nSix traits for positive rewards\nAppelo lists six traits of positive rewards, which also explains why giving Kudos is a great way to stimulate intrinsic motivation:\n\nDon’t promise rewards in advance — yearly bonus, an employee of the month, those are anticipated rewards, research shows however that when acknowledgment of work comes as a surprise, intrinsic motivation will not be undermined — Kudos are unexpected.\nKeep anticipated rewards small — there are a lot of stories about Hackathons at work going awry because a big prize was set. When people focus on the reward instead of a great idea to work on, then their creativity can be hindered and instead of being innovative they will focus on “what the CTO will love most”. So keeping anticipated rewards small is a good idea to keep the creativity.\nReward continuously not once — celebrate daily wins and key accomplishments, don’t wait for big events. You can give kudos in digital form on a daily basis by creating a Kudos Slack channel.\nReward publicly, not privately — as mentioned previously, the key is to recognize in public and make clear what is being rewarded and why. It gives everyone an idea about the desired behavior according to our company culture.\nReward behavior not outcome — outcomes can often be achieved through shortcuts and behavior is about hard work and effort.\nReward peers, not subordinates — peers may know better than managers which colleague deserves a reward.\n\nDefine recognition\nA good practice I noticed in some companies is to tie the company values to recognition. Let’s imagine one of our company values is to be “Collaborative”. Then on a Kudos template, you would have those values instead of a generic “Good job!”. Typically, you’d have a little description of what “collaborative” means for your company. This can serve as a guide for people to look for certain desirable behavior in their colleagues. This way people are much better fitted to address those qualities in other people’s behavior.\nWhat do we write?\nThis is the most important part for me. And for this part, I recommend you watch Marshall Rosenberg’s training in Nonviolent Communication. He explains like no one else why saying “Great job!” or “You’re brilliant!” really means nothing. What was the behavior we would like to keep and have more of? We need to name it.\nWhen expressing gratitude we want to let the other person know specifically what they did that made life more wonderful for us. Not just give some vague generality like “Nice work!”\nMarshall’s proposition is to explain how someone’s behavior has helped us or had a positive effect on us, the product, or the company.\n\nDescribe a concrete action — bring to other people’s attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. Avoid vague generalizations. E.g. “You offered to help me with the presentation.”\nHow did it make you feel — “I felt relieved when you offered to help”; “I felt energized after the warm-up before the training.”\nWhat need of yours has been met —” I felt relieved when you offered to help because I felt very lost. I didn’t know how to start this presentation and needed some direction.”\n\nReceiving gratitude\nThe truth is we are somewhat uncomfortable with giving and receiving. Marshall Rosenberg says we are used to receiving gratitude in two polar ways. Both coming from egotism:\n\nFeeling superior because we deserved this gratitude.\nShrugging it off — saying “That’s nothing”; “De nada”; “Nie ma za co” — we have that expression in many languages. Rosenberg calls it “false humility” as it denies the importance of appreciation.\n\nWhy not receive gratitude joyfully? Why not say, “I’m happy to have helped!” or even “Anytime!”. To do that we need to stop fearing getting thanks.\nI really like the following lines from a book by Marianne Williamson:\n“Playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.”\n“When we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.\nA culture of recognition can be trained. And we can do it in our own way, so it best fits us and our company culture, this way it doesn’t feel fake or forced. As Scrum Masters, it is part of our role to foster a feedback culture, where inspection and adaptation don’t just happen on a special occasion but become a part of our everyday work.

Choose Scrum for the Right Purpose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Strive for High Product Quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/technical-debt-scrum/\" title=\"Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible? Age-of-Product.com \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Garbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/28-product-backlog-anti-patterns/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns - Age-of-Product.com\" target=\"_blank\">28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns</a>.) </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Embrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Restrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In none of these four areas, a Scrum Master can advance the cause without the deliberate and voluntary support of other people. This is a great challenge many successful Scrum Masters love to address. Unfortunately, however, not all of us are so fortunate to work under these conditions. The frustrated Scrum Master symptom is real; not every Scrum Master who performs below expectations does so because of a lack of competence. Sometimes, former missionaries turn into mercenaries when they see no use to continue fighting inertia, politics, or conflicting agendas. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Possible Reasons Why Missionaries Become a Frustrated Scrum Master</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reasons why able and willing Scrum Masters abandon the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. Probably, the Scrum Master has been working his or her butt off for months, but neither the Scrum Team nor the organization is responding to the effort. There are many potential reasons for a failure at this level, to name a few:</p> \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The lack of sponsoring from the C-level of the organization</li> \r\n\t<li>A widespread belief that &#8216;Agile&#8217; is just the latest management fad, and thus ignorable </li>\r\n\t<li>The company culture values neither transparency nor radical candor</li>\r\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-failure-culture-making-your-scrum-work-10\" title=\"Why Scrum Requires a Failure Culture — Making Your Scrum Work #10\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">company has no failure culture</a>; consequently, everyone plays safe, resulting in short-term orientation as not-failing is more important than innovation </li>\r\n\t<li>The Scrum Team composition is wrong</li>\r\n\t<li>Members of the Scrum Team object self-management</li>\r\n\t<li>There is no psychological safety to address the Scrum Team&#8217;s problems </li>\r\n\t<li>Individual team members harbor personal agendas unaligned with the team&#8217;s objective. </li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These examples can lead an able and willing Scrum Master off the path, resulting in a frustrated Scrum Master either considering leaving for a more supportive environment or turning into a mercenary, trading time for a paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/frustrated-scrum-master/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnwKgNCs7G9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Frustrated Scrum Master — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous reasons why a Scrum Master may leave the path and become a frustrated Scrum Master or even a mercenary. However, before you jump to conclusions, try and understand the context of the development.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. One failure symptom of a botched agile transformation is the frustrated Scrum Master.\n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of a Scrum Master who has thrown in the towel in 92 seconds.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Choose Scrum for the Right Purpose\n\r\n\r\nChoosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n2. Strive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n3. Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n4. Embrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\nIn none of these four areas, a Scrum Master can advance the cause without the deliberate and voluntary support of other people. This is a great challenge many successful Scrum Masters love to address. Unfortunately, however, not all of us are so fortunate to work under these conditions. The frustrated Scrum Master symptom is real; not every Scrum Master who performs below expectations does so because of a lack of competence. Sometimes, former missionaries turn into mercenaries when they see no use to continue fighting inertia, politics, or conflicting agendas. \n\r\n\r\nPossible Reasons Why Missionaries Become a Frustrated Scrum Master\n\r\n\r\nThe reasons why able and willing Scrum Masters abandon the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. Probably, the Scrum Master has been working his or her butt off for months, but neither the Scrum Team nor the organization is responding to the effort. There are many potential reasons for a failure at this level, to name a few:\n \r\n\r\n\t\nThe lack of sponsoring from the C-level of the organization\n \r\n\t\nA widespread belief that ‘Agile’ is just the latest management fad, and thus ignorable \n\r\n\t\nThe company culture values neither transparency nor radical candor\n\r\n\t\nThe company has no failure culture; consequently, everyone plays safe, resulting in short-term orientation as not-failing is more important than innovation \n\r\n\t\nThe Scrum Team composition is wrong\n\r\n\t\nMembers of the Scrum Team object self-management\n\r\n\t\nThere is no psychological safety to address the Scrum Team’s problems \n\r\n\t\nIndividual team members harbor personal agendas unaligned with the team’s objective. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese examples can lead an able and willing Scrum Master off the path, resulting in a frustrated Scrum Master either considering leaving for a more supportive environment or turning into a mercenary, trading time for a paycheck.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Frustrated Scrum Master — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons why a Scrum Master may leave the path and become a frustrated Scrum Master or even a mercenary. However, before you jump to conclusions, try and understand the context of the development. Probably, it does not have anything to do with competence.\n\r\n\r\nHow is your organization failing to support its Scrum Masters, thus advancing the problem of the frustrated Scrum Master?

Moon Express, a finalist for the Google Lunar X Prize (a $30 million competition to land a rover on the moon that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/02/144152/why-getting-back-to-the-moon-is-so-damn-hard/\">was later canceled</a>), has yet to actually make it to space, let alone the moon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Cantrell&#8217;s latest focus is <a href=\"https://www.phantomspace.com/\">Phantom Space</a>, one in a sea of new launch startups seeking to take advantage of the explosion of smaller, cheaper satellite designs and build rockets that can meet the growing demand to launch these payloads into orbit. But as is par for the course with Cantrell, Phantom is trying to find success by swimming against the current.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the hottest trends in rockets right now is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/09/65208/rocket-ride-shares-could-make-going-to-space-like-catching-a-bus/\">ride-share launches</a>, where customers buy available spots for their payloads on a midsize or large rocket with a specific departure date. This is usually a cheaper way than single launches for customers to get a payload into space—with SpaceX’s ride-share program, it costs $1 million to launch a 200-kilogram payload (its Falcon 9 rocket can take 22,800 kg total into low Earth orbit). The company launched a dedicated ride-share mission on January 21, deploying a record 143 satellites into orbit. It’s following up with a similar mission in June. In a surprising about-face in March, Rocket Lab, which has long resisted the idea of building larger rockets, unveiled the Neutron&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/02/1020212/rocket-lab-could-be-spacexs-biggest-rival-neutron-falcon-9/\">for the precise purpose of doing ride-share launches</a>&nbsp;and competing with the SpaceX Falcon 9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride shares aren’t Phantom’s cup of tea. The company wants to establish its space footprint by mass-manufacturing small rockets and launching a hundred a year. “We want to be the Henry Ford of space,” says Cantrell. “We’re taking a contrarian view of how we develop this.” Just as Henry Ford didn’t reinvent the car but the way it was built, Phantom isn’t out to reinvent rockets—just their production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How so? When SpaceX started, the supply chains for aerospace companies going into orbit were enmeshed in the financial system of the US Defense Department. To stay independent of that system, SpaceX decided to build everything itself, relying on Musk’s fortune and a ton of investment to stay afloat during years of losses. It was a long-term gamble that paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Phantom’s founders decided they didn’t need to follow suit. Even in just the last five years, aerospace supply chains have become more fluid and competitive, which means Phantom can just buy the specific parts it wants rather than build everything from scratch. It buys 3D-printed engines from Ursa Major in Colorado. The design of the flight computer was licensed from NASA, and it uses a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beagleboard.org/black\">BeagleBone Black board</a> that some distributors sell for around $50. Other components, like batteries and telemetry systems, are bought through the missile defense supply chain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Henry Ford analogy isn’t just an aspiration—it’s a model for the company. Cofounder Michael D’Angelo says the car and rocket businesses follow similar growth curves: doubling production leads to certain economies of scale also associated with greater efficiency and fewer production errors. Computers and mobile devices followed a similar path. And he argues that the supply chains nowadays are mature enough to allow for the kind of speedy manufacturing Phantom wants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the company is pursuing two types of rockets. There’s the 18.7-meter-tall Daytona, which should be able to lift about 450 kilograms into space. It’s perhaps on the larger end of what might be termed the small-rocket class, but according to Cantrell, the company’s analysis estimates this to be an optimum size for profitable activity. Then there’s Laguna, a 20.5-meter-tall rocket that can lift payloads of up to 1,200 kg. Phantom is developing a version of Laguna with a reusable first-stage booster, like a SpaceX Falcon 9 (with a similar vertical landing process).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2338\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1025355\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg 2338w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=768,591 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=1536,1183 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Phantom-Daytona-.jpg?resize=2048,1577 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2338px) 100vw, 2338px\" /><figcaption>An artist&#8217;s rendering of the Daytona rocket flying into space.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">PHANTOM SPACE</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Phantom is hoping to fill a gap in the market. While ride shares are cheap, customers have less control over how the mission goes. A ride-share mission, like a train, is on a fixed route. If you want your satellite to go a different orbit or trajectory, you need to install expensive thrusters that can take it there. Otherwise, you have to redesign its function for the new orbit, tolerate a less favorable orbit, or simply buy a ticket for a different mission. And you better hope your satellite can fit snugly with all the other payloads it’s going with—these flights are fully booked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small-rocket launch might cost more, but it gives control back to the customer. If you have a mission with very specific requirements—like replacing a particular satellite in a constellation, launching sensitive equipment, or running an expensive tech demo—you’ll probably want a dedicated flight rather than a ride share. “There’s definitely an interest and demand for these small-rocket launches,” says Ryan Martineau, a space system engineer at the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Utah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cantrell thinks Phantom can meet this demand without blowing its budget. He estimates that the company’s approach can actually offer launches for a third the price of the ride-share model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, though, the company has to actually get to space. The aim is for Daytona to make its first spaceflight in 2023. Classically, says Cantrell, there’s a 50% reliability rate for the first four flights of a new rocket. Phantom’s plans more or less assume that at least one of its first four flights gets to orbit. It recently signed a lease from the Air Force for a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and it is currently looking for permission to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as well—important initial steps if 100 launches a year is truly the goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phantom also wants to build satellites and become something of a one-stop shop for customers. Its acquisition of Cantrell’s StratSpace this week is supposed to be a key part of this side of the business. The company is working on constellation prototypes for customers and is part of a group developing a commercially funded $1.2 billion science mission (specific details won&#8217;t be disclosed for several months).

Add a new step somewhere after the “Flutter Build” and find “Android Sign” in Bitrise steps directory. To find it you will need to switch the filter on the right side to “all”\n\nYou don’t need to change anything, default values work for us. Try to run your workflow and see if Build phase passes successfully.\nUpload first signed build to Play Market\nBefore you can upload builds via Google Play API you should upload an initial build manually, to initialize newly created app.\nAfter the lates build has completed, open it’s “APPS & ARTIFACTS” section, find and download your signed *-signed.aab file in there.\n\nThen, go to Google Play Console, navigate to your app’s Releases-Closed testing sub-section, create, setup and rollout your first release for your internal testers. To do this you will need to fill in quite a few forms and upload app’s logo and some dummy screenshots. Don’t worry about the content at this stage, you can edit everything later, just paste some “lorem ipsum” stuff in there to complete the setup and activate the Alpha release track. This step is important to activate an ability to rollout subsequent releases via API.\nConfigure Developer API Access\nTo upload builds using Google Play API you need to configure Developer API Access. Navigate to Google Play Console → Settings → API Access and link your Google Cloud project, either existing or create a new one like I did.\n\nafter a project is linked, create a new Service Account, the process is pretty straightforward, do not skip the permissions step and grant your Service Account an access to your Google Play Console.\n\nAfter the Service Account is created, go to it’s Keys section, generate and download a new key\n\nAfter it’s done, you will be navigated back to Play Console API access settings page and after the list of service accounts refreshed you will see the created account in it. Click Grant access and it’s done.\n\nConfigure the final step, uploading\nGo back to your Bitrise App’s workflow, add a new step after “Android Sign” and find “Google Play Deploy” step in the list.\n\nThe only thing to configure in this step are our app’s “Package Name” (aka Bundle ID) and “Track”, which can be set to any track you want for your pipeline (e.g. alpha, beta, release etc). I used “internal” track for my dev builds.\nThat’s it, folks! Hope this was helpful (clap three times in this case ;)\nPitfalls\nIn this section I’ll list errors and problems I met and had to figure out how to solve while was setting up the workflow. Just to help someone who might be looking for a solution in the future.\n“java.io.ioexception: Invalid keystore format”\nIn my case I first generated the keystore using Oracle Java v16, and it’s not compatible with openJDK that bitrise is using, I solved the problem by generating the key store using Android Studio UI.\nFailed to validate edit, error: googleapi: Error 400: Only releases with status draft may be created on draft app.\nyou can’t push your uploaded build into any Release track when your app is in Draft state. To solve this — configure and roll out the Alpha track manually.\nResources\nhttps://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android\nhttps://medium.com/bewizyu/part-1-how-to-setup-a-flutter-application-with-bitrise-346dba7d1bab\nhttps://blog.bitrise.io/how-to-deploy-android-app-to-google-play-store\nhttps://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started\nhttps://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/generating-and-deploying-android-app-bundles/\n\nBuild a Flutter Android app and deploy it to Google Play  using Bitrise CI/CD platform was originally published in Geek Culture on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Igor Kurochka","guid":"https://medium.com/p/68de0612ede","categories":["automation","flutter","android","bitrise","ci-cd-pipeline"],"isoDate":"2021-05-26T08:25:06.000Z"},{"creator":"Arnold Abraham","title":"Your Guide for One of TypeScript’s Most Useful Concepts","link":"https://medium.com/geekculture/your-guide-for-one-of-typescripts-most-useful-concepts-8e62b92d1d93?source=rss----9758482ba857---4","pubDate":"Wed, 26 May 2021 08:24:54 GMT","dc:creator":"Arnold Abraham","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture/your-guide-for-one-of-typescripts-most-useful-concepts-8e62b92d1d93?source=rss----9758482ba857---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*mzyehgOA8W5SgZJnbtTxuw.png\" width=\"1000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">Generics 101 of TypeScript</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture/your-guide-for-one-of-typescripts-most-useful-concepts-8e62b92d1d93?source=rss----9758482ba857---4\">Continue reading on Geek Culture »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"Generics 101 of TypeScript\nContinue reading on Geek Culture »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/8e62b92d1d93","categories":["front-end-development","typescript","software-development","javascript","guides-and-tutorials"],"isoDate":"2021-05-26T08:24:54.000Z"},{"creator":"Programmer101N","title":"Create bot for your Discord Server","link":"https://medium.com/geekculture/create-bot-for-your-discord-server-59989b39f6fa?source=rss----9758482ba857---4","pubDate":"Wed, 26 May 2021 08:24:36 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>In this blog, We will create bot for your discord server which can perform variety of commands.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0q4YrfG8DKU4Dbuj.png\" /></figure><h4>What we need for this tutorial</h4><ul><li>NodeJs and NPM installed</li><li>discord.js</li><li>dotenv</li></ul><h4>Setting up project</h4><p>Create a folder named discord_bot and initialize a node project in that folder with npm init -y command.

Then that server responds with a resource such as images, videos, or HTML web page, which your browser going to displays for you. So, this is the simplest way to answer that question. However, we all know there are lot more happening on the underline. But in this article, we are going to learn about one of the main components of this process, HTTP protocol.</p><h3>What is HTTP?</h3><p>The HTTP acronym stands for <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong>. HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web (WWW) to exchange information, that found on web pages. When accessing any web page entering “<strong>http://”</strong> in front of the address tells the web browser to communicate over HTTP. For example, the URL for Google is https://www.google.com. But if you notice, today’s browsers no longer require HTTP in front of the URL since it is the default method of communication. However, it is kept in browsers because of the need to separate protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p><blockquote><strong>Other notable protocols are:</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</strong> is a standard protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):</strong> is a standard for email transmission.</blockquote><p>HTTP is defined as a <strong>stateless</strong>, “client-server” protocol or “request-response” protocol. Stateless means that all requests are separate from each other. So, every request from your browser must contain enough information on its own for the server to fulfill the request. That means each request is executed without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it or after it.</p><p>The client-server protocol describes the communication between two computers. The client (browser or another application) requests data and the server provide a response. So, this is how we can go to a website and see information on that website.

So basically, the only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. Because of that HTTPS can protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

So, this is when a client device (web browser), asks the server for the information needed to load the website. The request provides the server with the desired information it needs to adjust its response to the client device. There are several HTTP request methods known as <strong>Get, Post, Delete, Put, and Head</strong>. However, in this case it used the Get request, because it is how we get the content of that web site.</p><ul><li><strong>GET:</strong> The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI.

Software applications like web browsers and email clients depend on the application layer to initiate communications. To make things clear, that client software applications are not part of the application layer.

This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a <strong>bit stream, </strong>which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.</p><p>So, this is the end of the article and I hope you enjoyed it.

Then that server responds with a resource such as images, videos, or HTML web page, which your browser going to displays for you. So, this is the simplest way to answer that question. However, we all know there are lot more happening on the underline. But in this article, we are going to learn about one of the main components of this process, HTTP protocol.\nWhat is HTTP?\nThe HTTP acronym stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web (WWW) to exchange information, that found on web pages. When accessing any web page entering “http://” in front of the address tells the web browser to communicate over HTTP. For example, the URL for Google is https://www.google.com. But if you notice, today’s browsers no longer require HTTP in front of the URL since it is the default method of communication. However, it is kept in browsers because of the need to separate protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).\nOther notable protocols are:\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP): is a standard protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network.\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): is a standard for email transmission.\nHTTP is defined as a stateless, “client-server” protocol or “request-response” protocol. Stateless means that all requests are separate from each other. So, every request from your browser must contain enough information on its own for the server to fulfill the request. That means each request is executed without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it or after it.\nThe client-server protocol describes the communication between two computers. The client (browser or another application) requests data and the server provide a response. So, this is how we can go to a website and see information on that website. With HTTP protocol, the client request always happens first and is followed by the server’s response.\nImage: How HTTP Works (https://whatis.techtarget.com/)\nHTTP vs. HTTPS\nThe S in HTTPS is stands for “secure.” HTTPS uses TLS or SSL to encrypt HTTP requests and responses.

Product Leader</h3><p>This is Part 1 of the “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@James_Wang-Product/becoming-a-product-leader-introduction-3410931eb7ce\">Becoming a Product Leader</a>” series. In this series, I’m tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to become a Product Leader. This article focuses on shifting one’s perspective from a team level Product Manager to an organization wide Product Leader.</p><p>The biggest obstacle I faced when trying to move from Product Manager to Product Leader was my own mindset. I had a number of attitudes and beliefs that were counterproductive and held me back:</p><ul><li>Leadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.</li><li>How am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.</li><li>I can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.</li></ul><p>You may or may not suffer from any of these misconceptions. But I’ve seen other experienced individual contributors making the same mistakes, banging their heads against the ceiling of management and leadership.</p><p>Changing my perspective was difficult and is an ongoing struggle. But pushing myself to a new mindset has made all the difference in my ability to be a leader.</p><blockquote>Leadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OSsjJuFf0YLqAUofDApYZw.png\" /></figure><h3>Don’t Wait to Be Invited</h3><p>People can hold themselves back by thinking it’s not their place to take on organizational initiatives. Whether they think it’s not their responsibility or not in their authority, they can find reasons not to try to tackle large problems.</p><p>For a while, I had a pretty rigid hierarchical view of how organizations worked. I believed that each role had a specific area of responsibility and authority, and operating outside of those bounds wasn’t appropriate. So when I saw problems in organization wide strategy or gaps in major processes, I’d complain to my manager or leadership.</p><p>And I got frustrated, because the problems would generally persist, and it felt like nothing that I said mattered.</p><p>More than anything, my beliefs about having the <em>authority</em> to drive large initiatives was holding me back. I had no problems driving changes for my team or even working with my peers to make small changes in our process. But larger, organizational changes felt outside of the authority of a simple team-level Product Manager.</p><p>Talking to my manager and other leaders helped me to challenge this thinking. Yes, there were some decisions that would be difficult to involve myself in. But there were countless other initiatives and problems that needed driving that any individual could take on.</p><p>And there wasn’t any magical authority that came with moving up to a higher level that suddenly changed how things needed to get done. I wanted to be in a position where people would have to listen to me. But being a great leader isn’t about relying on your title to ram changes through; it’s about building trust through effective collaboration and swaying hearts and minds to align on goals and a direction.</p><p>It was obvious in hindsight, but it was helpful having someone point it out to me: I didn’t need the title to do the work.</p><p>But why should I take on all this extra work if I couldn’t be certain it would mean a promotion?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TuPGcKTA2DNhEYGZkiu_8w.png\" /></figure><h3>Don’t Look For Guarantees</h3><p>Moving into a leadership position can require taking on a number of responsibilities above and beyond your day to day role. And few people embrace the idea of doing extra work without some kind of compensation and recognition. I often looked at it from a transactional perspective: if I did this work, was I going to get promoted? How many features did I need to launch? How many initiatives did I need to drive? How many people did I need to mentor?</p><p>It usually doesn’t work like that. Your manager and senior leaders won’t make such promises, because 1) these roles are filled based on business needs, and 2) just because you checked some boxes doesn’t mean you&#39;ve proven you can thrive in the new position.</p><p>People need to trust that you have the attitude, aptitude, and capacity to be great at the next level. They need to believe that they should continue to invest in you. There are a lot qualities that your leadership team is looking for. Many of which they won’t or don’t know how to articulate. Doing the work provides an opportunity for you to actually discover, practice, and demonstrate those qualities.</p><p>And if you really want to be in the role, you should want to do the work. If your only interest in taking on a complex cross-organizational initiative is to have the title, then you’re going about this backwards. Moving into the role makes those kinds of challenges your job. If you don’t enjoy mentoring and coaching other PMs, why do you want to be a manager? If you don’t embrace the value and impact of driving alignment with multiple leaders, why do you want to make that your day to day responsibility?</p><p>If you want to do the work, you should do the work.</p><blockquote>How am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zY9m8k8qs4Y17q2VTUqq2g.png\" /></figure><h3>Embrace the Uncertainty</h3><p>The initiatives and problems you drive as a Product Leader are much more complex, much less certain. Building confidence and alignment across an organization in the face of such uncertainty is difficult. But it’s all the more important because of that uncertainty.</p><p>When taking on larger initiatives — whether new product discovery, a major operational shift, or a change in strategy — there is not going to be an obvious right answer. You may never know the correct answer. No one will. But a plan needs to be made, and the job is creating and selling it in a way that folks will believe in it.</p><p>On larger organizational initiatives, you will rarely be able to get to the same level of confidence as you were able to reach at the team level. There are too many variables. Once you involve multiple products and multiple teams, the complexities increase exponentially. Greater dependencies between teams means reduced confidence in technical approaches and delivery dates. Making a change to your product offerings can have ripple effects on customer purchasing decisions.</p><p>Driving bigger changes means accepting you won’t have the perfect data to justify a decision. Instead, it increases the need to build confidence in that decision across an organization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CU8EWiyjstDHq2qEZwqKdg.png\" /></figure><h4>Collaborate to Build Confidence</h4><p>Collaborating with more leaders reduces uncertainty. It increases the likelihood that a plan will succeed. And critically, it increases other people’s confidence in the plan.</p><p>As a seasoned Product Manager, you should have honed your product instincts to identify major opportunities and risks. Other leaders across your organization likewise will have built up their own instincts that you should leverage.</p><p>Their instincts and experience can help fill gaps in your knowledge or identify risks that you didn’t see. They’ll connect you with data or individuals who can answer critical questions. And they’ll help you build a stronger case to get buy in from other stakeholders and the leadership team.</p><p>Effective collaboration is the foundation for the success of any major initiative. And the bigger the initiative, the more important that collaboration is.</p><blockquote>I can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZJSuvj6kiP05gvNXr_H5uw.png\" /></figure><h3>Prioritizing the Team and the Organization</h3><p>Leaders often have to make hard prioritization decisions that impact multiple teams. Sometimes one team’s goals has to be deprioritized in favor of a more critical organizational goal. It’s not pretty, and it can hurt morale— but it sometimes needs to be done.</p><p>Learning how to balance the needs of the organization against the needs of your immediate team can be a difficult challenge. But your job isn’t just to be a great Product Manager for your team; it’s to be a great Product Manager for your organization. As a Product Leader, you need to prioritize your time and your teams’ time wisely to ensure the highest impact for the business and your customers.</p><p>There are two key challenges here:</p><ul><li>Putting the organization’s objectives ahead of an individual team’s objectives.</li><li>Balancing your time and effort between serving the organization vs. serving the team.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yeVVdAzet8iyrUWO-gI2Bg.png\" /></figure><h4>Prioritizing the Roadmap to Serve the Organization</h4><p>There are often opportunities to support goals that don’t directly benefit your team, or slows your team down from achieving its goals. But taking these opportunities can drive better outcomes for the business, rather than if every team operated selfishly towards their own goals.</p><p>My team was working on a brand new product area, while most of the rest of the organization was working on <a href=\"https://construction.autodesk.com/\">unifying our core products</a>. Our project was new and shiny, serving the goals of exciting our customers and driving new business opportunities. By contrast, the rest of the org’s work was less glamorous, but absolutely essential to the overall success of the business.</p><p>One of the teams we were partnering with — and were heavily dependent on — was falling behind on its roadmap. This team’s product area was a foundational piece of the unified offering, and a platform on which many other teams would be developing.</p><p>We could have protected our own goals and roadmap — eating down other features in our backlog while we waited for them to catch up, or building on their platform with narrowly scoped solutions that worked only for us. Instead we collaborated with them to take on several initiatives that unblocked our team but would also serve to expand their platform for other teams.</p><p>We cost ourselves some of our velocity towards our own goals, but we accelerated adoption across the organization. And we demonstrated that we could put the good of the organization ahead of ourselves.</p><p>An important part of making this kind of decision is being highly visible. Your manager and leaders should have insight into the decision making process to ensure that this is the best course of action for the business. And your leaders should be fully aware that you’ve put the needs of the organization first.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TN9JaWFVY4k-gx2ObfL82A.png\" /></figure><h4>Prioritizing Your Time to Serve the Organization</h4><p>As a Product Manager, it can be difficult to move your focus away from the team and towards side projects. But your time is a valuable resource and prioritizing that time ruthlessly is a necessary part of being a Product Leader. Over-investing in a single team becomes a waste of your skills as you grow more seasoned and capable of impacting an organization.</p><p>I had to find my own balance in taking on side projects for the organization and doing the work for my team. As the PM on a team, you need to continue to deliver results and ensure progress and challenges are communicated up to leadership. But a lot of the invisible work that PMs do to ensure the success of the team can become unnecessary or even counterproductive. In my past, I’ve pulled a lot of teams together through grit and duct tape. I’ve been the definer, driver, and maintainer of processes that kept the team moving fast. I’ve done a lot of QA to ensure features were delivered with high quality. I’ve pulled data to make decisions on minor interactions. At a certain point, all the extra work starts to have diminishing returns.</p><p>Additionally, taking on too much responsibility can actually hamper the team’s ability to succeed. You don’t want to be the bottleneck for every minor UI decision, or not be able to trust your devs to make sure that their work meets the design and acceptance criteria. You don’t want a release to become chaos just because you were out sick. You can infantilize a team by taking away all responsibility outside of committing code. Instead, aim to find a balance that ensures the whole team is responsible for the success of the team and the product.</p><p>When my team shifted from product discovery and prototyping to production of a beta MVP, I made a decision to be less involved in the details. This meant putting the responsibility of defining and maintaining processes on the developers. I set high level expectations and provided feedback, but left it to the team to work out how they wanted to operate. This resulted in a lot more sprint iterations to find the best way forward, but it empowered the individuals to own the process and the improvements. Likewise, I tried to find a balance in the detail of my specs and in answering questions vs. ensuring everyone understood the customer problems we were trying to solve and trusting them to come up with good answers on their own.</p><p>This is an entire topic of itself, but I sought an approach of “minimum viable product management” for day to day execution. I did enough to ensure that the team and product would be successful, without chasing the last 10% of optimal product execution. It wasn’t easy to find a balance, but my team was understanding. They respected and appreciated that I was trying to drive larger improvements across the organization, and many of the devs on my team appreciated the opportunity to take more ownership.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I had to shift my perspective in a number of ways before I embodied the qualities of the kind of leader I wanted to be. And it’s still a struggle. I can fall back on bad habits and negative mindsets.

The test kitchen gets seen as an anchor rather than as an accelerant. A hindrance that keeps a company from getting a product to market sooner. Why not just build it and get it into customers hands? Keep in mind that behind this question is almost always a vague plan of product awareness and distribution. Test kitchens have been used effectively in almost every physical product and process industry because these product creators know the value of testing and iterating on a product and process in a real-world environment to remove inefficiencies and points of friction before more releasing more broadly.</p><p>Software product creators should be adopting the physical product and process creator perspective of using a test kitchen because it works. Software products too frequently get created with too much user and process friction because the products aren’t being used in real life and work circumstances. If you want to create and release software products that better align with a user’s problem, workflow, and have less friction then do so in a test kitchen.</p><p>Here are some of examples of software products being created in test kitchens and why these products and companies have been successful and will likely continue to succeed:</p><h3><strong>giftHEALTH</strong></h3><p>giftHEALTH is creating a new Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) product and has recently raised a $5 million seed round. The most interesting thing about giftHEALTH to me is their decision to buy and operate a pharmacy as a test kitchen for their PBM product.</p><p>I’ve been able to get to know founder Nick Potts over the past few years and he credits their test kitchen in helping to speed up their product development, create more empathy between the product team and users, and to reduce friction in the product faster than they otherwise would be able to.</p><p>giftHEALTH’s pharmacy test kitchen has also been instrumental in helping to raise investment fairly quickly because investors are emboldened by the company’s ability to create the best product by testing and iterating on it using their own pharmacy as a test kitchen.</p><blockquote>“Having our own pharmacy gives us firsthand exposure to the pharmacy and patient experience. We have a direct feedback loop with our pharmacy for determining areas of improvement and quickly testing new innovative solutions. This sets us up for launching a refined product experience for all of our partners.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>Daniel Dalton, Director of Product at giftHEALTH</em></blockquote><h3><strong>Bevy</strong></h3><p>Bevy is a platform for organizations to facilitate and manage their communities. Bevy recently raised over $40m to continue to grow the company.</p><p>Bevy’s growth is interesting, and the team has been executing well, but what I’m most intrigued by and impressed with is how the company got started and the genesis of the product. And I have had a birds-eye of it happening, which has been fun.</p><p>Bevy’s product was unintentionally incubated through a sister organization, Startup Grind. Startup Grind is a global community that helps to inform, support, and bring together entrepreneurs through local chapters and events. Startup Grind created a product to facilitate and manage the Startup Grind community. As the Startup Grind community continued to grow and evolve the product did as well. The product was initially called the Startup Grind Dashboard. Yep, creative naming.</p><p>Turns out that as the Startup Grind Dashboard continued to evolve and become more robust to support Startup Grind’s community management needs, the Startup Grind leadership team realized the product might be able to be used by other organizations to manage their communities. They were right and now that’s Bevy.</p><p>Startup Grind served as an unintentional test kitchen for the product that eventually become the Bevy platform. Startup Grind’s community management needs facilitated the Startup Grind dashboard to get created and evolved inside of a real-world usage environment. There would be no Bevy platform and no Bevy company if it hadn’t been for Startup Grind serving as a test kitchen, even if unknowingly.</p><h3><strong>Hopewell</strong></h3><p>Hopewell is helping companies to empower their team members to do their best work by providing a re-designed work experience and environment that supports them.</p><p>Hopewell started with a physical lab in Columbus and have now opened a second one in Louisville. The physical lab helps Hopewell showcase what can be done from a physical perspective to create an environment for focused or collaborative work. The labs are also a great test kitchen for Hopewell to evaluate technologies and to gather data on work preferences and what they need to support their best work.</p><p>With the pandemic hastening the need for companies to better understand and support their team members working from anywhere also comes the need to rethink the traditional work environment. Hopewell is using its labs to expose companies to new perspectives around space and tools to foster a better team member experience.</p><p>The future of work is the present and the best way to align what people need to do their best work is to do inside of labs where different environments and tools can be tested and evolved.</p><h3><strong>SureImpact</strong></h3><p>A professional services firm wanting to have a product and to have the elusive, but highly desirable, recurring revenue is common. What isn’t common is a services firm being able to pull it off. SureImpact is a new software product company out of decade old services firm that is doing just that.</p><p>Services firms have an advantage over other companies when it comes to a test kitchen environment because the services firms that have the opportunity to productize some aspect of their process or intellectual property means they have a built-in, legacy test kitchen.</p><p>Services firms that successfully leverage their existing and past clients to become early users and advisers while creating a new product can create an early product faster and more in alignment with client needs than having to do so from scratch. Services firms can integrate the new product into their existing client relationships and workflows by demonstrating a value-add to their existing clients, while they are marketing the new product to potential new customers. With the ability to use current clients to help shape the product and get early product validation, there is little need to bring any outsiders in on the early process. This accelerates the early product creation and validation cycles. It is also much easier to iterate with existing clients that a services firm knows they can trust and rely on when collaborating on the functionality and user experience of a new product.</p><p>Products like SureImpact that are created inside of an existing services firm’s operation have many advantages that come from incubation inside the firm.</p><h3><strong>Common Test Kitchen Traits</strong></h3><p>Creating a new product in a test kitchen has several advantages and when possible, a test kitchen environment should be setup. As described above, test kitchens for new software products can take on many different forms and types but they all have these attributes in common:</p><ul><li>A test kitchen is <strong>owned </strong>by the company creating the new product. A test kitchen isn’t a focus group exercise or some arm’s length research endeavor. For a test kitchen to be effective in creating a new software product it needs to be part of the company creating the product.</li><li>A test kitchen is <strong>valued, invested, and supported </strong>as if it is crucial part of the company…because it is. A test kitchen that is a just for show, like many corporate innovation labs, aren’t really test kitchens.</li><li>A test kitchen is as close to <strong>real use</strong> as possible. For a test kitchen to provide as much insight and value as possible it has to be as real life as possible. In all the examples provided above they were and are test kitchens that work and provide value for customers or clients.</li><li>The best test kitchens can <strong>live on their own.</strong> Another thing all of the above examples have in common and good test kitchens for product creation do, is that the test kitchen can and often does operate as its own entity. Bevy now operates apart from Startup Grind. giftHEALTH’s pharmacy operates as a fully functioning pharmacy. SureImpact is able to serve clients separate from its services firm Measurement Resources. You can be a customer of Hopewell’s software product without being a member of their lab.</li></ul><p>There are key stakeholder benefits to a test kitchen as part of product development as well. Customers will value the product having been designed and developed as close to their real world as possible. This lowers the risk associated to implementing a new product. Investors, if that investment makes sense for a product and company, will be intrigued by the customer product fit established by leveraging a test kitchen to create a product. A test kitchen establishes for both customers and investors that the creators of a product understand the problem and how to solve it in practical terms.</p><p>Product creators are always looking for ways to quickly test, validate, and iterate. A test kitchen provides the platform to do so based on real operational and service’s needs. There is no better and more intimate way to understand the job to be done than to build a product to support the job to be done in real-time. More startups and corporate innovation teams creating products should give strong consideration how they can implement a test kitchen to support their product creation.</p><p>If you are in the process of, or considering, building a digital product and you need technical assistance, consider partnering with <a href=\"https://awh.net/insights/post?post=affordance-in-design\">AWH</a>.

We do this in ways we are aware of, and ways that we aren’t. Corporations are eager to take advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for instance, NumberEight, a startup, that, according to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/companies-track-phones-movements-target-ads/\">Wired</a>, “helps apps infer user activity based on data from a smartphone’s sensors: whether they’re running or seated, near a park or museum, driving or riding a train.” New services based on such technology, “will combine what they know about a user’s activity on their own apps with information on what they’re doing physically at the time.” With this information, “instead of building a profile to target, say, women over 35, a service could target ads to  ‘early risers.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such ambitions are widespread. As <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/05/getting-ai-to-scale\">this recent Harvard Business Review article puts</a> it, “Most CEOs recognize that artificial intelligence has the potential to completely change how organizations work. They can envision a future in which, for example, retailers deliver individualized products before customers even request them—perhaps on the very same day those products are made.” As corporations use AI in more and more distinct domains, the article foretells, “their AI capabilities will rapidly compound, and they’ll find that the future they imagined is actually closer than it once appeared.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even today, let alone in such a future, technology can completely obliterate privacy. Coming up with laws and policies to stop it from doing so is a vital task for governments.As the Biden administration and Congress contemplate federal privacy legislation they must not succumb to a common fallacy. Laws guarding the privacy of people’s data are not only about protecting individuals. They are also about protecting our rights as members of groups—as part of society as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The harm to any one individual in a group that results from a violation of privacy rights might be relatively small or hard to pin down, but the harm to the group as a whole can be profound. Say Amazon uses its data on consumer behavior to figure out which products are worth copying and then undercuts the manufacturers of products it sells, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag\">like shoes or camera bags</a>. Though the immediate harm is to the shoemaker or the camera-bag maker, the longer-term—and ultimately more lasting—harm is to consumers, who are robbed over the long run of the choices that come from transacting in a truly open and equitable marketplace. And whereas the shoemaker or camera-bag manufacturer can try to take legal action, it’s much tougher for consumers to demonstrate how Amazon’s practices harm them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a tricky concept to understand. Class action lawsuits, where many individuals join together even though each might have suffered only a small harm, are a good conceptual analogy. Big tech companies understand the commercial benefits they can derive from analyzing the data of groups while superficially protecting the data of individuals through <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/technology/differential-privacy/\">mathematical techniques like differential privacy</a>. But regulators continue to focus on protecting individuals or, at best, protected classes like people of particular genders, ages, ethnicities, or sexual orientations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an algorithm discriminates against people by sorting them into groups that do not fall into these protected classes, antidiscrimination laws don’t apply in the United States. (Profiling techniques like those Facebook uses to help machine-learning models sort users are probably illegal under European Union data protection laws, but this has not yet been litigated.) Many people will not even know that they were profiled or discriminated against, which makes it tough to bring legal action. They no longer feel the unfairness, the injustice, firsthand—and that has historically been a precondition to launching a claim.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/0685a4ba-7b0b-442b-b38e-3f73101a6943\">Individuals</a> should not have to fight for their data privacy rights and be responsible for every consequence of their digital actions. Consider an analogy: people have a right to safe drinking water, but they aren’t urged to exercise that right by checking the quality of the water with a pipette every time they have a drink at the tap. Instead, regulatory agencies act on everyone’s behalf to ensure that all our water is safe. The same must be done for digital privacy: it isn’t something the average user is, or should be expected to be, personally competent to protect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two parallel approaches that should be pursued to protect the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is better use of class or group actions, otherwise known as collective redress actions. Historically, these have been limited in Europe, but in November 2020 the European parliament <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/class-action-lawsuits-to-become-eu-law/a-55711222\">passed a measure</a> that requires all 27 EU member states to implement measures allowing for collective redress actions across the region. Compared with the US, the EU has stronger laws protecting consumer data and promoting competition, so class or group action lawsuits in Europe can be a powerful tool for lawyers and activists to force big tech companies to change their behavior even in cases where the per-person damages would be very low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Class action lawsuits have most often been used in the US to seek financial damages, but they can also be used to force changes in policy and practice. They can work hand in hand with campaigns to change public opinion, especially in consumer cases (for example, by forcing Big Tobacco to admit to the link between smoking and cancer, or by paving the way for car seatbelt laws). They are powerful tools when there are thousands, if not millions, of similar individual harms, which add up to help prove causation. Part of the problem is getting the right information to sue in the first place. Government efforts, like a lawsuit brought against Facebook in December by the<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-privacy-on-collision-course/\"> Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a group of 46 states</a>, are crucial. As the tech journalist Gilad Edelman puts it, “According to the lawsuits, the erosion of user privacy over time is a form of consumer harm—a social network that protects user data less is an inferior product—that tips Facebook from a mere monopoly to an illegal one.” In the US, as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/google-facebook-private-antitrust.html\">recently reported</a>, private lawsuits, including class actions, often “lean on evidence unearthed by the government investigations.” In the EU, however, it’s the other way around: private lawsuits can open up the possibility of regulatory action, which is constrained by the gap between EU-wide laws and national regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to the second approach: a little-known 2016 French law called the Digital Republic Bill. The <a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichLoiPubliee.do?idDocument=JORFDOLE000031589829&amp;type=general&amp;legislature=14\">Digital Republic Bill</a> is one of the few modern laws focused on automated decision making. The law currently applies only to administrative decisions taken by public-sector algorithmic systems. But it provides a sketch for what future laws could look like. It says that the source code behind such systems must be made available to the public. Anyone can request that code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, the law enables advocacy organizations to request information on the functioning of an algorithm and the source code behind it even if they don’t represent a specific individual or claimant who is allegedly harmed. The need to find a “perfect plaintiff” who can prove harm in order to file a suit makes it very difficult to tackle the systemic issues that cause collective data harms. Laure Lucchesi, the director of Etalab, a French government office in charge of overseeing the bill, says that the law’s focus on algorithmic accountability was ahead of its time. Other laws, like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), focus too heavily on individual consent and privacy. But both the data and the algorithms need to be regulated.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-right is-style-large\"><p>The need to find a “perfect plaintiff” who can prove harm in order to file a suit makes it very difficult to tackle the systemic issues that cause collective data harms. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89_GV053CiI\">Apple</a> promises in one advertisement: “Right now, there is more private information on your phone than in your home. Your locations, your messages, your heart rate after a run. These are private things. And they should belong to you.” Apple is reinforcing this individualist’s fallacy: by failing to mention that your phone stores more than just your personal data, the company obfuscates the fact that the really valuable data comes from your interactions with your service providers and others. The notion that your phone is the digital equivalent of your filing cabinet is a convenient illusion. Companies actually care little about your personal data; that is why they can pretend to lock it in a box. The value lies in the inferences drawn from your interactions, which are also stored on your phone—but that data does not belong to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s acquisition of Fitbit is another example. Google promises “not to use Fitbit data for advertising,” but the lucrative predictions Google needs aren’t dependent on individual data. <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/googlefitbit-will-monetise-health-data-and-harm-consumers\">As a group of European economists argue</a>d in a recent paper put out by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a think tank in London, “it is enough for Google to correlate aggregate health outcomes with non-health outcomes for even a subset of Fitbit users that did not opt out from some use of using their data, to then predict health outcomes (and thus ad targeting possibilities) for&nbsp;all&nbsp;non-Fitbit users (billions of them).” The Google-Fitbit deal is essentially a group data deal. It positions Google in a key market for heath data while enabling it to triangulate different data sets and make money from the inferences used by health and insurance markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What policymakers must do</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Draft bills have sought to fill this gap in the United States. In 2019 Senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden introduced an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2231\">Algorithmic Accountability Act</a>, which subsequently stalled in Congress. The act would have required firms to undertake algorithmic impact assessments in certain situations to check for bias or discrimination. But in the US this crucial issue is more likely to be taken up first in laws applying to specific sectors such as health care, where the danger of algorithmic bias has been magnified by the pandemic’s disparate impacts on US population groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late January, the <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/5/protecting-civil-liberties-during-covid-19-warner-blumental-eshoo-schakowsky-delbene-introduce-the-public-health-privacy-act\">Public Health Emergency Privacy Act</a> was reintroduced to the Senate and House of Representatives by Senators Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal. This act would ensure that data collected for public health purposes is not used for any other purpose. It would prohibit the use of health data for discriminatory, unrelated, or intrusive purposes, including commercial advertising, e-commerce, or efforts to control access to employment, finance, insurance, housing, or education. This would be a great start. Going further, a law that applies to all algorithmic decision making should, inspired by the French example, focus on hard accountability, strong regulatory oversight of data-driven decision making, and the ability to audit and inspect algorithmic decisions and their impact on society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three elements are needed to ensure hard accountability: (1) clear transparency about where and when automated decisions take place and how they affect people and groups, (2) the public’s right to offer meaningful input and call on those in authority to justify their decisions, and (3) the ability to enforce sanctions. Crucially, policymakers will need to decide, as has been recently suggested in the EU, what constitutes a “high risk” algorithm that should meet a higher standard of scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clear Transparency</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus should be on public scrutiny of automated decision making and the types of transparency that lead to accountability. This includes revealing the existence of algorithms, their purpose, and the training data behind them, as well as their impacts—whether they have led to disparate outcomes, and on which groups if so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Public participation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The public has a fundamental right to call on those in power to justify their decisions. This “right to demand answers” should not be limited to consultative participation, where people are asked for their input and officials move on. It should include empowered participation, where public input is mandated prior to the rollout of high-risks algorithms in both the public and private sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sanctions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Finally, the power to sanction is key for these reforms to succeed and for accountability to be achieved. It should be mandatory to establish auditing requirements for data targeting, verification, and curation, to equip auditors with this baseline knowledge, and to empower oversight bodies to enforce sanctions, not only to remedy harm after the fact but to prevent it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue of collective data-driven harms affects everyone. A Public Health Emergency Privacy Act is a first step. Congress should then use the lessons from implementing that act to develop laws that focus specifically on collective data rights. Only through such action can the US avoid situations where inferences drawn from the data companies collect haunt people’s ability to access housing, jobs, credit, and other opportunities for years to come.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Every person engaged with the networked world constantly creates rivers of data.

As a group of European economists argued in a recent paper put out by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a think tank in London, “it is enough for Google to correlate aggregate health outcomes with non-health outcomes for even a subset of Fitbit users that did not opt out from some use of using their data, to then predict health outcomes (and thus ad targeting possibilities) for all non-Fitbit users (billions of them).” The Google-Fitbit deal is essentially a group data deal. It positions Google in a key market for heath data while enabling it to triangulate different data sets and make money from the inferences used by health and insurance markets.\nWhat policymakers must do\nDraft bills have sought to fill this gap in the United States. In 2019 Senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden introduced an Algorithmic Accountability Act, which subsequently stalled in Congress. The act would have required firms to undertake algorithmic impact assessments in certain situations to check for bias or discrimination. But in the US this crucial issue is more likely to be taken up first in laws applying to specific sectors such as health care, where the danger of algorithmic bias has been magnified by the pandemic’s disparate impacts on US population groups.\nIn late January, the Public Health Emergency Privacy Act was reintroduced to the Senate and House of Representatives by Senators Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal. This act would ensure that data collected for public health purposes is not used for any other purpose. It would prohibit the use of health data for discriminatory, unrelated, or intrusive purposes, including commercial advertising, e-commerce, or efforts to control access to employment, finance, insurance, housing, or education. This would be a great start. Going further, a law that applies to all algorithmic decision making should, inspired by the French example, focus on hard accountability, strong regulatory oversight of data-driven decision making, and the ability to audit and inspect algorithmic decisions and their impact on society.\nThree elements are needed to ensure hard accountability: (1) clear transparency about where and when automated decisions take place and how they affect people and groups, (2) the public’s right to offer meaningful input and call on those in authority to justify their decisions, and (3) the ability to enforce sanctions. Crucially, policymakers will need to decide, as has been recently suggested in the EU, what constitutes a “high risk” algorithm that should meet a higher standard of scrutiny.\nClear Transparency\nThe focus should be on public scrutiny of automated decision making and the types of transparency that lead to accountability. This includes revealing the existence of algorithms, their purpose, and the training data behind them, as well as their impacts—whether they have led to disparate outcomes, and on which groups if so.\nPublic participation\nThe public has a fundamental right to call on those in power to justify their decisions. This “right to demand answers” should not be limited to consultative participation, where people are asked for their input and officials move on. It should include empowered participation, where public input is mandated prior to the rollout of high-risks algorithms in both the public and private sectors.\nSanctions\nFinally, the power to sanction is key for these reforms to succeed and for accountability to be achieved. It should be mandatory to establish auditing requirements for data targeting, verification, and curation, to equip auditors with this baseline knowledge, and to empower oversight bodies to enforce sanctions, not only to remedy harm after the fact but to prevent it.\nThe issue of collective data-driven harms affects everyone. A Public Health Emergency Privacy Act is a first step. Congress should then use the lessons from implementing that act to develop laws that focus specifically on collective data rights. Only through such action can the US avoid situations where inferences drawn from the data companies collect haunt people’s ability to access housing, jobs, credit, and other opportunities for years to come.","dc:creator":"Martin Tisne","content":"Every person engaged with the networked world constantly creates rivers of data.

For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to avoid complex process diagrams with decision points and flow charts. Instead, the popular double diamond framework provides us with a simple illustration of how an idea best progresses from concept to a real, working product or venture.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tju3cwSB78mjbdus.png\" /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond\">Double Diamond</a> is a process developed by the Design Council of the UK. It combines divergent thinking (exploring an issue widely) and convergent thinking to understand the problem, use these insights to define a solution, develop a solution then deliver a solution (put it into action).</p><p>Most organisations use some variation of this to work ideas from a few lines on a piece of paper to something being used by customers and earning revenue (or results).</p><p>Most of the time a new idea will need multiple iterations around this loop. For various reasons, many organisations can struggle with iterations (e.g. fear of failure, budget or governance process).</p><p>When someone is submitting ideas to a product or venture team, they’re coming in at the Discover step. You need to help them understand the problem in order to get to the next step. Most people unfamiliar with these techniques jump straight to develop mode (“I already know what we need to do, can you just build it?”).</p><h3>Why Start with Discovery?</h3><p>You need to start with a Discovery because this is <em>the</em> process for understanding the problem and the customer. It’s a way of explicitly stating your assumptions. This is the foundation that any successful venture, product or idea is built on.</p><p>If you find yourself saying “ <a href=\"https://terem.tech/when-knowing-your-customers-best-isnt-beneficial/\">I understand the customer</a> “, “I already understand the problem” or “I already know what we need” then, I can tell you now you are wrong. This comes from hard-won, expensive experience that I’ve learnt too often. The people and companies with the best understanding of their customer always say they don’t understand their customers enough, those that lack it always says they know what their customers need.</p><p>You can find a more detailed explanation of <a href=\"https://terem.tech/why-do-product-discovery/\">why Discovery is the essential foundation for any product or venture here</a>. Including a list of the benefits, risks for skipping it and false reasons people give for why it isn’t needed.</p><h3>Why Focus on The Customer and Their Problem First?</h3><p>The reason why you focus on the customer (or citizen!) and their problem first is because, at the end of the day, this is where a product succeeds or fails. You need to solve a problem.</p><p>As a non-product person, helping your product or venture team understand the customer problem is where you can add an immense amount of value, especially because you are probably closer to the customer than they are.</p><p>The focus on this, really getting this right, is far more important in the early stages of the process than market size, solutions and, even business models. If you understand the problem well, everything else can fall into place and be designed around it. If you get it wrong, then you’ll forever be trying to make up for it, often in an unnecessarily expensive way.</p><h3>What to Expect From Discovery</h3><p>When you are doing a discovery, you will likely start with the idea that you think is amazing. Then you’ll begin to explicitly stating your assumptions and interviewing customers. You are going to start learning things about the problem, about your assumptions and your customers that you had not considered.</p><p>If you’re doing it right, you will almost certainly change direction. You’ll either completely change your thinking, or you’ll make adjustments.</p><p>Follow the problem and your research, not your biases and initial assumptions.</p><p>You’ll come to the end of your discovery activities and be faced with <a href=\"https://terem.tech/end-of-discovery-decisions-what-to-do-next/\">an end of Discovery decision</a>. You’ll need to consider this before you go ahead and take it to the group that decides whether to proceed or not (it’s usually some kind of committee or executive group, but in smaller companies, it might be an individual).</p><h3>Key Concepts to Know</h3><p>There are a few concepts to consider when working through a Discovery. The list below is a refined list selected for non-product people working through the process of getting their idea up.</p><ol><li><strong>Recognise the realities of large companies</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>New ideas carry high uncertainty that large companies aren’t used to. Be aware of this and how to deal with it, don’t get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to provide certainty where it isn’t possible.</li><li>There are corporate forces that work against new products and ventures. Be aware of them, address them head-on.</li><li>Corporations get distracted by market size. It’s not always the right way to think early on with an idea.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Understand how product development is approached beyond discovery</strong> — start with the <a href=\"https://terem.tech/principles-of-product/\">principles of a product-led approach</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Focus on customers at the start of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle</strong>: Early on, you want and need to focus on customers that will be innovators. The ones that will be ok with early versions of your product, early versions that have less features because they feel the pain strongly and are willing to take some risk. Only once you are succeeding with them will you consider expanding the product to meet the needs of later adopters.</p><h3>How a Decision to Proceed Will be Made</h3><p>Finally, you want to have some understanding of how a decision will be made about whether your idea proceeds to whatever the next step in your organisation’s process is.</p><p>Most companies will have a framework or some criteria. Get this ahead of time.</p><p>Then make sure your pitch for proceeding focuses on why it’s worth proceeding to the next stage rather than why you need to Go-to-Market now. It’s easy to get diverted by solutions, market sizing and trends, but it’s usually so early in the evolution of the idea that the idea is easily rejected because it carries too many assumptions or risks.</p><p>Instead, focus on what you have with your newly gained understanding of the customer and the problem. Pitch to address the assumptions you have and outline possible solutions to the problem.</p><p>When it comes to the pitch itself, after we’ve debated the idea, I personally find it beneficial to focus everyone <a href=\"https://terem.tech/4-questions-product-venture-executives-must-focus-on/\">on four key questions</a>:</p><ol><li>Do we want to be in this space?</li><li>Is this a <em>good enough</em> idea in the space?</li><li>What’s the <em>single biggest</em> assumption we need to address?</li><li>Does this proposed next step address this assumption?</li></ol><h3>Discovery Tools for Non-product People</h3><p>The key tools that a non-product person needs to run a <em>good enough</em> Discovery are:</p><ol><li>Customer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas</li><li>Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)</li><li>Business Model Canvas</li></ol><p>Other tools like wireframing or prototyping tools were considered but have explicitly been omitted. These tools send people inexperienced with discovery too far down the solution path and become distractions from them focusing on the problem and the customer.</p><p>Tools for market sizing and complex financial analysis have also been explicitly omitted. These activities distract from focusing on real customer problems.</p><p>The tools that have been listed really focus the mind on the customer, the customer’s problem, the commercial opportunity and the viability of that opportunity. In the early stages, rough answers and hypotheses are acceptable: perfect is the enemy of done and progress.</p><p>Below is a brief overview of each tool.</p><h4><a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas\">Customer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas</a></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/598/0*2o-07jgufO2sSDVy.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.b2binternational.com/research/methods/faq/what-is-the-value-proposition-canvas/\">B2B International</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Jobs-to-be-Done</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s4YBlRcjs0dnriTL.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb\">Jobs-to-be-Done.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Learn <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-master-your-customers-needs-using-jtbd/\">how to master Jobs-to-be-Done to understand your customer in this article</a>.</p><h4>Business Model Canvas</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rM1m1garVzSRV2Si.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas\">Strategyzer</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Discovery Skills for Non-product People</h3><p>Now that people are armed with the background knowledge, you can work through the foundational skills and tools for doing a discovery:</p><ol><li>How to run early customer interviews:<br>- <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-run-early-customer-interviews/\">A step-by-step guide</a><br>- <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-conduct-excellent-customer-interviews/\">A video on running the interviews themselves</a></li><li><a href=\"https://terem.tech/blog/validate-new-products-features-landing-page-experiments/\">How to use landing page experiments to quickly understand customer behaviour</a></li><li><a href=\"https://terem.tech/6-steps-to-validate-jtbd-with-surveys/\">Surveys to validate Jobs-to-be-Done</a></li></ol><h3>Closing Thoughts &amp; Clarifications</h3><p>There is a lot of knowledge, skills and tools that have been explicitly avoided, anything to do with solutions, market sizing and financials.

It was early February, and vaccine appointments were scarce, so Schaffer, who was already vaccinated herself, was volunteering her time to help friends, family, and even strangers secure their shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had read stories about people across the country stumbling upon vaccines that were about to expire: on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/us/oregon-vaccine-stuck-in-the-snow-drivers.html\">a highway in Oregon</a> during a snowstorm, or at <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@justlydeserved/video/6912929016932568325\">pharmacies</a> at the end of the day. And so when she heard about Dr. B, a new website which offered to notify people of waitlisted covid vaccines available nearby, it seemed worth a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company had a simple proposition: provide your information, and Dr. B would scour the listings of vaccine providers nearby to find extra doses that needed to be used up. If there was a match, the patient would receive a text and get 15 minutes to reserve the shot. The service asked those signing up to give their name, zip code, date of birth, email, phone number, and type of work and to flag up any medical conditions such as asthma, cancer, or pregnancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Schaffer’s contacts was a 70-something man from Brooklyn who had cancer and was eligible for vaccination but couldn’t find an appointment. “I signed up for Dr. B out of desperation,” Schaffer says: she got a message telling her the man was number 10,891 on Dr. B’s list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within weeks, that number had ballooned into the millions, thanks to coverage in the New York Times, Bloomberg, Time, and elsewhere—all emphasizing Dr. B’s promise to play matchmaker between sites with leftover doses and Americans desperate for a shot. (Today, it claims that nearly 2.5 million people have signed up for the service.) And people <em>were</em> desperate: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/30/1017086/cdc-44-million-vaccine-data-vams-problems/\">appointment websites were breaking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/01/1016725/people-are-building-their-own-vaccine-appointment-tools/\">some people were crowdsourcing their way to vaccination</a>, and headlines suggested the country was in a race between vaccines and dangerous new variants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screenshot-dr-b-covid.png?w=682\" alt=\"Text message welcoming user to Dr B service\" class=\"wp-image-1025293\" width=\"359\" height=\"312\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But for Schaffer, the whole thing was just an exercise in false hope. Dr. B did not alert her to any standby appointments, so she carried on searching manually and eventually found the man an appointment herself. It was only on April 1, weeks after he had already gotten vaccinated, that she finally heard back from the service—and even then it didn’t offer an appointment but just the possibility of one. “You have a 50% chance of receiving an alert for a dose tomorrow,” the text message read. “Are you available tomorrow to get the COVID vaccine?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By that time, though, vaccine appointments were abundant, and all New Yorkers over 30 were eligible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of the notification perplexed her, but it turns out that it was far from unusual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I searched for people who had used Dr. B to actually receive a vaccination. I made phone calls to and exchanged messages with people who had signed up. I scoured online forums and neighborhood groups across the country. But after weeks of looking, I was unable to identify a single individual who successfully got a shot through the service. Instead, I heard from dozens of people all over the country who signed up but only received notice of available vaccines long after they had already been vaccinated elsewhere, as well as many others who say they were never contacted by the company after initial registration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen Menendez, a moderator of a popular New York City Facebook group with nearly 10,000 members that acts as a hub for covid-19 information, says she’s seen discussion of Dr. B but has yet to encounter anyone who got a vaccine through the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology forged during this global health crisis—from <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/23/1016820/telemedicine-zoom-doctor-online-health-care/\">video calling</a> to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017803/digital-contact-tracing-app-covid/\">contact tracing apps</a> to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/26/1002191/how-show-a-coronavirus-vaccine-prevents-covid-19/\">vaccines themselves</a>—has faced a special set of challenges. Systems often needed to be spun up quickly, in high-visibility environments, and with lives at stake. Under such pressures, few of these technologies have succeeded completely, and many have failed to live up to expectations. Building services to help people when they are at their most vulnerable <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/17/1020811/better-tech-government-pandemic-united-states/\">is not easy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more, I asked Dr. B itself how many people it had gotten vaccinated. But after a series of verbal and written requests, and in an interview with its founder, Dr. B refused to say how many vaccines it had helped deliver, or to offer any other measure of success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was left wondering: Did Dr. B achieve what it set out to do? And what is the company doing with its huge list of people’s names, locations, contact information, and health conditions?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The “national” waitlist</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When he was touting Dr. B to the press shortly after starting the company in January 2021, founder Cyrus Massoumi explained what inspired him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I had this idea, reading all the articles,” Massoumi, a serial entrepreneur, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/algorithms-match-vaccine-seekers-with-soon-to-be-wasted-doses\">told Bloomberg in March</a>. “Why is there not a nationwide standby system that any provider could use that would effectively reallocate the vaccine?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. B was his answer to that question. The service doesn’t provide vaccines itself; instead, it relies on partnerships with official vaccination sites, which then notify it when they expect to have leftover doses. The company says it uses an algorithm to comb through its list of eligible nearby users and give them the option of reserving a dose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brittany Marsh, the owner and pharmacist of Cornerstone Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first provider to sign on to work with Dr. B. She was introduced to the company through a mutual friend who knew Chelsea Clinton, a friend of Massoumi’s, she says. Company representatives flew to Arkansas to test the service and had it up and running “in record timing,” Marsh says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were making calls and trying to get people in the door to save the shots in arms before they expired,” she says. Though the pharmacy wasn’t wasting any doses at the time, “it definitely made our life easier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In interviews given by Massoumi at the time, he talked about building a national network of providers. But when the company went on its publicity blitz in March, Marsh’s pharmacy was just one of two vaccination sites in the entire country that the company had agreements with. (The other was a vaccine hub in <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/want-join-vaccine-standby-list-national-signup-just-launched-queens\">Queens, New York</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users were encouraged to sign up wherever they lived, but Dr. B did not tell them whether it had partnerships with vaccinators in their state or zip code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The company has continued to promote the idea of a nationwide service, with online posts claiming the service “is available in all 50 states.” When asked exactly how large its network is, Massoumi told MIT Technology Review that Dr. B does not have nationwide coverage but has around 600 vaccination partners across 37 states—although the company declined to say who they are, or which states it is active in. And those partnerships do not include national-level agreements with major chains such as CVS or Walgreens, which both said they were not working with Dr. B at a corporate level, though Massoumi says some individual stores are Dr. B providers.

With all these developments, it’s become harder for consumers and patients to differentiate between public pandemic response and for-profit entities. Crowdsourced resource lists regularly mention Dr. B’s waitlist signup, for example, alongside official public health websites, the federally operated Vaccines.gov, notices from health-care providers, and other medical services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But public health departments and private companies have different reasons for existing, even if the stated missions sound similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The incentives are the opposite,” says Elizabeth Renieris, a tech and human rights fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center. “Public health and public interest concerns traditionally are not driven by profit or growth, or speed or efficiency, or any of those values.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The famous saying in business is, if you’re not paying, you’re the product,” says Kayte Spector-Bagdady, associate director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine at the University of Michigan. “Weight tracker apps will help you track your weight, or fertility applications will help track your cycle. But the business model is really being able to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health-privacy/what-your-period-tracker-app-knows-about-you/\">sell that data</a> out the back end.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rules in place under HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, intended to stop oversharing of health data. But if a company is not one of the “covered entities,” then the rules don’t apply, and there is a well-established business model for private health companies that relies on collecting consumer health data and selling it or sharing it with third parties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The vast majority of these private-sector companies providing these tools are not going to be HIPAA-covered entities,” Renieris says. “It’s this displacement of the public interest by the private sector.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Dr. B itself does not provide care, it is one of those entities not covered by HIPAA, and the data it collects falls outside the law’s protections. That means when people sign up for Dr. B’s services, their health information is not protected by HIPAA, but by whatever is outlined in the site’s privacy policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FAQ section of Dr. B’s website says that thanks to its staff’s “decades” of experience dealing with HIPAA, it voluntarily adheres to those standards when storing and sharing user data, including encrypting the information. And its privacy policy does lay out some comprehensive-sounding protections. The website <a href=\"https://hidrb.com/faq\">says</a> it does not sell information that would identify people, and only shares users’ personal information with providers once they’ve opted in to receive a vaccine nearby. It also gives users the option to request that their personal data be deleted by sending a sequence of text messages to the service (although that fact is found halfway down the privacy policy page, and couched in legalese).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the policy also gives Dr. B the right to use personal data internally for purposes other than vaccinations and, if the company gets bought, to transfer the data to the new owner. The company declined to say what happens to information from users who opt out of vaccine notifications, and its policy is equally silent on the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such collected information can be lucrative. The zip code you live in and whether you have asthma can be valuable for advertisers marketing treatments; private or industry-sponsored researchers looking to recruit study participants might want a list of people with autoimmune disorders. And though many Americans are used to giving up data in the age of invasive tracking by tech giants, Spector-Bagdady says health data is different from, say, information on what kinds of clothes you like to wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are only so many pairs of mom jeans that I can purchase, but if you have health data from millions of people who have insurance, to whom you can advertise and target very expensive drugs that the insurance will cover, then you’re into some really profitable areas in terms of drug development, drug marketing, algorithmic and machine-learning developments,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Dr. B users I spoke to said that they expect information about themselves to be shared among private companies. But others said they were so desperate to protect themselves and loved ones that they didn’t even consider what information they were handing over when they signed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renieris says it’s hard enough in normal times to ask people to investigate every digital interaction to make sure they know what they’re signing up for and who they’re giving their data to. Add in the fear and urgency of a pandemic and it’s even more of a burden on the consumer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You begin to sign up for anything at that stage,” says Menendez, the Facebook group administrator. “I think that logic kind of goes out of the window.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Going straight to the source</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Without any evidence that Dr. B was successfully rerouting leftover doses, I still had questions, so I contacted the company to organize a conversation with its founder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 17, I interviewed Massoumi over Google Meet. He was accompanied by his communications team, including at least one representative from a public relations firm specializing in crisis communications. During the course of our conversation, Massoumi talked about learning from Dr. B’s “highly scalable” system and said that the company had a commitment to equitable distribution of vaccines, but he refused to say how many patients had been vaccinated through Dr. B.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the company was happy to publish the number of signups it had on its website, he claimed that revealing vaccination numbers would violate user privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Massoumi said Dr. B is committed to data privacy, reiterating the company’s claim that its staff’s previous experience with HIPAA means it understands how to protect user data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Just because we’re not a covered entity under HIPAA doesn’t mean that we can’t hold our service providers to high standards of patient privacy,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has already navigated the transfer of user data on at least one occasion. When Vax Standby, the competing covid-19 vaccine waitlist, announced it was ceasing operations and merging with Dr. B, Vax Standby’s founders publicly promised to keep user data separate and not to automatically place its subscribers on Dr. B’s waitlist. Massoumi said he respected Vax Standby’s move, but that it wasn’t ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t think that was in the public health interest,” he said. “I think many of those people could have benefited from the platform that we built.” (He added that Vax Standby user data was eventually deleted without being transferred.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Dr. B users had told me that data sharing was an issue for them only in hindsight. They said how panicked they had become as vaccination slots seemed nonexistent, and how little attention they paid to the personal information they were handing over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I appreciate the fact that if perhaps an evil person was running this company, that they could do a lot of evil things in the world,” Massoumi said. “I assure you, that’s not my reason for doing this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Massoumi more questions about how desperation may have driven people to sign up for services without scrutinizing them. But he began discussing a different topic instead: the number of Americans who do not have health insurance. When pressed, Massoumi ended the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t have time to get into it with you,” he said before leaving the call.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“A bizarre attempt”</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After our interview, I sent a list of 20 questions to Dr. B representatives to request more information. My queries revolved around the company’s basic business model, its activities, and its privacy policies—and included a request for key details that Massoumi had earlier said he would provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building new technologies is a hard job that has been dramatically complicated by the pandemic, but these were typical questions about its operations that any startup might expect. We asked how many vaccine notifications the company had sent out; how many people had received a vaccine through the service; and whether it had consulted with health-care providers about the service’s usefulness. We also asked what the business model for this free service was, and whether it would seek outside funding in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. B refused to share even basic information about its operations. Instead, the company sent back the following statement, claiming that our inquiries were a “bizarre attempt” to question Dr. B’s attempts to get people vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Dr. B was created during the height of the covid-19 crisis with the clear mission to save lives by rapidly getting vaccines into as many arms as possible because too many vaccines go to waste,” it said. “This important effort reflects the need to make vaccine distribution efficient and equitable and meet the urgent needs of underserved communities to help bring the pandemic to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are proud to have helped nearly 2.5 million people sign up for notifications about immediately available vaccines through hundreds of providers nationwide. So we are entirely flummoxed by this bizarre attempt to treat such a civic-minded endeavor as anything other than a genuine and committed effort to remove barriers that prevent people from getting vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“From day one we understood the importance of protecting users’ data and that is why we have developed robust policies and practices to keep their information private and secure. Our privacy policy makes it clear that user data is never rented, sold or shared with any third party inappropriately. As a completely opt-in service, users have the ability to permanently delete their data from Dr. B at any time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Solving a temporary problem?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that Dr. B tapped into a very real issue when it launched: at the time, finding an available appointment was impossible for <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/03/1017245/broadband-digital-divide-senior-citizens-pandemic/\">all but the most internet savvy or well-connected</a>. With so many people struggling to get a vaccine, even whispers of <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/it-wasnt-hoax-what-really-happened-brooklyn-army-terminal-vaccination-site\">leftover doses</a> that might be trashed were enough to cause anger and confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manual and digital systems started to proliferate to address the issue: pharmacies set up their own paper waitlists, and alongside Dr. B and Vax Standby, there were digital services like VaccinateCA, a crowdsourced effort to spot open slots in California, and TurboVax, a viral Twitter bot that shared available appointments online as they dropped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, stories of leftover—or, worse, wasted—vaccines were a particularly painful and visible example of health systems failing. But as vaccine supplies expanded, that moment quickly passed. Hannan, of the Association of Immunization Managers, says waste has actually been minimal compared with what’s accepted in other mass vaccination initiatives. The federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides kids with shots regardless of their family’s ability to pay, has an expected wastage rate of 5%, she says. <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/cvs-and-walgreens-have-wasted-more-vaccine-doses-than-most-states-combined/\">Data about covid vaccines obtained</a> by Kaiser Health News, meanwhile, show that the CDC recorded 182,874 covid vaccines thrown out in the first three months vaccinations were available—just 0.1% of the more than 147.6 million doses administered as of March 30. According to CDC data, 70% of recorded covid-19 vaccine wastage happened at CVS and Walgreens—both companies that confirmed they have no national-level partnerships with Dr. B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As vaccines have grown easier to access, some broker services have shuttered. Cities like Philadelphia are <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly-tips/covid-vaccine-list-removal-philadelphia-suburbs-20210420.html\">asking residents</a> to take themselves off local lists, and TurboVax, the Twitter bot, announced on May 11 that it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/turbovax/status/1392089130599862280\">winding down</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The willingness of people to help strangers find vaccines—like Joanie Schaffer, the volunteer who tried using Dr. B to help people in New York, and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/21/1023212/epicenter-is-a-vaccine-matchmaker-in-new-york-city/\">other community</a> efforts—has been a small sliver of hope in an otherwise terrible year. And those who have benefited from such kindness have made their gratitude known. When TurboVax creator Huge Ma <a href=\"https://twitter.com/turbovax/status/1392089130599862280\">said</a> he was closing the service, he was overwhelmed by thousands of tweets, retweets, and responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thank you for everything you did for the community,” said one follower. “Thank you for helping my wife and me get our first shots!” wrote another. (Indeed, TurboVax followers showed their appreciation by raising more than $200,000 for small businesses in New York’s Chinatown when Ma asked for help amid rising anti-Asian violence.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drbisin\">Dr. B’s feed</a> for similar expressions of thanks from grateful, vaccinated users, and found none. But unlike its peers, the company has no plans to shut down even though the appointment crunch has largely passed. Instead, Massoumi and the company say they are looking to what comes next. He says maybe they’ll collaborate with mobile vaccination clinics, or focus on booster shots. And now that the vaccination chaos has largely passed in the US? He wants to take Dr. B overseas. After all, he told me during our interview, the US effort has come so far. “We’ve touched millions of people,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/covid-pandemic-tech\">Pandemic Technology Project</a>, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.</em></p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"When Joanie Schaffer heard about Dr. B, a free covid-19 vaccine standby service, she was running out of options. It was early February, and vaccine appointments were scarce, so Schaffer, who was already vaccinated herself, was volunteering her time to help friends, family, and even strangers secure their shots.\nShe had read stories about people across the country stumbling upon vaccines that were about to expire: on a highway in Oregon during a snowstorm, or at pharmacies at the end of the day. And so when she heard about Dr. B, a new website which offered to notify people of waitlisted covid vaccines available nearby, it seemed worth a try.\nThe company had a simple proposition: provide your information, and Dr. B would scour the listings of vaccine providers nearby to find extra doses that needed to be used up. If there was a match, the patient would receive a text and get 15 minutes to reserve the shot. The service asked those signing up to give their name, zip code, date of birth, email, phone number, and type of work and to flag up any medical conditions such as asthma, cancer, or pregnancy.\nOne of Schaffer’s contacts was a 70-something man from Brooklyn who had cancer and was eligible for vaccination but couldn’t find an appointment. “I signed up for Dr. B out of desperation,” Schaffer says: she got a message telling her the man was number 10,891 on Dr. B’s list. \nWithin weeks, that number had ballooned into the millions, thanks to coverage in the New York Times, Bloomberg, Time, and elsewhere—all emphasizing Dr. B’s promise to play matchmaker between sites with leftover doses and Americans desperate for a shot. (Today, it claims that nearly 2.5 million people have signed up for the service.) And people were desperate: appointment websites were breaking, some people were crowdsourcing their way to vaccination, and headlines suggested the country was in a race between vaccines and dangerous new variants. \n\nBut for Schaffer, the whole thing was just an exercise in false hope. Dr. B did not alert her to any standby appointments, so she carried on searching manually and eventually found the man an appointment herself. It was only on April 1, weeks after he had already gotten vaccinated, that she finally heard back from the service—and even then it didn’t offer an appointment but just the possibility of one. “You have a 50% chance of receiving an alert for a dose tomorrow,” the text message read. “Are you available tomorrow to get the COVID vaccine?”\nBy that time, though, vaccine appointments were abundant, and all New Yorkers over 30 were eligible. \nThe timing of the notification perplexed her, but it turns out that it was far from unusual. \nI searched for people who had used Dr. B to actually receive a vaccination. I made phone calls to and exchanged messages with people who had signed up. I scoured online forums and neighborhood groups across the country. But after weeks of looking, I was unable to identify a single individual who successfully got a shot through the service. Instead, I heard from dozens of people all over the country who signed up but only received notice of available vaccines long after they had already been vaccinated elsewhere, as well as many others who say they were never contacted by the company after initial registration. \nKaren Menendez, a moderator of a popular New York City Facebook group with nearly 10,000 members that acts as a hub for covid-19 information, says she’s seen discussion of Dr. B but has yet to encounter anyone who got a vaccine through the company.\nThe technology forged during this global health crisis—from video calling to contact tracing apps to vaccines themselves—has faced a special set of challenges. Systems often needed to be spun up quickly, in high-visibility environments, and with lives at stake. Under such pressures, few of these technologies have succeeded completely, and many have failed to live up to expectations. Building services to help people when they are at their most vulnerable is not easy. \nTo find out more, I asked Dr. B itself how many people it had gotten vaccinated. But after a series of verbal and written requests, and in an interview with its founder, Dr. B refused to say how many vaccines it had helped deliver, or to offer any other measure of success. \nSo I was left wondering: Did Dr. B achieve what it set out to do? And what is the company doing with its huge list of people’s names, locations, contact information, and health conditions?\nThe “national” waitlist\nWhen he was touting Dr. B to the press shortly after starting the company in January 2021, founder Cyrus Massoumi explained what inspired him.\n“I had this idea, reading all the articles,” Massoumi, a serial entrepreneur, told Bloomberg in March. “Why is there not a nationwide standby system that any provider could use that would effectively reallocate the vaccine?”\nDr. B was his answer to that question. The service doesn’t provide vaccines itself; instead, it relies on partnerships with official vaccination sites, which then notify it when they expect to have leftover doses. The company says it uses an algorithm to comb through its list of eligible nearby users and give them the option of reserving a dose. \nBrittany Marsh, the owner and pharmacist of Cornerstone Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first provider to sign on to work with Dr. B. She was introduced to the company through a mutual friend who knew Chelsea Clinton, a friend of Massoumi’s, she says. Company representatives flew to Arkansas to test the service and had it up and running “in record timing,” Marsh says.\n“We were making calls and trying to get people in the door to save the shots in arms before they expired,” she says. Though the pharmacy wasn’t wasting any doses at the time, “it definitely made our life easier.”\nIn interviews given by Massoumi at the time, he talked about building a national network of providers. But when the company went on its publicity blitz in March, Marsh’s pharmacy was just one of two vaccination sites in the entire country that the company had agreements with. (The other was a vaccine hub in Queens, New York.) \nUsers were encouraged to sign up wherever they lived, but Dr. B did not tell them whether it had partnerships with vaccinators in their state or zip code. \nThe company has continued to promote the idea of a nationwide service, with online posts claiming the service “is available in all 50 states.” When asked exactly how large its network is, Massoumi told MIT Technology Review that Dr. B does not have nationwide coverage but has around 600 vaccination partners across 37 states—although the company declined to say who they are, or which states it is active in. And those partnerships do not include national-level agreements with major chains such as CVS or Walgreens, which both said they were not working with Dr. B at a corporate level, though Massoumi says some individual stores are Dr. B providers. Six hundred partners may seem extensive, but it accounts for less than 1% of the more than 80,000 US vaccination sites tracked by the CDC. \nDr. B’s limited presence may come as a surprise, given its founder’s experience in digital health services. Massoumi previously cofounded Zocdoc, a popular online appointment search and booking site, and served as its CEO. He left Zocdoc in 2015 and went on to start Shadow, an app that helps reunite lost pets with their owners. While Dr. B—which Massoumi says he is funding himself—does not charge either users or partners for its services, it now has at least 56 employees, including a team of 30 organizers, most with a background in politics. In February it expanded even further, acquiring another waitlisting service, Vax Standby.\nDespite this heavy investment, however, Dr. B’s footprint is apparently so small that Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, which represents and coordinates state vaccine campaigns across the entire country, says she was not even aware of Dr. B until she was interviewed for this story. In fact, says Hannan, the entire idea of a digitized waitlisting service is one that overwhelmed vaccination sites would have found hard to adopt.\n“Getting providers to use a new reporting system or a new scheduling system, a new IT interface—that’s much more of a challenge than getting them to agree to accept and give the vaccine,” she says.\nPrivate data vs. public health\nDr. B is one of many private efforts that we’ve seen emerge to fill the gaps in America’s health system, from the private covid-19 testing sites that have overtaken strip malls to health-care tech companies entrusted to schedule vaccine appointments. With all these developments, it’s become harder for consumers and patients to differentiate between public pandemic response and for-profit entities. Crowdsourced resource lists regularly mention Dr. B’s waitlist signup, for example, alongside official public health websites, the federally operated Vaccines.gov, notices from health-care providers, and other medical services.\nBut public health departments and private companies have different reasons for existing, even if the stated missions sound similar.\n“The incentives are the opposite,” says Elizabeth Renieris, a tech and human rights fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center. “Public health and public interest concerns traditionally are not driven by profit or growth, or speed or efficiency, or any of those values.”\n“The famous saying in business is, if you’re not paying, you’re the product,” says Kayte Spector-Bagdady, associate director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine at the University of Michigan. “Weight tracker apps will help you track your weight, or fertility applications will help track your cycle.

So we are entirely flummoxed by this bizarre attempt to treat such a civic-minded endeavor as anything other than a genuine and committed effort to remove barriers that prevent people from getting vaccinated.\n“From day one we understood the importance of protecting users’ data and that is why we have developed robust policies and practices to keep their information private and secure. Our privacy policy makes it clear that user data is never rented, sold or shared with any third party inappropriately. As a completely opt-in service, users have the ability to permanently delete their data from Dr. B at any time.”\nSolving a temporary problem?\nThere is no doubt that Dr. B tapped into a very real issue when it launched: at the time, finding an available appointment was impossible for all but the most internet savvy or well-connected. With so many people struggling to get a vaccine, even whispers of leftover doses that might be trashed were enough to cause anger and confusion.\nManual and digital systems started to proliferate to address the issue: pharmacies set up their own paper waitlists, and alongside Dr. B and Vax Standby, there were digital services like VaccinateCA, a crowdsourced effort to spot open slots in California, and TurboVax, a viral Twitter bot that shared available appointments online as they dropped.\nFor many people, stories of leftover—or, worse, wasted—vaccines were a particularly painful and visible example of health systems failing. But as vaccine supplies expanded, that moment quickly passed. Hannan, of the Association of Immunization Managers, says waste has actually been minimal compared with what’s accepted in other mass vaccination initiatives. The federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides kids with shots regardless of their family’s ability to pay, has an expected wastage rate of 5%, she says. Data about covid vaccines obtained by Kaiser Health News, meanwhile, show that the CDC recorded 182,874 covid vaccines thrown out in the first three months vaccinations were available—just 0.1% of the more than 147.6 million doses administered as of March 30. According to CDC data, 70% of recorded covid-19 vaccine wastage happened at CVS and Walgreens—both companies that confirmed they have no national-level partnerships with Dr. B.\nAs vaccines have grown easier to access, some broker services have shuttered. Cities like Philadelphia are asking residents to take themselves off local lists, and TurboVax, the Twitter bot, announced on May 11 that it was winding down.\nThe willingness of people to help strangers find vaccines—like Joanie Schaffer, the volunteer who tried using Dr. B to help people in New York, and other community efforts—has been a small sliver of hope in an otherwise terrible year. And those who have benefited from such kindness have made their gratitude known. When TurboVax creator Huge Ma said he was closing the service, he was overwhelmed by thousands of tweets, retweets, and responses.\n“Thank you for everything you did for the community,” said one follower. “Thank you for helping my wife and me get our first shots!” wrote another. (Indeed, TurboVax followers showed their appreciation by raising more than $200,000 for small businesses in New York’s Chinatown when Ma asked for help amid rising anti-Asian violence.) \nI looked through Dr. B’s feed for similar expressions of thanks from grateful, vaccinated users, and found none. But unlike its peers, the company has no plans to shut down even though the appointment crunch has largely passed. Instead, Massoumi and the company say they are looking to what comes next. He says maybe they’ll collaborate with mobile vaccination clinics, or focus on booster shots. And now that the vaccination chaos has largely passed in the US? He wants to take Dr. B overseas. After all, he told me during our interview, the US effort has come so far. “We’ve touched millions of people,” he said.\nThis story is part of the Pandemic Technology Project, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.","dc:creator":"Mia Sato","content":"When Joanie Schaffer heard about Dr. B, a free covid-19 vaccine standby service, she was running out of options.

Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. Hence, we employ empiricism—based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—in a continuous feedback loop that allows us to defer an investment decision to the last economically feasible moment in time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite all this mitigation effort, any Sprint Goal remains a hypothesis until we release the resulting Increment into the hands of our customers. The release is the moment of truth, and occasional failure is inevitable—even for the best Scrum Teams. Therefore, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>What Happens If There Is no Failure Culture</h2> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. If resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-failure-culture-making-your-scrum-work-10/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Scrum Failure Culture — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture. In a complex environment, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure. In my eyes, failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. By all means, avoid turning failure into your organization’s innovation scarecrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is your organization failing to embrace a Scrum failure culture, thus impeding Scrum?

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. To make things worse, a crucial success factor of every Scrum team is not even mentioned in the Scrum Guide: Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture.\n \r\n\r\n📺 Join me and explore the consequences of not living a failure culture in less than three minutes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one? Awesome! You can sign up here for the ‘Food for Agile Thought’ newsletter and join 31,000-plus other subscribers.\n\r\n\r\n🎓 Join Stefan in one of his upcoming Professional Scrum training classes!\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin more than 240 peers from May 27-29, 2021, for the Virtual Agile Camp Berlin 2021, a live virtual Barcamp using open space technology principles and practices.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Embracing Failure as an Option Is Essential\n\r\n\r\nScrum is about figuring out what is worth building to improve your customers’ lives while mitigating risk in a complex environment. Literally, we do not want to bet the farm on a hunch what customers will purchase in the future. Hence, we employ empiricism—based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—in a continuous feedback loop that allows us to defer an investment decision to the last economically feasible moment in time. \n\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all this mitigation effort, any Sprint Goal remains a hypothesis until we release the resulting Increment into the hands of our customers. The release is the moment of truth, and occasional failure is inevitable—even for the best Scrum Teams. Therefore, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure.\n \r\n\r\nWhat Happens If There Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. If resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nScrum Failure Culture — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nAny organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture. In a complex environment, the question is not if we will fail, but when we will fail. Moreover, how we will deal with the failure. In my eyes, failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. By all means, avoid turning failure into your organization’s innovation scarecrow.\n\r\n\r\nHow is your organization failing to embrace a Scrum failure culture, thus impeding Scrum?

Also, we point at how sociotechnical architecture and systems thinking are key to enabling product thinking in organizations.\n\r\n\r\nWe then share an eight-step strategy workshop; we understand why ‘going deep’ is Stripe’s core product principle, and we wonder why some product managers hold on to timeline-based planning while product roadmaps have evolved so rapidly in recent years. \n \r\n\r\nLastly, we analyze the idea of ‘autonomy’ in the workplace, particularly regarding two challenges: the air sandwich and politics.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you miss the previous Food for Agile Thought’s issue #292?\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

They created LeSS to encourage organizations to answer another question instead: “How can we simplify an unnecessarily big and complex organization to <em>be</em> agile rather than to <em>do</em> agile?”. Precisely because LeSS promotes combatting complexity by reducing it, LeSS can be seen as a <em>descaling</em> framework rather than a scaling framework.</p><p>Like Scrum, LeSS is a lightweight framework for building products in complex environments. It provides a minimal set of rules that defines an organizational design aimed to maximize customer focus and lowering the cost of change (adaptability).</p><h3>Why not just Scrum? Why do you need something else?</h3><p>That’s right. Ideally, you don’t!</p><p>One of the most significant pieces of advice from the creators of Large-Scale Scrum is <strong>not to scale</strong>. The preferred setup of LeSS is <strong>one-team LeSS, which is Scrum</strong>. By now, fortunately, people understand that building products in complex environments is knowledge work, and you can’t fulfill twice as many requirements or cut the development effort in half by adding twice as many developers. However, there are still situations where products can’t be built by just one team. Contrary to popular belief, this is not necessary but often attempted all the same. Building a self-driving car including software and hardware could be a good example where it might be necessary that several hundred people band together. <br>As Willem-Jan mentioned in his article, Scrum provides a solution for that:</p><blockquote>“If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.” — Scrum Guide 2020</blockquote><p>While one might argue that this is enough guidance to do Scrum with multiple teams, it leaves many things open to interpretation (or experimentation). Are we doing one Sprint Review for all Scrum Teams or each Scrum Team individually? How about the Sprint Retrospectives, a pivotal part of enabling empirical process control? Is it better to have a Retrospective with all teams, or could each Scrum Team do their own separately? Here, LeSS provides guidance by offering strict rules: One Sprint Review for all Teams, Team Retrospectives, and an Overall Retrospective with team representatives from the different teams.</p><p>But besides mere process questions, there is an even more critical reason why Scrum alone will most likely not prosper in a large organization. Unless you are dealing with a 7–9 people startup, <em>there is usually an organizational context around cross-functional, self-managing teams, and this context has complexity built-in.</em> There are policies and structures like hiring, salaries, skills development, and team composition. All of these factors impact the culture and the way the team(s) work together.</p><p><em>Not understanding these effects can have a substantial negative impact on maximizing the value created by the product group, in complex environments.</em></p><p>In other words, introducing Scrum without taking environmental effects on the team(s) into account is just as ineffective as having a manager command a team to self-organize while <em>not</em> providing an enabling structure.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oE6iTkmDs4wgo2zoaTTapw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@martinirc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">José Martín Ramírez Carrasco</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/collections/10510639/management-and-organizations?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>But here comes the most problematic part. The Scrum Guide states:</p><blockquote>“Scrum Teams are [self-managing and] cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint”. — Scrum Guide 2020</blockquote><p>A single Scrum Team building a single product is implicitly a feature team, a team that delivers value in the eye of the paying customer each Sprint. In this context, the word “value” doesn’t have to be explicitly defined. For two teams working on the same product, a design choice occurs though: should they specialize in the business domain or in the technical domain?</p><p>The latter case could result in “value” being interpreted as an enhanced technical component. As a matter of fact, many teams in large development groups are specialized in the technology domain to the extent that they only work on specific technical components, becoming so-called component teams. This naturally leads to dependencies between the teams that need to be managed before a new product increment can be released.</p><blockquote>In LeSS, there is no need to manage internal dependencies [, dependencies between the teams within a product group] — Large-Scale Scrum (More with LeSS), C. Larman, B. Vodde, Page 199</blockquote><p>What LeSS does as a descaling framework is to slightly extend the Scrum rules in order to eliminate prominent “first-order” anti-adaptive elements like “component teams” from the example above. In LeSS, teams are not only cross-functional and self-managing, they are also cross-component feature teams which means that they can work on all parts of the product to create customer-centric features. In addition to this, LeSS provides principles, many guides, and hundreds(!) of experiments. The guides and experiments are non-prescriptive suggestions you can try when making decisions about how to build products in a complex environment. The principles, on the other hand, guide you in strengthening the foundations of an agile mindset in your organization.</p><h3>How to reduce complexity with LeSS</h3><p>While I completely agree with Willem-Jan that scaling frameworks add unnecessary complexity to the product development environment and should be avoided whenever possible, LeSS, when correctly understood, helps navigate complex environments, and challenges you to simplify and reduce complexity.</p><p>For example, LeSS recommends only one Product Backlog for the whole product, no matter how many teams work on it. It’s only when this single Product Backlog becomes unclear and unmanageable — this could happen if you are working with more than 30 teams — that there is the recommendation to create customer-centric views on this one Product Backlog (for example, with filters).</p><p>In doing so, you reduce complexity without requiring additional coordination between teams. In other words, the Area Product Backlogs are only filtered views of the one Product Backlog for all teams, not additional artifacts!</p><p>Thus, Area Product Owners are only needed when the product is so huge that to reduce complexity, it’s better to divide it into smaller products that can be viewed almost independently of each other. To be clear here, you will never have Area Product Owners in LeSS (Huge) if you don’t have more than eight teams, and even then LeSS advises against adopting LeSS Huge if the PO and the teams are not overwhelmed by the backlog.</p><p>I hope this article provides a better understanding of “Why LeSS?” and why, in some situations, you might need more than Scrum — but not a scaling framework — to build products in complex environments. In the article that will follow, I will explore in more detail what exactly you need besides Scrum to have an organization optimized for improved adaptability and customer value.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/969/0*blcpNK6knuXpadVV.png\" /></figure><p><a href=\"http://seriousscrum.com/invite\">Do you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ce945e0c2fb3\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum/why-you-cant-compare-less-to-any-scaling-framework-like-safe-ce945e0c2fb3\">Why you can’t compare LeSS to any scaling Framework like SAFe</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum\">Serious Scrum</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"The important difference between a scaling and de-scaling framework\nWillem-Jan Ageling recently posted an excellent article called “The Disastrous Impact Of Framing Scrum As An Incomplete Framework” that explains the negative impact of scaling frameworks on the Agility introduced by Scrum:\n“A scaling framework may seem like a solution to your problems, but they add to the complexity and make Scrum less effective in the end.” — W.J. Ageling\nUnfortunately, he listed LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) as one of the existing scaling frameworks, next to SAFe, Scrum@Scale, Nexus, and Scrum of Scrums.

Here, LeSS provides guidance by offering strict rules: One Sprint Review for all Teams, Team Retrospectives, and an Overall Retrospective with team representatives from the different teams.\nBut besides mere process questions, there is an even more critical reason why Scrum alone will most likely not prosper in a large organization. Unless you are dealing with a 7–9 people startup, there is usually an organizational context around cross-functional, self-managing teams, and this context has complexity built-in. There are policies and structures like hiring, salaries, skills development, and team composition. All of these factors impact the culture and the way the team(s) work together.\nNot understanding these effects can have a substantial negative impact on maximizing the value created by the product group, in complex environments.\nIn other words, introducing Scrum without taking environmental effects on the team(s) into account is just as ineffective as having a manager command a team to self-organize while not providing an enabling structure.\nPhoto by José Martín Ramírez Carrasco on Unsplash\nBut here comes the most problematic part. The Scrum Guide states:\n“Scrum Teams are [self-managing and] cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint”. — Scrum Guide 2020\nA single Scrum Team building a single product is implicitly a feature team, a team that delivers value in the eye of the paying customer each Sprint. In this context, the word “value” doesn’t have to be explicitly defined. For two teams working on the same product, a design choice occurs though: should they specialize in the business domain or in the technical domain?\nThe latter case could result in “value” being interpreted as an enhanced technical component. As a matter of fact, many teams in large development groups are specialized in the technology domain to the extent that they only work on specific technical components, becoming so-called component teams. This naturally leads to dependencies between the teams that need to be managed before a new product increment can be released.\nIn LeSS, there is no need to manage internal dependencies [, dependencies between the teams within a product group] — Large-Scale Scrum (More with LeSS), C. Larman, B. Vodde, Page 199\nWhat LeSS does as a descaling framework is to slightly extend the Scrum rules in order to eliminate prominent “first-order” anti-adaptive elements like “component teams” from the example above. In LeSS, teams are not only cross-functional and self-managing, they are also cross-component feature teams which means that they can work on all parts of the product to create customer-centric features. In addition to this, LeSS provides principles, many guides, and hundreds(!) of experiments. The guides and experiments are non-prescriptive suggestions you can try when making decisions about how to build products in a complex environment. The principles, on the other hand, guide you in strengthening the foundations of an agile mindset in your organization.\nHow to reduce complexity with LeSS\nWhile I completely agree with Willem-Jan that scaling frameworks add unnecessary complexity to the product development environment and should be avoided whenever possible, LeSS, when correctly understood, helps navigate complex environments, and challenges you to simplify and reduce complexity.\nFor example, LeSS recommends only one Product Backlog for the whole product, no matter how many teams work on it. It’s only when this single Product Backlog becomes unclear and unmanageable — this could happen if you are working with more than 30 teams — that there is the recommendation to create customer-centric views on this one Product Backlog (for example, with filters).\nIn doing so, you reduce complexity without requiring additional coordination between teams. In other words, the Area Product Backlogs are only filtered views of the one Product Backlog for all teams, not additional artifacts!\nThus, Area Product Owners are only needed when the product is so huge that to reduce complexity, it’s better to divide it into smaller products that can be viewed almost independently of each other. To be clear here, you will never have Area Product Owners in LeSS (Huge) if you don’t have more than eight teams, and even then LeSS advises against adopting LeSS Huge if the PO and the teams are not overwhelmed by the backlog.\nI hope this article provides a better understanding of “Why LeSS?” and why, in some situations, you might need more than Scrum — but not a scaling framework — to build products in complex environments. In the article that will follow, I will explore in more detail what exactly you need besides Scrum to have an organization optimized for improved adaptability and customer value.\n\nDo you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?\n\nWhy you can’t compare LeSS to any scaling Framework like SAFe was originally published in Serious Scrum on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Robert Briese","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ce945e0c2fb3","categories":["less","scrum","serious-scrum","scaling","framework"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T19:12:51.000Z"},{"creator":"Juned Ghanchi","title":"How Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India?","link":"https://productcoalition.com/how-small-companies-can-benefit-from-mobile-app-development-india-d45d1033fc57?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 10:41:45 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DAoAeFaAFI21iVUc_ETKQw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Never before have we seen such an overwhelming boom of small business apps than what we are observing now.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity.

In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers Code Fallacy — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nIf your Scrum Team strives to be successful, everyone on the team needs to talk to customers regularly—without exception in the best case. In my experience, even die-hard introverts enjoy serving in customer support from time to time. Without this direct customer interaction, we will fail to honor the tenth principle of the Agile Manifesto: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”\n\r\n\r\nWhat other organizational anti-patterns have you observed that impede Scrum?

As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p><p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option.</p><p>And failure needs to be openly discussed — without repercussions — so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Du0B3Svz7aaY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href\">https://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href</a></iframe><h3>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h3><p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p><p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p><p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option.\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed — without repercussions — so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\nhttps://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 10: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 10: These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 12: However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 12: The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\" title=\"The Scrum Guide 2020 — Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Scrum Guide on stakeholders</a>.

The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li>\r\n\t<li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) </p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoGE0hlHbkrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>There Is no Failure Culture</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>A former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fu0B3Svz7aaY%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\n\r\n\t\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\n\r\n\t\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time.

When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\n \r\n\r\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\n\r\n\r\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">generate as much buy-in as possible</a>, as I explain in more detail in my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16393\">Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People</a>.&#8221; But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don&#8217;t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires <em>full-stack ownership</em>: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a> to the product details. The individual should carry out<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\"> product discovery</a> and strategy work in addition to taking care of the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog work</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">Scaling the Product Owner</a>.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png\" alt=\"Full-stack product owner vs. partial product owner\" class=\"wp-image-17099\" width=\"661\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-300x147.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-768x377.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO.png 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Be therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the product owner, you should focus on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10812\">product</a>, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">sacrifice your health</a>—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">care about the development teams</a> you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-owner-sprint-retrospective/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8232\">sprint retrospective</a>. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how <em>you</em> can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery work</a>, spending more time jointly <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/refining-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15179\">refining the product backlog</a>, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">review finished work</a> results during the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">Refining the product backlog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">writing user stories</a> is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is important that you don&#8217;t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a>, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-planning-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14390\">create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint</a> and succeed in meeting the sprint goal. If the items are too big and coarse-grained, most teams will struggle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, strike the right balance between strategic and tactical work and spend enough time working on the product backlog together with the development team members. As the product owner, it&#8217;s your responsibility that the work required to progress the product and reach the (next) <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">product goal</a> is adequately captured in the product backlog. Such a backlog has enough “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>” high-priority items to guide the work of the development team and to allow its members to create a “done” product increment—executable software that is tested and documented and that could be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #5: It’s the product owner’s job to get the project delivered</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional approaches to software development, Scrum does not offer the role of a project manager. It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a <em>product management</em> role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it. To put it differently, you can think of the product owner as a product life-cycle manager, which encourages decisions that result in sustainable growth and consider the product’s longer-term impact on the users and the business. The picture below illustrates this concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png\" alt=\"Product owner and the product life cycle\" class=\"wp-image-17100\" width=\"525\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png 1008w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-300x235.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture above shows how a product might create value over time together with three key events: launching the product, achieving product-market fit, and retiring the product (end of life). Only once it has achieved product-market fit (PMF) and entered the growth stage, has a product started to become successful. A product owner should therefore look after a product at least until PMF, preferably longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with the job of a project manager who is responsible for delivering a project to an agreed scope on time and on budget. Once that’s been achieved, the project manager’s work is done, and the individual often moves on and works on another project, which might progress a different product. A project manager is therefore focused on a comparatively short-term effort instead of a longer-term outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, avoid being a <em>project</em> owner but aspire to manage your product for an extended period, ideally for its entire life cycle. This does not imply, however, that you should not care about meeting a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goal</a> in a realistic timeframe on an agreed budget. The opposite is the case: Use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release planning tools and techniques</a> that work for you to track and guide the development progress. But create a continuity of purpose by working with a product roadmap like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO roadmap</a> that captures the specific outcomes the product is likely to create in the next six to twelve months.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/\">Five Product Owner Myths Busted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Myth #1: The product owner must ensure that the stakeholders are satisfied\nStakeholders can be powerful and influential individuals. But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal stakeholders such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.\nAt the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and generate as much buy-in as possible, as I explain in more detail in my article “Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People.” But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don’t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.\nMyth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog\nIn Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires full-stack ownership: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the product vision to the product details. The individual should carry out product discovery and strategy work in addition to taking care of the product backlog work.\nBut the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “Scaling the Product Owner.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.\n\nBe therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role.

But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. Refining the product backlog and writing user stories is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones.

Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nCreate and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my upcoming training classes here.\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\n\r\n\r\nIt helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nWhat principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches. We appreciate a new ebook on dealing with difficult stakeholders and critical situations, and we learn a simple approach to measuring team productivity: Don’t touch velocity! </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we learn that Gitlab identified a new DevOps maturity model. </p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #291: Hypotheses Validation, Authentic Feedback, Measuring Productivity, The Art of Removing Features — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65945\" data-wp-pid=\"65945\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65937\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-290-design-thinking-scrum/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #290: Design Thinking Scrum, Product vs. Project Teams, Agile Leadership Practice Library, Disrupting Disrupters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #290</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.\n\r\n\r\nWe then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches.

Assume as CEO that it will be impossible to retain 100% of your employees no matter what you decide. There’s going to be a talent reshuffling for the next 6–24 months IMO as employees decide whether their current employer’s workplace strategy is right for them or not.\nAnd resist the urge to reduce this to assumptions like “equitable workplaces are those with the fewest mandates.” These choices are complex, often with unintended consequences. Flexible schedules more friendly for women? Unclear according to this WSJ article:\nDenise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, said hybrid models appear to offer the benefits of both worlds. But they could inadvertently disadvantage women, who shoulder the bulk of caregiving duties and may be more likely to seek more home-based arrangements and miss out on professional face-time, she said. Any solution to one problem will raise other challenges, she said.\n\n\n\n\nThe President of Barnard College fears similar and notes it’s about systems of choices, not just a single decision:\nSo what should well-intentioned companies and managers do? If you think flexible work will boost equity, especially for parents, it is critical to consider what other policies and practices must be in place to advance this goal. Providing paid family and parental leave — as opposed to just maternity leave — and encouraging employees to take it is one example. Ensuring managers do not favor in-person employees for mentorships, in evaluations or for other opportunities is another.\n\n\n\n\nSo start thinking about what’s right for your stage of company, the type of product you build, the culture you’ve created, and then prepare for a lot of communication over the second half of the year.","dc:creator":"hunterwalk","content":"Engage your team and understand their needs but craft your “Return To Office” strategy from the top down We’ve backed a wide variety of startups at Homebrew but the CEOs are now all coalescing around one theme: it’s time to start making choices about what ‘back to the office’ looks like (note 95%+ of our [&#8230;]","contentSnippet":"Engage your team and understand their needs but craft your “Return To Office” strategy from the top down We’ve backed a wide variety of startups at Homebrew but the CEOs are now all coalescing around one theme: it’s time to start making choices about what ‘back to the office’ looks like (note 95%+ of our […]","guid":"https://hunterwalk.com/?p=9317","categories":["Uncategorized"],"isoDate":"2021-05-08T04:05:17.000Z"},{"creator":"Stefan Wolpers","title":"The Blame Game Retrospective — Making Your Scrum Work #6","link":"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/","pubDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 13:07:10 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>TL; DR: The Blame Game Retrospective </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum.

The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\u000b\r\n\t<li>Commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b</li>\r\n\t<li>If Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives — Scrum Values — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65925\" data-wp-pid=\"65925\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/data-informed-retrospectives/\" title=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data-Informed Retrospectives</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0EHmvUIngkQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure.

The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThe Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: \n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nCommitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b\n\r\n\t\nIf Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure. Among those, the blame game, the finger-pointing, is the most obvious and challenging that requires the utmost attention from all team members to overcome.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sprint Retrospective anti-patterns have you observed?

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner\" title=\"The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Oversized Product Backlogs</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>The Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Garbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers &#038; the organization. </li>\r\n\t<li>The Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpet3ZRyTx34%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Product Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You are likely to end up in a feature factory.</li>\r\n\t<li>Probably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" title=\"Conway’s law\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conway’s law</a>: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.”)</li>\r\n\t<li>If you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fgc15kRtrNVg%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>I Know What to Build—Follow Me!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks &#038; balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0Zl-FMOjS9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point.

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:\n\r\n\r\nOversized Product Backlogs\n \r\n\r\nThe Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nGarbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are likely to end up in a feature factory.\n\r\n\t\nProbably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (Conway’s law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”)\n\r\n\t\nIf you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know What to Build—Follow Me!\n\r\n\r\nIn this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. \n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks & balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Product Owner failures have you observed?

For those who know me well, it’s pretty much, “Yeah, duh.” But for those who have only been exposed to me in public settings, or online, there’s usually more surprise that a venture capitalist like me could be an introvert.&nbsp;People sometimes mistake introversion for shyness or lack of confidence.&nbsp;But it’s really about whether being with people&nbsp;<em>gives</em>&nbsp;you energy or&nbsp;<em>takes</em>&nbsp;energy away.&nbsp;I love people, I just need adequate amounts of time to recharge, usually spent by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re human, which means the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/a-year-of-zoom-genitals-bourbon-bottles-child-rearing-632167ea052d\">past 12 months</a>&nbsp;were probably pretty tumultuous for you. My family has been incredibly fortunate and hopefully, the long-term consequences are going to be minimal. Lately, I’ve found myself mostly trying to figure out what lessons my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/what-lessons-will-our-children-learn-from-covid19-and-will-they-be-useful-ones-e2635eb3dfe7\">daughter should learn from this time</a>, and what lessons we specifically&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;want her to carry throughout her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to my job, after practicing venture capital for seven years under normal circumstances, it was instructive to get thrown into this new scenario, because I don’t think we’ll ever fully “return to normal.” Instead, we’ll blend aspects of pre-2020 and our experiences from the past year into a “new normal.” This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people. It’s a work-in-process but here’s what I’m thinking:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Group events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, these would always trip me up. I would experience some social anxiety mixed with generally feeling overwhelmed by my own internal scorecarding and thoughts of, “Am I networking enough?” Now on Zoom, I can just fall back to audio-only, or drop off the gathering when I’m ready to leave. (What’s the “turn off video” equivalent for me when being at a large event? Probably peeling away with a person or two for the ol’ walk and talk.) Going forward, I think virtual events will continue to evolve beyond the Zoom room and into formats like Icebreaker. I can’t say that Covid-19 has made me rethink the personal utility of the really big conferences (I don’t attend many), but it does make me miss the curation of smaller groups.&nbsp;The events where hosts put effort into bringing together people with a high degree of purpose and work hard to ensure mixing, those are wonderful. My 2022 will hopefully include a return to events like these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working with founders</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what I really have missed.&nbsp;You might think I’m referring to the time spent with a founder before deciding to make an investment in their startup, and certainly, there are moments where an in-person conversation can be the difference between Deal or No Deal. But I don’t think we’ll ever go back to 100% in-person pitching, especially in the earliest stages of getting to know someone.&nbsp;It’s just too mutually efficient to make a first pitch into a call or video, especially if the founders prefer it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>What I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.&nbsp;Not the perfunctory showing up in person for a board meeting (although sometimes being there is important), but rather the stuff which requires as much EQ (or emotional intelligence) as IQ. And I’m anticipating doing a lot of this in the places our portfolio companies are scattered: the Bay Area, New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Toronto, Portland, San Diego, Boston, Salt Lake City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I sense lots of startup teams are ready to get back into offices as well or at least have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/the-essential-nature-of-in-person-work-for-early-stage-startups-3a19e24342fc\">flexibility to work in-person</a>&nbsp;for the periods where collaboration and culture-building are most essential. If I were early in my career, it would absolutely be my preference to work for a company with an in-office culture (either full-time or hybrid). There’s just so much community and&nbsp;learning-by-osmosis (or serendipity) that comes from being together.&nbsp;So while our VC firm&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homebrew.co/\">Homebrew</a>&nbsp;definitely invests in companies that are 100% remote/distributed, we also espouse being intentional about what it means to do so and not underinvest in the infrastructure, travel, and skill-building it takes to succeed in this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work-life balance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we still call it this?&nbsp;How about just happiness and sanity?&nbsp;I’ve found that I really enjoy driving my kid to school on Friday mornings. I’ve found that playing backgammon with my wife over lunch is nice when our mutual schedules accommodate. I’ve grown increasingly fond of just talking on the phone with a founder for five minutes when they need some help (versus going back and forth over email).&nbsp;Optimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain.&nbsp;My weekdays are basically 80% Homebrew, 20% family, with my weekends being the reverse.

For those who know me well, it’s pretty much, “Yeah, duh.” But for those who have only been exposed to me in public settings, or online, there’s usually more surprise that a venture capitalist like me could be an introvert. People sometimes mistake introversion for shyness or lack of confidence. But it’s really about whether being with people gives you energy or takes energy away. I love people, I just need adequate amounts of time to recharge, usually spent by myself.\nIf you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re human, which means the past 12 months were probably pretty tumultuous for you. My family has been incredibly fortunate and hopefully, the long-term consequences are going to be minimal. Lately, I’ve found myself mostly trying to figure out what lessons my daughter should learn from this time, and what lessons we specifically don’t want her to carry throughout her life.\nThis has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people.\nWhen it comes to my job, after practicing venture capital for seven years under normal circumstances, it was instructive to get thrown into this new scenario, because I don’t think we’ll ever fully “return to normal.” Instead, we’ll blend aspects of pre-2020 and our experiences from the past year into a “new normal.” This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people. It’s a work-in-process but here’s what I’m thinking:\nGroup events\nIn the past, these would always trip me up. I would experience some social anxiety mixed with generally feeling overwhelmed by my own internal scorecarding and thoughts of, “Am I networking enough?” Now on Zoom, I can just fall back to audio-only, or drop off the gathering when I’m ready to leave. (What’s the “turn off video” equivalent for me when being at a large event? Probably peeling away with a person or two for the ol’ walk and talk.) Going forward, I think virtual events will continue to evolve beyond the Zoom room and into formats like Icebreaker. I can’t say that Covid-19 has made me rethink the personal utility of the really big conferences (I don’t attend many), but it does make me miss the curation of smaller groups. The events where hosts put effort into bringing together people with a high degree of purpose and work hard to ensure mixing, those are wonderful. My 2022 will hopefully include a return to events like these.\nWorking with founders\nThis is what I really have missed. You might think I’m referring to the time spent with a founder before deciding to make an investment in their startup, and certainly, there are moments where an in-person conversation can be the difference between Deal or No Deal. But I don’t think we’ll ever go back to 100% in-person pitching, especially in the earliest stages of getting to know someone. It’s just too mutually efficient to make a first pitch into a call or video, especially if the founders prefer it.\n\nWhat I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.\n\n\n\n\nBut what I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard. Not the perfunctory showing up in person for a board meeting (although sometimes being there is important), but rather the stuff which requires as much EQ (or emotional intelligence) as IQ. And I’m anticipating doing a lot of this in the places our portfolio companies are scattered: the Bay Area, New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Toronto, Portland, San Diego, Boston, Salt Lake City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and so on.\nFor what it’s worth, I sense lots of startup teams are ready to get back into offices as well or at least have the flexibility to work in-person for the periods where collaboration and culture-building are most essential. If I were early in my career, it would absolutely be my preference to work for a company with an in-office culture (either full-time or hybrid). There’s just so much community and learning-by-osmosis (or serendipity) that comes from being together. So while our VC firm Homebrew definitely invests in companies that are 100% remote/distributed, we also espouse being intentional about what it means to do so and not underinvest in the infrastructure, travel, and skill-building it takes to succeed in this model.\nWork-life balance\nDo we still call it this? How about just happiness and sanity? I’ve found that I really enjoy driving my kid to school on Friday mornings. I’ve found that playing backgammon with my wife over lunch is nice when our mutual schedules accommodate. I’ve grown increasingly fond of just talking on the phone with a founder for five minutes when they need some help (versus going back and forth over email). Optimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain. My weekdays are basically 80% Homebrew, 20% family, with my weekends being the reverse. So far it’s worked out pretty well, except I think my dog is going to be shocked when we’re not in the house with her 24/7.\n\nOptimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain.\n\n\n\n\nHomebrew closed its office in San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood last March, and we’ve only been in there a handful of times since.

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want to offer a product that <em>reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes </em>and that <em>generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app</em>. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">strategy validation techniques</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> I have captured on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">Product Goals in Scrum</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to <em>allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base</em>. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen <em>user feedback</em>, <em>net promoter score</em>, and <em>referral rate</em>, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, <em>acquire an initial user base</em>, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Health Indicators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/technical-debt-and-product-success/\">technical debt</a>, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less is More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better.

Misinformation, trolling, harassment, polarization, and the resulting negative implications — none of these are as simple to define as CTR or CPM. I myself fell victim to this during my time leading the consumer product team at YouTube. When Google leadership asked us to shift from focusing solely on user growth to also increasing monetization, the team we destaffed to fund the new effort had been working on the comments system. Yup, YouTube comments, which most often resulted in a lot of name-calling, profanity, and worse. We all wanted it to improve, but why did I sacrifice this project in the near term?

It’s not crazy to wonder this, and while I don’t believe that it’s a true correlation or that our social platforms are intentionally running at the efficient frontier of anger and profits, I do always wonder what <a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/is-the-quest-for-software-margins-to-blame-for-twitters-trolls-facebook-s-russians-and-1ef0bef605bc\">margin pressure</a> does to, say, adequate investment in trust and safety.<br><br>Casey Newton’s <em>Platformer</em> article about <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/facebooks-ai-reckoning?r=2c7b&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy\">Facebook’s Responsible A.I. team</a> provoked a combination of eagerness and skepticism. My fear is that even if these teams are actually equipped to study and challenge internally held beliefs about their products, they will be forbidden from making changes that negatively impact business metrics. That is to say, we want responsibility but only when it doesn’t put the stock price at risk. I say this not just (or specifically) about Facebook, but more generally about the complexity of incentives within a corporation.

While much of Silicon Valley was already curtailing travel and starting to work from home, zeitgeist watchers note a perfect storm of the NBA suspending their season, Tom Hanks being diagnosed as positive, WHO declaring a global pandemic and He Which Shall Not Be Named implementing a travel ban (actually a good idea) as the starting point for “this isn’t just the flu.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading&nbsp;Maya Kosoff’s ‘<a href=\"https://kosoff.medium.com/i-always-knew-2020-was-going-to-be-a-lost-year-8889807949bf\">Lost Year</a>’ essay as part of Medium’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/tag/pandemic-reflections\">Pandemic Reflections</a>&nbsp;made me consider my own past 12 months. Because of my love for this thing we call the World Wide Web, I’m going to do my own reminiscing via Five Links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID Tracking Project</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An oasis in a misinformation desert, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/\">COVID Tracking Project&nbsp;</a>started very ad hoc but was always authoritative and reliable in trying to understand the illness’ spread. Good data helped put so much in perspective: that this thing was running wild, that it was disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and geographies and that outside of vaccines, the spread *could* be managed via safety practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the numbers got larger and we almost numbed to the milestones, I stopped focusing on the quantitative and transitioned to the qualitative, namely how to emotionally support my family and my community. The COVID Tracking Project will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/covid-tracking-project-end-march-7\">discontinue updating</a>&nbsp;on its first anniversary (March 7, 2021) but it was one of the URLs that defined my first year of COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Casey Newton &amp; I Got&nbsp;Zoombombed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on this whole WFH thing was kinda silly and fun in the tech industry.

I got to say things like “I’ve never ordered so much Goldbelly!” while others lost paychecks and family members. My friend Nikhil summarized so many of my thoughts in his essay&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nbt.substack.com/p/a-widening-gap\">A Widening Gap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A widening gap. A gap between the “haves” and the “have nots,” between those with disposable income and those that don’t have jobs.&nbsp;A gap between fact and fiction, between those that have access to the truth and those that are fed lies non-stop. A gap that’s been exacerbated by the pandemic, certainly, but also by the forces of technology, media, and politics, not just in the last four years, but for the past decade.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It will take considerable work, across technology, media, and government, to reverse this course. There isn’t a simple solution that will be the&nbsp;</em>next big thing<em>&nbsp;in 2021; instead, it’s going to take years of effort.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I appreciate about Nikhil’s blog post was that it’s not just about tech’ing our way out of this dynamic, but about empathy, caring and even some sacrifice. “Do Things That Don’t Scale” is classic startup advice and I feel the same way about the beginnings of what it takes to reverse these inequality dynamics. Beyond structural change, if we each just cared for a handful of other people in a way that extended beyond our immediate circles, we’d make so much progress. It’s why I love direct action nonprofits such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://detroitwaterproject.org/\">Human Utility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Virtual Drinking Buddies</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years when people asked what my hobbies were I’d kind of shrug my shoulders. There were activities I enjoyed (movies! friends! work!) but nothing that I’d consider a ‘hobby.’&nbsp;Maybe I’d been overly influenced by the people around me who, when they pursued something, did so with a focus that turned “jogging” into “complete marathons on all continents” and “cooking” into “I’m spending the summer in France as an apprentice pastry baker.”&nbsp;If a hobby equated to something you spent too much time and money on, then my only hobby was therapy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’d gotten tired of not having an answer and started telling folks my hobbies were&nbsp;coffee and notebooks (the paper note-taking kind).&nbsp;These were honest answers as I do enjoy researching, purchasing and consuming both of these, but there’s only so far you can go with notebooks and on the coffee front, I cared more about good beans than necessarily experimenting with every prep method, which meant the subreddits were a bit too much for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-forward to the beginning of 2020 and the whiplash we all experienced with travel stopping, restaurants closing and our homes becoming work, play, live 24/7. We’ve all adopted new coping mechanisms and found new aspects to our relationships. Some even used the time to reconsider where they work or move to new cities. Me?&nbsp;I got into whiskey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before sharing more I want to acknowledge that alcohol as a “hobby” can be jarring for many. People close to me have dealt with various addictions, including alcohol, and many more have removed it from their lifestyle in the interest of health, mental clarity and other benefits. Fortunately I’m not prone to over-consumption and my interest has been as much about the history, business and people around the spirit as actual consumption (I’m basically a 1–4 oz type of guy — for reference, the average 750ml bottle is roughly 25 ounces).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d previously been whiskey-curious, buying a bottle every now and then, trying different bourbons in a bar and so on. But about a year ago I joined a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SFWhiskies/\">local Bay Area whiskey group</a>&nbsp;that I’ve enjoyed learning from, sharing with and doing virtual tastings.

While much of Silicon Valley was already curtailing travel and starting to work from home, zeitgeist watchers note a perfect storm of the NBA suspending their season, Tom Hanks being diagnosed as positive, WHO declaring a global pandemic and He Which Shall Not Be Named implementing a travel ban (actually a good idea) as the starting point for “this isn’t just the flu.”\nReading Maya Kosoff’s ‘Lost Year’ essay as part of Medium’s Pandemic Reflections made me consider my own past 12 months. Because of my love for this thing we call the World Wide Web, I’m going to do my own reminiscing via Five Links.\nThe COVID Tracking Project\nAn oasis in a misinformation desert, the COVID Tracking Project started very ad hoc but was always authoritative and reliable in trying to understand the illness’ spread. Good data helped put so much in perspective: that this thing was running wild, that it was disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and geographies and that outside of vaccines, the spread *could* be managed via safety practices.\nAs the numbers got larger and we almost numbed to the milestones, I stopped focusing on the quantitative and transitioned to the qualitative, namely how to emotionally support my family and my community. The COVID Tracking Project will discontinue updating on its first anniversary (March 7, 2021) but it was one of the URLs that defined my first year of COVID.\nWhen Casey Newton & I Got Zoombombed\nEarly on this whole WFH thing was kinda silly and fun in the tech industry.

Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied.

Some view it as the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a>, others equate it to the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">value proposition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a <em>specific and measurable benefit or outcome</em> a product should create in the course of the next <em>two to six months</em>. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are <em>connected to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a></em> and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16846\" width=\"482\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png 993w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-300x252.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-768x644.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The Product Goal in Context</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal.

When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal. It took me years to come up with the set of goals in figure 1. In hindsight, the set looks disappointingly simple <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the contents of this article on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my YouTube Channel</a>:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Product Goals In Scrum\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0NWukbHkDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sample Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand how the goals in figure 1 can be applied, let’s take a look at an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16847\" width=\"491\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-300x237.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-768x606.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Sample Goals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 2, I first captured the vision “Help people eat healthily” and then used it to choose the user and business goals “Reduce the risk of developing type-two diabetes; create new revenue source.” In order to determine the right product goal, I asked myself, “What would be a first good step to meet the from the user and business goal?” I consequently chose the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” I then used this goal to determine the right sprint goal. I figured that finding out if users are willing to share personal information when activating the app would be the most important risk to address and hence should be the goal of the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I chose to use a <em>compound product goal</em> in figure 2 that has a user part—help the users understand their eating habits and business—and a business one—acquire an initial user base. Both parts are closely connected: In order to acquire a user base, the product must offer tangible value to the users, and a first step to help people eat more healthily is to help them become aware of their current eating habits. You don’t have to work with compound product goals of course, if you prefer to focus your objectives on either the user or the business benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Roadmap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting a single product goal is great. But unless you can’t see further than the next few months, I recommend determining the next three to four product goals and capturing them on your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, as figure 3 below shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16848\" width=\"569\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-300x197.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-768x505.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals.png 1197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Sample GO Product Roadmap with Product Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 3 shows a sample roadmap based on my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/the-go-product-roadmap/\">GO product roadmap template</a>, which contains three product goals. Each goal builds on the previous one thereby nicely progressing the product: The first goal helps the users become aware of their eating habits and creates and initial user base. The second one helps people improve their eating habits and acquires additional users. The third product goal, finally, helps the users improve their overall fitness and generates revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Scrum Guide does not mention identifying future product goals and adding them to the product roadmap, I find this practice very helpful: Stakeholders and dev teams usually benefit from understanding how to product is likely to evolve beyond the next two to three months. This helps the individuals create an effective sales and marketing strategy, for example, and to make the right architecture and technology decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Backlog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a product roadmap in place, I like to select the product goal to be worked on and copy it from the roadmap to the product backlog together with any coarse-grained features that are associated with the goal. This approach is illustrated by figure 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16849\" width=\"570\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-300x81.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-768x207.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog.png 1187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Product Goal and Product Backlog</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of using a product goal in the backlog is that it focuses the latter, as I describe in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">The Product Roadmap and the Product Backlog</a>.” This addresses a common issue: Many product backlogs I have seen over the years were too big and too detailed. This made them hard to prioritise and difficult to update, which is bad news as long as your product is young or experiences more than small, incremental changes. In most cases, the product backlogs grew so big because they lacked a measure to decide which items should be added to the backlog and which should not. The product goal is this measure: <em>Only add an item to the product backlog if it helps meet the product goal</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s briefly explore how a product goal might be used on the product backlog. Say I was to start the development of my healthy eating product, I would copy the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base” into the product backlog together with the features “healthy eating dashboard” and “integration with smart watches and fitness devices.” I’d ask myself which additional features are required to meet the product goal and add these to the backlog. I would the start breaking some of the features into <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"538\">prioritise the product backlog</a>. Finally, I’d refine the high-priority items to be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> to start the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can tell, I like product goals and find them very helpful, and I would encourage you to try them out if you haven’t used them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">Product Goals in Scrum</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Product Goals Defined\nThe Scrum Guide released in November 2020 states that “the product goal describes a future state of the product … [It] is the long-term objective for the Scrum team.” It also suggests that “the product goal is in the product backlog.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”</h3><p>(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up <a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/\">here</a>.)</p><p>Given rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.</p><p>To answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Seek high-growth companies.</strong> These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.</li><li><strong>Build your network of peers and mentors.</strong> These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.</li><li><strong>Be ready to learn and unlearn.</strong> One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.</li><li><strong>Working with humans is hard! </strong>Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.</li></ol><p>Below, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.</p><h3>1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)</h3><p>Trip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.</p><p>Early at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:</p><ol><li><strong>How to ship a product on time.</strong> Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.</li><li><strong>How to deal with imposter syndrome.</strong> Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”</li></ol><p>Electronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.</p><p>In my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:</p><ol><li>Here’s what you did well</li><li>Here’s what you could have done better.</li></ol><p>My mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.</p><h3>1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)</h3><p>Greg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:</p><ol><li><strong>Greg forced me out of the building to connect with peers.</strong> He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.</li><li><strong>Greg helped me to transition into a formal leader.</strong> I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.</li></ol><p>Louis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:</p><ol><li><strong>How to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively.</strong> You can read my “<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/branding-for-builders-19e103ef3f1d\">Branding for Builders</a>” essay to learn more.</li><li><strong>How to form successful work relationships.</strong> Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:</li></ol><ul><li>Form (get to know each other to build trust)</li><li>Storm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)</li><li>Norm (develop shared ideas and approaches)</li><li>Perform (based on shared ideas and process)</li></ul><p>I learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.</p><p>Last, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.</p><p>Upon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.</p><h3>The Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)</h3><p>The Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)</p><p>My leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”</p><p>He answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”</p><p>I laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”</p><p>The reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.</p><p>My biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.</p><h3>1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company</h3><p>After two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:</p><blockquote><em>“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we </em>finally<em> talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”</em></blockquote><p>Jonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.</p><p>That week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.</p><h3>2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup</h3><p>Keith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.</p><h3>2005: Netflix</h3><p>When I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:</p><ol><li>“Can you delight customers?”</li><li>“Can you do consumer science?”</li></ol><p>I answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:</p><ol><li><strong>Delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways.</strong> I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/intro-to-product-strategy-60bdf72b17e3\">Here’s</a> my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)</li><li><strong>The power of simplicity.</strong> One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.</li><li><strong>The balancing act of qualitative and quantitative.</strong> In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.</li><li><strong>The downside of management.</strong> Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.</li><li><strong>I learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business</strong>. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”\n(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up here.)\nGiven rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.\nTo answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:\n\nSeek high-growth companies. These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.\nBuild your network of peers and mentors. These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.\nBe ready to learn and unlearn. One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.\nWorking with humans is hard! Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.\n\nBelow, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.\n1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)\nTrip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.\nEarly at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:\n\nHow to ship a product on time. Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.\nHow to deal with imposter syndrome. Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”\n\nElectronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.\nIn my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:\n\nHere’s what you did well\nHere’s what you could have done better.\n\nMy mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.\n1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)\nGreg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:\n\nGreg forced me out of the building to connect with peers. He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.\nGreg helped me to transition into a formal leader. I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.\n\nLouis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:\n\nHow to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively. You can read my “Branding for Builders” essay to learn more.\nHow to form successful work relationships. Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:\n\nForm (get to know each other to build trust)\nStorm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)\nNorm (develop shared ideas and approaches)\nPerform (based on shared ideas and process)\n\nI learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.\nLast, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.\nUpon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.\nThe Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)\nThe Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)\nMy leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”\nHe answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”\nI laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”\nThe reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.\nMy biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.\n1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company\nAfter two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:\n“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we finally talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”\nJonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.\nThat week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.\n2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup\nKeith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.\n2005: Netflix\nWhen I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:\n\n“Can you delight customers?”\n“Can you do consumer science?”\n\nI answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:\n\nDelight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (Here’s my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)\nThe power of simplicity. One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.\nThe balancing act of qualitative and quantitative. In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.\nThe downside of management. Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.\nI learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes. The Netflix culture — its articulation of the values, skills, and behaviors desired for all employees — enabled individuals to make significant decisions without even talking to one another.\n\nLeslie Kilgore ran Marketing at Netflix. While Reed was “all in” on AB testing, Leslie helped me form the customer’s voice in my head through qualitative. Her coaching:\n\nGet outside Silicon Valley. We moved beyond “Silicon Valley Freaks” to find “normal” customers in Providence, Memphis, and Denver, among other cities.\nGet to the “why” through qualitative. Leslie often had a live video feed of focus groups playing in her cube. In a building full of “quant jocks,” it was helpful to get insight into the “why” of customer behavior by listening to our members in focus groups and usability. Leslie was an effective counter-voice to Reed.\nTest big changes. We did lots of testing of our non-member site — our site’s front door. One day Leslie looked down at a print-out of six versions going into the next AB test. In looking at the postage-stamp-sized designs, she struggled to see the differences. She remarked, “If we can’t see the deltas in each version, our customers will never notice them. Our members are way too busy to detect nuance.”\nThe dance between marketing and product. Sometimes we’d test a hypothesis for a new feature on the non-member homepage to see if it improved conversion, and if it did, we’d build the feature. In other cases, the product evolved, and we’d bring attention to a new feature on the non-member homepage later. This “Tango” between product development and marketing continued forever.\n\nThe last person at Netflix who fundamentally influenced my thinking is Patty McCord, the Chief People Officer. She helped me to solve many “people problems” in a highly leveraged way. Her advice:\nWhen presented with a problem from an employee, ask the following question: “When you talked to this person about the issue, what did he or she say.”\nIn 80% of the cases, the person would go back, talk to the other person, and solve the problem independently.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDjkQxXw-2U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Brave New Agile World</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">collaborate much more closely</a>. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/think-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"553\">product-led approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early user feedback, frequent solution validation</strong>: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/beyond-product-demo-validation-techniques-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7876\">validate our ideas</a> and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced time-to-market</strong>: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a> that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better product quality and improved adaptability</strong>: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better requirements</strong>: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\">dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work</a> and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparent development progress</strong>: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">The progress is now based on working software</a> rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved alignment</strong>: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">sprint reviews</a>. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">involving them in the process of making product decisions</a> increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivated productive teams</strong>: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Old and New Product Management Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist.

Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confusion about roles and responsibilities</strong>: Even 20 years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> was conceived, agile roles like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">product owner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.\nDuring the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.\nThis sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.\nYou can also access the content of this article on my YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brave New Agile World\nAs agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to collaborate much more closely. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a product-led approach.\nEarly user feedback, frequent solution validation: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us validate our ideas and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.\nReduced time-to-market: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as user stories that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.\nBetter product quality and improved adaptability: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.\nBetter requirements: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.\nTransparent development progress: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: The progress is now based on working software rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.\nImproved alignment: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like sprint reviews. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and involving them in the process of making product decisions increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.\nMotivated productive teams: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.\nOld and New Product Management Challenges\nWhile agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.\nLack of empowerment: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term product owner instead of product manager in order to emphasise the level of authority and empowerment a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.\nUnfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.\nConfusion about roles and responsibilities: Even 20 years after the Manifesto for Agile Software Development was conceived, agile roles like product owner and Scrum Master are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the Scrum Guide puts it.\nLack of direct interaction with users and customers: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the agile manifesto. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to empathise with the users and customers and to fully understand their needs. This, in turn, reduces the chances of offering a product that does a great job for its target audience and generates the desired business benefits.\nProduct discovery and product strategy poorly practiced: The most beautiful user stories are useless if it’s not clear who the users are and why they would want to use the product. Acquiring this information requires focused product discovery and strategy work. Unfortunately, product discovery and strategy aren’t always effectively practiced. This is not helped by the fact that agile approaches like Scrum do not offer any tools and techniques to help product owners understand if a product should be developed. Fortunately, a number of tools and techniques have emerged in recent years that help product people with their product discovery and strategy work including my product vision board and GO product roadmap.\nLack of sustainable pace: “The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely,” states the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Ironically, working at a healthy, sustainable pace can be particularly challenging in an agile context: Product people have to regularly interact with development teams in order to update the product backlog, agree on sprint goals, answer questions, and provide feedback on product increments in addition to all the other product management duties. Being overworked, however, has a negative impact on our productivity and mental health. Luckily, there are a number of practical measures you can take to achieve sustainable pace. These include not covering other people jobs on a continued basis—like acting as a stand-in Scrum Master—and having the courage to decline stakeholder requests. Please see my article “Sustainable Pace in Product Management” for more guidance.\nLooking into the Crystal Ball\nSo where do we go from here? How will product management change over the next 20 years, and which role will agile methods play—if any?\nWithout having a crystal ball at my disposal, I believe that the future of product management will be shaped by our ability to address the product management challenges mentioned above. I sincerely hope that in 20 years from now, empowerment will no longer be a significant issue, product roles will be better understood and more effectively applied, and product discovery and strategy will always be practiced by anybody who manages or owns a product.

The dev team is struggling with the current workload, and moving the date is not an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, you suspect that John’s request may be motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets. But John is a well-connected and influential individual who doesn’t like to be told that he is wrong. How can you decline his request without offending him and losing his support?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DB0ggAe7ApA?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Feel Bad about Saying<strong> </strong>No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Declining a request can be hard. You might not want to disappoint John in the example above, you might worry that saying no will anger him and lead to conflict, or you might not want to be seen as a naysayer but somebody who has a can-do attitude and wants to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying no, however, is part and parcel of a product person’s job. If you said yes to every idea and request, you would end up with a <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adrenaline-Junkies-Template-Zombies-Understanding/dp/0932633676/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">feature soup</a></em>, a product with an uncompelling value proposition and a poor user experience. As Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe, however, that it would be impossible for you to say no to John, then this may indicate that you are not properly empowered, that you lack the authority and respect required to be in charge of the product and be responsible for its success. If that’s the case, explore how you can strengthen your product leadership. Refer to my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a>&#8221; for more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empathise with the Stakeholder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having decided that you can’t accept John’s request, you might be tempted to share your view with the individual and say, for instance: “Sorry, John. But there is no way that I can add the feature to the current release. The development team is struggling to implement the agreed features, and, as you know, we can’t push out the date.” This might seem like a reasonable answer: It’s direct and it offers an explanation. But would it be effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If John does not feel heard and understood, it will be hard for him to accept no as an answer, no matter how valid your arguments are. Instead, he might feel rejected and react with disappointment or anger. He might think that you don’t appreciate his views and don’t care about his needs. Consequently, John may no longer fully trust and support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this situation and maximise the chances that John can receive a no, empathise with the individual before you offer an answer. Find out why the feature is important to John. What is his personal, vested interest in getting the feature included in the release? Why does it matter to him? Only if John feels understood will he open up to your perspective, listen to your arguments, and accept that you can’t add the feature to the release. The following <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\">listening techniques</a> will help you with this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give your full attention to the individual. Maintain eye contact and show the person that you are interested in what she or he has to say.</li><li>Keep an <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/growth-mindset-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14188\">open mind</a> even if you disagree with what you are hearing or if you dislike the individual. Listen with the intention to understand, not to answer. John might be right, after all, and you should add the feature to the release.</li><li>Pay attention to the person’s body language. Non-verbal information—like voice pitch and volume, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movement—expresses the speaker’s feelings, which help you uncover the individual’s underlying interests.</li><li>Ask clarifying and probing questions to check that you have correctly understood what was said and encourage the other person to provide more information. You might say, for instance, “Can you please help me understand why adding the feature is important to you?”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reframe the Conversati<strong>on</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">Stakeholders</a> often request specific features without necessarily being fully aware of the problem it addresses. But value is hardly created by adding a single piece of functionality—at least as long as a product is young or changing. Instead of debating an individual feature with John, reframe the conversation. Explore which user or customer problem the functionality would help address. How would implementing the feature benefit these individuals? Why do some customers view it as crucial, to stay with the example above? And would there be an alternative way to achieve the desired impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if the feature is aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goal</a> of the current development effort, the outcome you want to achieve, for example, to enter a new market or to increase engagement. Will addressing the user problem help you meet this goal and create the desired benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then you should consider adapting the development effort. You may decide to add the feature to the release, assuming that you make appropriate adjustments like reducing or removing other features or moving the delivery date. But if the answer is no, then you should decline the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Rush the Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be tempting to quickly make a decision just to be done with it. While you don’t want to procrastinate the decision, rushing it is usually a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that the conversation with John has turned difficult. He is adamant that the feature must be added, and he doesn’t want to accept your view. What’s more, he suggests that you don’t understand what the customers want, and he threatens to escalate the issue if you decline his request. In such a situation, it’s natural to feel difficult emotions like confusion, worry, and anger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, it’s best to pause the conversation and to postpone the decision to regain a cool head and allow the difficult feelings to subside. You might say to John, “It’s really important to me that we find a good solution. But I am feeling upset right now, and I need some time to reflect on what I heard you say. Let’s please continue the conversation in the afternoon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if you can and should make the decision on your own. If the decision has a bigger impact, if you require other people’s input to make the right decision, or if you want to secure their buy-in, I recommend scheduling a meeting with all the key stakeholders and the development team representatives in order to discuss and evaluate the feature request and make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">joint decision</a>. You might even find that you need to run an experiment and collect relevant data, for instance, by interviewing users or releasing a feature fake, before you can make the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try to Find Common Ground, but Don’t Split the Difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While saying no is sometimes unavoidable, I recommend that you explore if there is an alternative way to meet the stakeholder’s underlying need. Say that your suspicion turned out to be right: John’s request is, at least partly, motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets and claim a bonus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, find out if you can help him achieve his goal without having to add the feature—assuming that you believe that it is right for you to help John pursue this goal. Would it be helpful, for example, to develop a sales pitch that shows that the product addresses some of the customer needs without providing the extra feature? Or is there another solution you can develop together with John?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t make the mistake, though, to simply split the difference and suggest to John that you will partially implement the feature as part of the current release—unless this would actually meet John’s underlying need and not sacrifice sustainable pace for the development team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do what is necessary to maximise the value your product creates but don’t attempt to please individual stakeholders. Be kind and firm. Remember: Successful products are not built on weak compromises or the smallest common denominator.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-saying-no-to-stakeholders/\">5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Imagine that you are talking to John, a senior salesperson who’s been involved with the product for a while.

cancel rate from 10% to 2%. They did this by balancing delight against margin (profit) while building a durable, hard-to-copy advantage. I call it the <strong>DHM</strong> model: <strong>D</strong>elight customers in <strong>H</strong>ard-to-copy, <strong>M</strong>argin-enhancing ways.</p><p>Today, Netflix’s hard-to-copy attributes are:</p><ul><li>unique technology (personalization, streaming encoding)</li><li>network effects (a large device ecosystem)</li><li>economies of scale (a $20B annual content spend), and a</li><li>trusted brand</li></ul><p>A challenge along the way: How do you evaluate trade-offs between delight and margin? When might you choose to lose money to delight customers?</p><p>Below, I answer both of these questions using two Netflix cases, using directional data.</p><p><strong>2005: The Perfect New Release Experiment</strong></p><p>In 2005, Netflix had one million members in its nascent DVD-by-mail service. The most frequent customer request? Faster new release DVD delivery. The challenge: three months after a movie appeared in theaters, Studios released the DVD version — and as soon as that DVD version dropped, lots of customers wanted it immediately. Within a few months, however, demand decreased as the novelty wore off.</p><p>Rather than buying up a surplus of newly released DVDs to handle that short-term spike in demand, we decided to optimize for the long-term. As a result, during the first few months after a DVD launch, some customers had to wait a week or two to get the new release. If the new release wasn’t available when the customer requested it, we shipped the next movie on the customer’s movie list, then sent the new release when it became available.</p><p>In response to customer requests for faster DVD delivery, we designed a “perfect new release” A/B test and allocated 10,000 customers to the test cell. These customers received their new release DVDs the next day, while customers in the control cell waited for weeks or months to get their new releases. Our delight metric? Retention.</p><p>The questions we hoped to answer:</p><ul><li>Will faster new release DVD delivery improve retention, and, if so, by how much? (At the time, roughly 4.5% of our customers canceled each month).</li><li>If this experience improves retention, is it worth spending more money on DVD inventory? How much more?</li></ul><p>The answer: Yes, faster new release delivery improved retention, but by much less than we expected. The monthly cancel rate improved by about 0.05% — from 4.50% to 4.45%. So, was it worth spending more money on the new release DVD inventory?</p><p>Here’s how we evaluated the balance between delight and margin:</p><ul><li>If we rolled out this “perfect new release” experience to all members, we’d save 5,000 customers/year. (One million subscribers x .05 retention improvement = 5,000 saved customers).</li><li>We believed happier customers would rave about the service, attracting new members via word of mouth, so we doubled the number of saved customers. We estimated that each “saved” customer would attract one new member to the service.</li><li>The value of this perfect new release experience was $1 million: 5,000 saved customers x $100 (the lifetime value of a customer) X 2 for the WOM factor.</li></ul><p>But the cost to deliver that perfect new release experience was $5 million in additional DVD inventory. Given the potential gain of $1 million against a $5M spend, we chose not to roll the feature out to all members.</p><p>What we learned:</p><ol><li>What customers say doesn’t always match their behavior. You need A/B testing to measure behavior change.</li><li>It’s helpful to understand how much customers value different features. We invested in things our members valued (broader DVD selection, lower prices, next-day DVD delivery). We invested less in features they didn’t value (new release DVDs, social, unique movie-finding tools).</li></ol><p>We never established a more precise word-of-mouth factor, though I’ve heard that Amazon sometimes uses an 8X factor. A large WOM multiple encourages more investment in customer delight, but at the time, we couldn’t afford to spend $5 million for a marginal retention improvement.</p><p><strong>2016: The Free Trial Reminder Experiment</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fTpYyZM_pvOCBX6V\" /></figure><p>Netflix’s non-member page is the store window for the service.

When do I use this knife?”\nThese five-percenters gunk up the experience and make it harder to use. And zillions of edge cases start popping up: “Hey! Why can’t I use “Party” on devices other than my laptop?!” or “How do I execute “Party” using voice on an Amazon Show device?”\nNot All Good Ideas Benefit the Brand\nWhy won’t Netflix party? For more than two decades, Netflix has been building a product that delivers on the brand promise “Movie Enjoyment Made Easy.”\nThink for a moment about the experience of forming a Netflix Party. First, you need to choose a movie everyone likes. Then, you agree on a time to watch. Finally, you hope the experience of watching a TV show/movie with friends somehow overcomes the downsides (your friends’ lame banter and the hesitancy you had about this movie choice at this particular time).\nNetflix understands this. That’s why they give premium members the ability for family members to watch four simultaneous streams. Kristen and I can watch a movie in our bedroom, while Kelsey watches in her room, and Britney is on the living room couch. That’s “Movie Enjoyment Made Easy.” No debate about what movie to watch and when! And that’s why I think it’s unlikely that you’ll see Netflix Party implemented anytime soon.\nThanks for reading,\nGib\nGibson Biddle\ngibsonbiddle.com\nPS. Click here to give feedback on this essay.

An objective describes<em> what </em>is to be achieved. The key results state <em>how</em> we accomplish the objective. Let’s say, for example, that the objective is to “increase engagement.” The key results might then be “simplify user journey A” and “enhance feature alpha.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OKRs can be used to create cascading goals—goals that are systematically linked. This is done by using higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as the following example shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png\" alt=\"Sample Cascading OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16705\" width=\"666\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-300x71.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-768x183.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Cascading OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the key result “simplify user journey alpha” becomes an objective with two new key results, “remove user journey step two” and “improve performance by 10%” thereby connecting the two OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to note that OKRs were originally invented by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970ies to facilitate “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent execution</a>,” that is, to help people set hard, measurable goals and to be able to clearly determine if these have been met.

Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png\" alt=\"Cascading Product Management Goals\" class=\"wp-image-16704\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-768x476.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals.

A product goal, finally, helps determine the right <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision.

In the month of November, the goal is to write a 50,000-word novel. (Very quickly, you realize this averages out to 1,667 words a day for 30 days.)</p><p>When I first heard of NaNoWriMo in college, I was instantly swept by the ingenuity of the concept. I’m not one to run an actual marathon, but this felt like the mental equivalent of one: intense, but capped. Extreme yet intoxicating. It felt like stepping into a creative blizzard and emerging at the end with something tangible: the actual bones of a story.</p><blockquote>Here’s the thing: we all have stories to tell.</blockquote><p>Perspectives, parables, proposals, lessons, fantasies — they all live within us, in the dark depths of the mind’s ocean. Writing is the process of fishing these out. It’s the extraction of personal truth, bottled into little black squiggles on crisp white paper. These words help us sweep chaos into order, knit pain into opportunity, multiply the power of great ideas. They help us be known.</p><p>Entire religions, governments and innovations have been constructed from a few pieces of writing. The reading of someone else’s words is the closest thing we have to being able to occupy their mind for a few brief minutes or hours.</p><p>But your writing doesn’t have to be read by someone else for it to be worthwhile.</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of words of my earliest novels have seen no eyes but my own. The extraction process, especially during those Novembers, was sloppy. I often didn’t know what I wanted to say, or the sentences were dull, or the plot meandered like a lost child, or the characters changed histories midway through.</p><p>I failed in my dream of being a published novelist, and there were times when I wondered at all that effort — all those plot holes I tried to mend, the sentences I tried to shape, all those November nights lost in a flurry of typing — what was the point, if nobody was going to read them?</p><p>But now, more than a decade later, I reap the bountiful harvest.</p><p>What is a few hundred thousand wasted words when I have written millions more since then?</p><p>I am a product designer and manager by profession, but oh, how I write. Daily e-mails debating the pros and cons of specific product decisions; mission statements and company values; new strategies and organizational updates; promotion criteria and primers for new employees; letters to myself that turned into widely read blog that turned into a bestselling management book.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that the most important thing in writing is to <em>just get the words down — </em>the discipline of 1667 a day. The words don’t have to be good; they just have to <em>be</em>. Because once they’re down, you have something you can evolve, respond to, and polish.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that writing, reading and thinking go hand-in-hand. As my words sharpened, so did the clarity of my ideas. What used to be an amorphous haze of emotions and fragments now, more often than not, present themselves as a series of structured thoughts.</p><p>I approach reading with more depth as I consider all the choices the author made, and why. I express myself more honesty and connect better with readers. I am learning, over and over again, that writing regularly has many advantages in life.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that writing is fun when you do it for yourself. There is joy in the invention that happens on the page. There is delight in unwrapping a tiny piece of ourselves only to discover what’s behind it is universal.</p><p>For all of you doing this year’s NaNoWriMo — congratulations as you cross into the final day!

In the month of November, the goal is to write a 50,000-word novel. (Very quickly, you realize this averages out to 1,667 words a day for 30 days.)\nWhen I first heard of NaNoWriMo in college, I was instantly swept by the ingenuity of the concept. I’m not one to run an actual marathon, but this felt like the mental equivalent of one: intense, but capped. Extreme yet intoxicating. It felt like stepping into a creative blizzard and emerging at the end with something tangible: the actual bones of a story.\nHere’s the thing: we all have stories to tell.\nPerspectives, parables, proposals, lessons, fantasies — they all live within us, in the dark depths of the mind’s ocean. Writing is the process of fishing these out. It’s the extraction of personal truth, bottled into little black squiggles on crisp white paper. These words help us sweep chaos into order, knit pain into opportunity, multiply the power of great ideas. They help us be known.\nEntire religions, governments and innovations have been constructed from a few pieces of writing. The reading of someone else’s words is the closest thing we have to being able to occupy their mind for a few brief minutes or hours.\nBut your writing doesn’t have to be read by someone else for it to be worthwhile.\nThe hundreds of thousands of words of my earliest novels have seen no eyes but my own. The extraction process, especially during those Novembers, was sloppy. I often didn’t know what I wanted to say, or the sentences were dull, or the plot meandered like a lost child, or the characters changed histories midway through.\nI failed in my dream of being a published novelist, and there were times when I wondered at all that effort — all those plot holes I tried to mend, the sentences I tried to shape, all those November nights lost in a flurry of typing — what was the point, if nobody was going to read them?\nBut now, more than a decade later, I reap the bountiful harvest.\nWhat is a few hundred thousand wasted words when I have written millions more since then?\nI am a product designer and manager by profession, but oh, how I write. Daily e-mails debating the pros and cons of specific product decisions; mission statements and company values; new strategies and organizational updates; promotion criteria and primers for new employees; letters to myself that turned into widely read blog that turned into a bestselling management book.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that the most important thing in writing is to just get the words down — the discipline of 1667 a day. The words don’t have to be good; they just have to be. Because once they’re down, you have something you can evolve, respond to, and polish.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that writing, reading and thinking go hand-in-hand. As my words sharpened, so did the clarity of my ideas. What used to be an amorphous haze of emotions and fragments now, more often than not, present themselves as a series of structured thoughts.\nI approach reading with more depth as I consider all the choices the author made, and why. I express myself more honesty and connect better with readers. I am learning, over and over again, that writing regularly has many advantages in life.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that writing is fun when you do it for yourself. There is joy in the invention that happens on the page. There is delight in unwrapping a tiny piece of ourselves only to discover what’s behind it is universal.\nFor all of you doing this year’s NaNoWriMo — congratulations as you cross into the final day! The end is in sight. Looking back, I hope you’ll find the journey as rewarding as I did. And for those who aren’t, there’s always next year… or next month!

For example, a product manager might determine the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/ten-product-backlog-tips/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1301\">product backlog</a>, the development work, and the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10199\">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle, Process Oly\" class=\"wp-image-16650\" width=\"512\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png 896w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-300x259.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-768x663.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14245\">extend the product’s life cycle</a>, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">too big and heterogenous</a>, the value proposition might <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">not be compelling enough</a>, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\">Strategize</a></em>. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to &#8220;Product Strategy&#8221; in the picture above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goals</a></em>. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog</a>. Then create just enough <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready product backlog items</a> to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-scrum-cycle/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3854\">best suited to create a new product or a major product update</a>, I&#8217;ve added another little cycle between &#8220;Product Backlog&#8221; and &#8220;Product&#8221; on the picture above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release burndown chart</a>. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are <em>engagement</em>, <em>retention</em>, <em>product quality</em>, <em>team motivation</em>, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, <em>revenue</em> and <em>cost</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the KPIs and the development progress data to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">review the product strategy</a> and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\" target=\"_blank\">pivot</a>, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have now completed the cycle and started another one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Involve the Right People</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Systematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a> and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">development progress</a>, and updating the plans. Inviting people to contribute to strategic decisions makes it more likely that they understand and support them.  What’s more, this allows you to leverage their expertise, which makes it more likely that you will make the right decisions. If you work on a larger product and in a scaled environment, include the product people who work with you, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature owners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great way to engage the key stakeholders and development team members is to run a collaborative workshop, be it online or in the office. Ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or another experienced facilitator to help prepare the workshop and facilitate the session. This includes establishing ground rules, selecting a helpful <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule like consent</a>, and ensuring that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. (You can find more advice on collaborative decision-making in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Involving the stakeholder and development team members in the decision-making process puts collaboration at the centre of the strategy cycle, as the picture below shows. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-1024x880.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle\" class=\"wp-image-16641\" width=\"635\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-1024x880.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-300x258.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-768x660.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle.png 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All models are wrong, but some are useful,&#8221; as George Box once observed.

If that is not the case, then you might have to adjust the product roadmap, which might even trigger an adjustment of the product strategy. Similarly, if your product backlog experiences significant changes, as you find out, for instance, that a key feature is not required or has to be replaced, you should <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">consider the impact on the product roadmap</a> and update it as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, you should not forget to engage in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery</a>, which includes frequently monitoring new trends and the competition. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/establishing-an-effective-product-strategy-process/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14705\">As I have suggested before</a>, spend at least half a day per week carrying out continuous discovery and strategy work including reviewing relevant trends and keeping an eye on the competition.

In this article, I explain how you can use the cycle to join up product strategy, product roadmap, KPIs, product backlog, and development work, and I discuss the role stakeholders and development team members play in making effective strategic product decisions.\nThe post The Product Strategy Cycle appeared first on Roman Pichler.","guid":"https://www.romanpichler.com/?p=16635","categories":["Process: Product Discovery, Agile, Scrum","Product Vision and Strategy","product discovery","scrum","teamwork"],"isoDate":"2020-11-03T08:05:57.000Z"},{"creator":"Roman Pichler","title":"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery","link":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/","pubDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:39:03 +0000","content:encoded":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" title=\"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/clark-tibbs-oqStl2L5oxI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"something great\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h2>What is Product Discovery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Product discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> should be developed and offered. This increases the chances of creating a product that users actually want and need and achieving product success. Carrying out product discovery involves answering the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the specific value the product should create for the users and customers? What problem should it solve, or which benefit should it create?</li><li>Which market and market segment should the product address? Who are the users and who are the customers?</li><li>What makes the product stand out? How will it differ from competing offerings?</li><li>What are its business goals? How will it benefit the company? For example, generate revenue or meet a profit margin, reduce cost, or develop the brand?</li><li>What business model will it use in order to achieve the business goals, including revenue sources, cost factors, and channels?</li><li>Will the product make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-ethics/\">positive impact on people’s lives, the wider society, and the planet, or will it at least not cause any harm</a>?</li><li>How might people use the product? What are the major touch points? What kind of user experience (UX) should the product give rise to?</li><li>How can the product be built? What architecture patterns and technologies may be used?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to answer the questions above, you may want to use techniques such as direct observation, user interviews, prototyping, creating a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">strategy canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>, and you may capture some of them using a tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a>. Whatever you do, I suggest that you follow Steve Blank’s advice and “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/\" target=\"_blank\">get out of the building</a>”. Meeting users and customers, at least in form of a video call, not only helps you validate your assumptions and develop new ideas. It also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\">empathise with the individuals</a> and to better understand their perspectives and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it helpful to distinguish two types of product discovery: timeboxed and continuous discovery. Let’s look at timeboxed product discovery first.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeboxed Product Di<strong>scovery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you create a brand-new product or when you make bigger changes to an existing one, like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\">taking it to a new market</a>, you will benefit from using a dedicated, timeboxed product discovery period. This results in an innovation process like the one shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png\" alt=\"product discovery vs product development\" class=\"wp-image-16536\" width=\"561\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-300x92.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-768x234.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development.png 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, product discovery precedes product development. The former focuses on understanding if and why a product should be created or updated. The latter largely determines how the product should be developed. This includes discovering the right UX design and functionality and making the right technical decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I have purposefully drawn discovery and development as overlapping, as I find it helpful to address major UX and technical risks as part of the discovery work—without making the mistake of using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front\" target=\"_blank\">big design upfront (BDU)</a>. Addressing these risks ensures that the development team has the right knowledge to hit the ground running <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8888\">when starting development</a>. Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> and business model,</li><li>Actionable <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a> that implements the strategy,</li><li>Initial product backlog that captures the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-lean-product-backlog-variation-and-overburden/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"591\">necessary product details</a>,</li><li>A high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\">spikes</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/discovery-and-strategizing-team-1024x489.png\" alt=\"Product Discovery Team\" class=\"wp-image-14741\" width=\"555\" height=\"262\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\">understand why the product is being created or updated</a>. The latter will <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution</a>. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision</a>, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Co</strong>ntinuous Product Discovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Review the product performance using the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\">key performance indicators</a>. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?</li><li>Look for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.</li><li>Keep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate? Job postings can help you guess your competitors’ plans. Reviewing their products will tell you <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">if your product is still sufficiently differentiated</a>.</li><li>Follow the developments at your own company: Are there any changes to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/business-strategy-and-product-strategy/\">business strategy</a>? And if so, what are the consequences for your product? </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, regularly hold <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">collaborative strategy reviews</a>, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb. Assess the product strategy and product roadmap together with development team representatives and key stakeholders. These are ideally the same people who participated in the timeboxed discovery work and who helped you create the current product strategy and roadmap. As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you manage a larger product and you work in a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\">scaled environment</a>, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature and component owners or SAFe product owners</a>, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\">A Brief Guide to Product Discovery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"What is Product Discovery?\nProduct discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why a product should be developed and offered.

When I first encountered this story as a wide-eyed immigrant kid, I loved the idea that a smart, resourceful little girl could one-up the bullies. And not just kid bullies, but the the All-Powerful Adult Authority Bullies! Who doesn’t dream of that?</p><p>It wasn’t just Matilda. Looking back now, I see that so many of the stories I adored back then glorified the power of the individual. <em>You</em> could be the Chosen One. <em>You </em>could vanquish your foes, save the day, or turn a sticky situation into a happy ending. It doesn’t matter if you grew up in an orphanage or your childhood was absolutely miserable. That just made you more capable and deserving of the final rewards.</p><p>The appeal of that message is like honey when we’re small and powerless. But now that I have kids of my own, I can’t help thinking: <em>What will be the impact of Matilda’s parents treating her so poorly and then essentially abandoning her?</em></p><p>How will this affect her ability to trust others? How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?</p><p>It’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.</p><p><strong><em>“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — </em></strong>attributed to Sengcan</p><p>One of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:</p><ul><li>No situational problem-solving questions (“<em>What would do if X happened?</em>”)</li><li>No questions about my past roles (<em>“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”</em>)</li><li>No technical questions</li><li><em>Only</em> questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.</li></ul><p>I thought this was a fascinating interesting technique. I was tossed questions like <em>“What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome in your life?”</em> and <em>“Where did your drive come from?”</em> It felt as if the interviewer was trying to open my skull to discern what made me tick. Would my mindset fit in with this particular team? Would I be compelled to shoot for the same stars?</p><p>The whole thing got me wondering: what <em>does</em> make us tick? Certainly there is our genetic make-up. Any parent with multiple kids (me included) will happily talk you to sleep about how different their offspring are. My grandma likes to remind me that I was a hard-to-raise kid, the impish, rebellious sort, and my daughter got this “gene” but my son didn’t.</p><p>But increasingly, I believe much of my thinking and behavior is shaped by the thousands of circumstances outside my direct control.</p><p>What was the biggest challenge I had to overcome in my life?</p><p>How to feel like I belonged when, as a six-year-old, I boarded a plane to the United States alone to meet parents who were strangers to me.

I’m Julie Zhuo. I help companies scale and build people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a popular management book. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. The Looking Glass is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.\n\nOne glorious thing about having an almost six-year-old is that we’ve started to read some of my favorite childhood books together.\nRecently, we read Matilda by Roald Dahl. When I first encountered this story as a wide-eyed immigrant kid, I loved the idea that a smart, resourceful little girl could one-up the bullies. And not just kid bullies, but the the All-Powerful Adult Authority Bullies! Who doesn’t dream of that?\nIt wasn’t just Matilda. Looking back now, I see that so many of the stories I adored back then glorified the power of the individual. You could be the Chosen One. You could vanquish your foes, save the day, or turn a sticky situation into a happy ending. It doesn’t matter if you grew up in an orphanage or your childhood was absolutely miserable. That just made you more capable and deserving of the final rewards.\nThe appeal of that message is like honey when we’re small and powerless. But now that I have kids of my own, I can’t help thinking: What will be the impact of Matilda’s parents treating her so poorly and then essentially abandoning her?\nHow will this affect her ability to trust others? How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?\nIt’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.\n“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — attributed to Sengcan\nOne of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:\n\nNo situational problem-solving questions (“What would do if X happened?”)\nNo questions about my past roles (“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”)\nNo technical questions\nOnly questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.\n\nI thought this was a fascinating interesting technique. I was tossed questions like “What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome in your life?” and “Where did your drive come from?” It felt as if the interviewer was trying to open my skull to discern what made me tick. Would my mindset fit in with this particular team? Would I be compelled to shoot for the same stars?\nThe whole thing got me wondering: what does make us tick? Certainly there is our genetic make-up. Any parent with multiple kids (me included) will happily talk you to sleep about how different their offspring are. My grandma likes to remind me that I was a hard-to-raise kid, the impish, rebellious sort, and my daughter got this “gene” but my son didn’t.\nBut increasingly, I believe much of my thinking and behavior is shaped by the thousands of circumstances outside my direct control.\nWhat was the biggest challenge I had to overcome in my life?\nHow to feel like I belonged when, as a six-year-old, I boarded a plane to the United States alone to meet parents who were strangers to me. How to fit in when my classmates spoke of camping and tooth fairies and trampolines as they ate their PB&J while I picked at my “weird Chinese leftovers” and wondered what they meant. How to prove myself worthy of years of sacrifice.\nThis constant yearning to belong explains so much about my behavior today, in ways both big and small. It’s why I’m fanatical about celebrating traditions. You better believe I’ve got a stack of mooncakes for this week’s Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, and my kids’ Tooth Fairy writes long letters about good dental hygiene. It’s why I avoid engaging in public conflicts on Twitter and elsewhere. It’s why I’m determined to prove myself over and over again, sometimes past the point where it serves me.\nMy family runs deep in my roots as well. Every few months, I’ll realize with fresh shock that I am doing something just as my mom does, despite my deep-seated narrative that I’m SO incredibly different from her. For example, earlier this year it hit me that my default tendency is to believe there is an objective “best” path forward in any situation, which is how she sees the world. But this is not my intention. Once I recognized this, I could start to unwind the thought pattern and remind myself that often we are choosing from many fulfilling paths, or choosing the one that best matches our needs at a given moment in time. Sometimes there is simply no such thing as “objectively best.” Chance plays a huge role in specific outcomes anyway, so why not just enjoy the journey?\nUnderstand the roots, and you can understand the body. I know one person who never locks their doors because they grew up in a warm, close-knit community. I know another who is adamant about installing security features because they’ve experienced break-ins before. I know decorated former athletes who to this day are incredibly motivated by the idea of winning; I know others with losing Little League records who care far more about the players than the score.\nWhen we’ve been badly hurt by those we love, we find it difficult to trust again; when we’re repeatedly shown a vision of what “good” looks like, that influences our North Star. We treat people the way we’ve been treated. The body always keeps the score.\nSome of the explorations of one’s roots are joyful and heartwarming, some are dark. Some are best done with a trained therapist or medical professional. I am sure I will be unearthing my roots for the rest of my life, and I’m glad for it. Our past doesn’t define use, and we can always change for the better.\nBut the better I understand where I came from, the more content I become; the sharper the future seems.\nHow well do we understand our roots?\nIf I asked you to describe yourself, I bet you’d have a well-practiced answer for me. You’d tell me about your interests, your work, your childhood, your family.\nBut personal stories are complex and richly layered. My own answers to the same questions evolve year over year.

Fluff gets eroded away.\nEvery six months or so, I try to ask myself the same things:\n\nWhat kinds of people do you admire and hope to emulate? Why?\nWhat do you love about yourself? Why do you love those things?\nWhat do you dislike about yourself? Why do you think you feel that way?\nWhat do you consider the greatest challenges in your life? How did you respond?\nWhat are some recent examples of things you tried and failed at?

We can get a peek into the thoughts and lifestyles of practically anyone we’re interested in, whether they’re top epidemiologists, activists, politicians, influencers or innovators. We can find kindred spirits we’ve never met before that share our undying love of ramen and Death Note and wacky real estate listings. With just a few <em>Follows</em>, we can tumble down the rabbit hole of our curiosity.</p><p>But with this access comes a belief that just because we see more, we can also come to better conclusions about more topics — whether wearing masks is necessary, whether saying or doing X is deplorable, whether TikTok is good or bad, whether a certain executive should be fired, whether designers should code/do woodworking/wear top hats.</p><p>We’re entitled to our own opinions, of course, but in reading through so many of these debates, I find myself wondering:</p><h4><em>Is social media actually making us better informed?</em></h4><p>Here’s what it feels like sometimes: you and I are looking at a picture in the distance. We’re standing in different spots, so parts of our view are blocked.</p><p>You say: “This picture has wonderful blue sky tones.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_zLhqqEquD8tSG5J.png\" /></figure><p>And I say: “What are you talking about? There’s so much exquisite detail in these little vignettes that are totally orange!”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*erP_Rw2g_tUFVtnm.png\" /></figure><p>And a third acquaintance chimes in and says: “You’re both wrong. This picture is about dudes reading.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n6lQkKx6w9RQ6eNm.png\" /></figure><p>And some other random person on the Internet is like: “You all suck. I’m an expert, and architecture is what makes this 💯.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9XikEWm13pccTw0X.png\" /></figure><h4>Who is right?</h4><p>Well, everybody.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6fswlaSHr-3WzVh5.png\" /></figure><p>None of the observations are patently false. But the fact that we’re arguing about them is ridiculous. We’re all reporting the picture as we see it, but we each see such a small slice.</p><p>Some of us who have spent far more energy — years or decades, maybe — in understanding a thing might have have uncovered more of the picture, but even then, every perspective has blind spots.</p><p>One of my great frustrations with social media today is that it’s so hard to zoom out and gain an appreciation for the complexity of a given topic. Short, Tweet-like posts constrain observations to these micro-squares, stripping them of context and nuance. Covid hits, and suddenly it seems like everyone and their dog is an expert on how to deal with pandemics.</p><p>The problem gets even worse when you throw bad actors into the mix who intentionally lie and mislead. Now we have to deal with a bunch of voices claiming that this picture is actually about Martians and submitting false pixels as evidence.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xSSna_WGnsohipzz.png\" /></figure><p>Putting bad actors aside for a second, I suspect most posters on social media <em>are</em> describing their little view rectangles as they see it.</p><p>We may disagree on how representative that rectangle is — does a few guys holding books make <em>reading</em> the most salient theme? Is architecture really why this picture is so famous, or is it the dynamism of the figures, the noble subject matter, or the sheer scale?</p><p>But assuming the other party is stupid or dishonest or wicked for pointing out that they see blue clouds is not helping us understand the image any better. It’s just causing us to waste time and energy.</p><p>It’s why I struggle to agree or disagree with one-line takes on social media, or why I find writing short, pithy tweets exceedingly challenging. Everything that sounds like a sweet aphorism feels right in some contexts and wrong in others. Is Tiktok good or bad? Good for some, bad for others. Should a certain executive be fired? The people who know the most should judge. Should designers code? It depends on the designer and their goals.</p><p>Unfortunately, “It depends” is a dull answer. Nobody reshares “It depends.” And the long explanations summarizing centuries of critical analyses for why “The School of Athens” is such a famous painting is simply tl;dr for most of us.</p><p>Our human brain craves villains and heroes, conflicts and denouements, the entirety of a story heard and judgement rendered in the time it takes for a quarantine lunch to heat up. Is it any wonder why our communication systems have evolved to ever shorter and shorter snippets of narrative? We went from the book to the blog to the tweet; the movie to the YouTube episode to the TikTok video.</p><p>And yet, “It depends” is often the path to real wisdom. It invites more questions, leads to more of the picture being filled in. It’s not sexy, but actual learning and problem solving rarely is. It’s the spiritual sibling to all those things we rationally know are good for us but struggle to choose: the carrots over the chips; the workout shoes over the couch; meaningful time with loved ones over mindless scrolling of blue screens.</p><p><em>Is social media actually making us better informed?</em> Maybe a better question to ask is:</p><h4>How can social media systems better incentivize informedness?</h4><p>I’ll throw out a proposal: Give <strong>verified users</strong> the <strong>ability to determine</strong> if a particular post needs more <strong>factual context</strong>. If <strong>enough viewers</strong> flag something as needing more context, <strong>factual context</strong> automatically appears next to the post.</p><p>Let’s dive into this a bit more:</p><p><strong>Why verified users?</strong> Given the prevalence of bots and coordinated misinformation campaigns, why not extend identity verification beyond just advertisers and blue-check celebrities to everyone? Make it easy to create an account and get started, but if you want to grow your influence, let’s make sure you’re a real person. Imagine capping your post’s distribution or limiting your ability to send engagement signals to the system (in the form of clicks, reports, votes, etc) unless you provide identification.</p><p><strong>Why give people the ability to determine?</strong> Empowering a vast group of people to add context to content is a lot more democratic and scalable than a small, centralized body making unilateral decisions about what posts should stay up or go down. Plus, we all know the gray zone is vast. Some posts don’t violate policies but cherry-pick certain facts and omit others in ways that distort the picture. Give people the power to fill in the blanks.</p><p><strong>Why factual context?</strong> This is the fuzziest part of the proposal, because facts are notoriously tricky to define. Even if we agree on the facts (“who did what when?”), the way they are presented can favor certain interpretations over others. The proposal here is to let verified users browse a database of approved factual statements from independent fact-checkers and submit them to be included along with the original post.</p><p><strong>Why automatically trigger when enough users do this?</strong> In order for a system to feel democratic, the rules for how it works need to be transparent. The trigger could be some combination of % of users who saw the post and flagged it and total number of viewers. The more a post is seen, the more scrutiny it should receive.</p><p><strong>Why is this proposal awesome</strong>? I make no claims that this proposal is awesome. I share it because I hope to inspire critique and alternatives. This is where I throw you a heaping pile of caveats — that the proposal has holes and may be impractical and may lead to new vectors of abuse and gamification. Complexifying an already-complex system is a fool’s errand, and throwing more things in front of people doesn’t mean they’ll absorb it. But if you think this solution sucks and have a better one, share it! Or if parts of this proposal inspire new ideas, by all means build upon them.</p><h4>Is social media more good than bad?</h4><p>Depends on who you ask. The prevailing narratives, like Pokemon, have gone through so many forms already. Once, many hailed social media as the harbinger of democracy. Now, it’s blamed for the erosion of it. If you ask me, my answer is <em>Yes, social media is more good than bad</em>. Information travels today at unheard of speeds, much of it to strengthen relationships, nurture communities, spread ideas, and accelerate innovation. But the same tools also sow division, disguise truth, and enable crime. Our experiences with social media reflect the good and bad of humanity. In our lives, we’re somebody’s demon and somebody else’s angel. Still, I choose to believe that <em>we</em> are more good than bad.</p><p>And yet. Social media tools can and should improve. Between the walls of “free speech” and “make the platforms safer” lies a fertile ground of possibilities. I am reminded of a school cafeteria design I heard about once, where the problem to be solved was: “How can schools incentive healthier eating?”</p><p><em>Get rid of all those flaming hot cheetoes!</em> you might think. <em>Slap nutritional labels on everything!</em> Instead, they kept the exact same lunch options but made the unhealthy stuff harder to access. Ice cream was put behind a closed, opaque door. Water lived next to the cash register while soda hung out in a different section of the cafeteria. Plates were smaller in size.</p><p>Guess what?

Should Rick be fired? Should designers wear top hats? Also: How can social media systems better incentivize informedness?\n👋 Hi! I’m Julie Zhuo. I help companies scale and build people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a popular management book. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. The Looking Glass is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.\nOne of the great gifts of social media is the way it expands our understanding of the world.\nIt used to be that our exposure to facts and opinions came from the dozens of people we see regularly in real life — besties, those colleagues we do Taco Tuesdays with, our parents and Uncle Paul and Cousin Maria, those high-school bandmates that we see once a year — along with the handful of TV channels, books or newspapers.\nToday, thanks to social media, those dozens of opinions have become hundreds or thousands. We can get a peek into the thoughts and lifestyles of practically anyone we’re interested in, whether they’re top epidemiologists, activists, politicians, influencers or innovators. We can find kindred spirits we’ve never met before that share our undying love of ramen and Death Note and wacky real estate listings. With just a few Follows, we can tumble down the rabbit hole of our curiosity.\nBut with this access comes a belief that just because we see more, we can also come to better conclusions about more topics — whether wearing masks is necessary, whether saying or doing X is deplorable, whether TikTok is good or bad, whether a certain executive should be fired, whether designers should code/do woodworking/wear top hats.\nWe’re entitled to our own opinions, of course, but in reading through so many of these debates, I find myself wondering:\nIs social media actually making us better informed?\nHere’s what it feels like sometimes: you and I are looking at a picture in the distance. We’re standing in different spots, so parts of our view are blocked.\nYou say: “This picture has wonderful blue sky tones.”\n\nAnd I say: “What are you talking about? There’s so much exquisite detail in these little vignettes that are totally orange!”\n\nAnd a third acquaintance chimes in and says: “You’re both wrong. This picture is about dudes reading.”\n\nAnd some other random person on the Internet is like: “You all suck. I’m an expert, and architecture is what makes this 💯.”\n\nWho is right?\nWell, everybody.\n\nNone of the observations are patently false. But the fact that we’re arguing about them is ridiculous. We’re all reporting the picture as we see it, but we each see such a small slice.\nSome of us who have spent far more energy — years or decades, maybe — in understanding a thing might have have uncovered more of the picture, but even then, every perspective has blind spots.\nOne of my great frustrations with social media today is that it’s so hard to zoom out and gain an appreciation for the complexity of a given topic. Short, Tweet-like posts constrain observations to these micro-squares, stripping them of context and nuance. Covid hits, and suddenly it seems like everyone and their dog is an expert on how to deal with pandemics.\nThe problem gets even worse when you throw bad actors into the mix who intentionally lie and mislead. Now we have to deal with a bunch of voices claiming that this picture is actually about Martians and submitting false pixels as evidence.\n\nPutting bad actors aside for a second, I suspect most posters on social media are describing their little view rectangles as they see it.\nWe may disagree on how representative that rectangle is — does a few guys holding books make reading the most salient theme? Is architecture really why this picture is so famous, or is it the dynamism of the figures, the noble subject matter, or the sheer scale?\nBut assuming the other party is stupid or dishonest or wicked for pointing out that they see blue clouds is not helping us understand the image any better. It’s just causing us to waste time and energy.\nIt’s why I struggle to agree or disagree with one-line takes on social media, or why I find writing short, pithy tweets exceedingly challenging. Everything that sounds like a sweet aphorism feels right in some contexts and wrong in others. Is Tiktok good or bad? Good for some, bad for others. Should a certain executive be fired? The people who know the most should judge. Should designers code? It depends on the designer and their goals.\nUnfortunately, “It depends” is a dull answer. Nobody reshares “It depends.” And the long explanations summarizing centuries of critical analyses for why “The School of Athens” is such a famous painting is simply tl;dr for most of us.\nOur human brain craves villains and heroes, conflicts and denouements, the entirety of a story heard and judgement rendered in the time it takes for a quarantine lunch to heat up. Is it any wonder why our communication systems have evolved to ever shorter and shorter snippets of narrative? We went from the book to the blog to the tweet; the movie to the YouTube episode to the TikTok video.\nAnd yet, “It depends” is often the path to real wisdom. It invites more questions, leads to more of the picture being filled in. It’s not sexy, but actual learning and problem solving rarely is. It’s the spiritual sibling to all those things we rationally know are good for us but struggle to choose: the carrots over the chips; the workout shoes over the couch; meaningful time with loved ones over mindless scrolling of blue screens.\nIs social media actually making us better informed? Maybe a better question to ask is:\nHow can social media systems better incentivize informedness?\nI’ll throw out a proposal: Give verified users the ability to determine if a particular post needs more factual context. If enough viewers flag something as needing more context, factual context automatically appears next to the post.\nLet’s dive into this a bit more:\nWhy verified users? Given the prevalence of bots and coordinated misinformation campaigns, why not extend identity verification beyond just advertisers and blue-check celebrities to everyone? Make it easy to create an account and get started, but if you want to grow your influence, let’s make sure you’re a real person. Imagine capping your post’s distribution or limiting your ability to send engagement signals to the system (in the form of clicks, reports, votes, etc) unless you provide identification.\nWhy give people the ability to determine? Empowering a vast group of people to add context to content is a lot more democratic and scalable than a small, centralized body making unilateral decisions about what posts should stay up or go down. Plus, we all know the gray zone is vast. Some posts don’t violate policies but cherry-pick certain facts and omit others in ways that distort the picture. Give people the power to fill in the blanks.\nWhy factual context? This is the fuzziest part of the proposal, because facts are notoriously tricky to define. Even if we agree on the facts (“who did what when?”), the way they are presented can favor certain interpretations over others. The proposal here is to let verified users browse a database of approved factual statements from independent fact-checkers and submit them to be included along with the original post.\nWhy automatically trigger when enough users do this? In order for a system to feel democratic, the rules for how it works need to be transparent. The trigger could be some combination of % of users who saw the post and flagged it and total number of viewers. The more a post is seen, the more scrutiny it should receive.\nWhy is this proposal awesome? I make no claims that this proposal is awesome. I share it because I hope to inspire critique and alternatives. This is where I throw you a heaping pile of caveats — that the proposal has holes and may be impractical and may lead to new vectors of abuse and gamification. Complexifying an already-complex system is a fool’s errand, and throwing more things in front of people doesn’t mean they’ll absorb it. But if you think this solution sucks and have a better one, share it! Or if parts of this proposal inspire new ideas, by all means build upon them.\nIs social media more good than bad?\nDepends on who you ask. The prevailing narratives, like Pokemon, have gone through so many forms already. Once, many hailed social media as the harbinger of democracy. Now, it’s blamed for the erosion of it. If you ask me, my answer is Yes, social media is more good than bad. Information travels today at unheard of speeds, much of it to strengthen relationships, nurture communities, spread ideas, and accelerate innovation. But the same tools also sow division, disguise truth, and enable crime. Our experiences with social media reflect the good and bad of humanity. In our lives, we’re somebody’s demon and somebody else’s angel. Still, I choose to believe that we are more good than bad.\nAnd yet. Social media tools can and should improve. Between the walls of “free speech” and “make the platforms safer” lies a fertile ground of possibilities. I am reminded of a school cafeteria design I heard about once, where the problem to be solved was: “How can schools incentive healthier eating?”\nGet rid of all those flaming hot cheetoes! you might think. Slap nutritional labels on everything! Instead, they kept the exact same lunch options but made the unhealthy stuff harder to access. Ice cream was put behind a closed, opaque door. Water lived next to the cash register while soda hung out in a different section of the cafeteria. Plates were smaller in size.\nGuess what? Kids ate better.\nWhat could we design to better incentive informedness? How can we make it easier to pursue the truth in wonderful collaborative fashion, as Raphael imagined in his masterpiece fresco?\nThere’s work to be done. I’m looking forward to the next chapter.","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ef227e726e5e","isoDate":"2020-09-02T14:30:40.000Z"},{"creator":"Roman Pichler","title":"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important","link":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 08:19:45 +0000","content:encoded":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/\" title=\"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrishna-flickr-e1590504925764-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ducks in a row\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h2>Step 1: Ensure that you know who the product is for and why people will want to use it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll never forget the day when I suggested to the product manager of a brand-new healthcare product to prioritise its features. The individual looked at me slightly bewildered and replied, &#8220;I can’t. They are all high-priority.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritisation requires deciding how important an item is. If everything is high priority, everything is equally important. This means in effect that nothing is a priority. But without clear priorities, the development team lacks direction, and there is only a slim chance of creating a successful product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common root cause of not being able to prioritise a product backlog is a lack of understanding of who the users of the product are and what specific value it should create for them. I find it not uncommon that features are added to the product backlog because a senior <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholder</a> demands it (HIPPO syndrome) or someone thinks it is a good idea (“let’s brainstorm some <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a>”). But <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> exists to generate value for the users and for the company providing it. If it is not clear who the users are and why they would want to interact with the product, it will be hard to decide which items should be in the product backlog and how important they are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate the risk of adding the wrong items to the product backlog, ensure that you have a validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> in place, no matter if you look after a brand-new or as an existing product. Such a strategy should clearly state the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The users and customers of the product so that it is clear who will benefit from it and who won’t;</li><li>The main problem the product should address or the primary benefit it should offer, or the main goal users will want to achieve with it;</li><li>The three to five features that will make it stand out from the crowd;</li><li>The specific benefits it should create for the business.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at a brief example and say that I want to create a product that helps people eat healthily. Then I could choose to address middle aged men who suffer from unhealthy eating habits and who don’t exercise enough. The benefit might be to reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The standout features might be to measure food sugar levels, analyse the user’s eating habits, and integrate with leading smart scales. The business goals, finally, might be to diversify my company and open up a new revenue stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you should be confident that your strategy is correct, and you should have data to support your view. In other words, you should have addressed the key assumptions and risks in the product strategy, and you should have carried out the necessary validation work. A tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a> helps you capture and validate your product strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Describe the outcome or benefit the product should create in the next few months</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a product strategy in place is great, but it is not enough to effectively prioritise a product backlog. What’s required is a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\">product goal</a> that is connected to the strategy and creates the right context to decide which backlog items are more important and which ones are less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create such a goal, ask yourself which outcome or benefit your product should achieve in the next, say, three to six months. What are the desired user and business benefits you want to create? Make sure that this goal is in line with the product strategy and that it helps create the desired user and business benefits. An example based on the sample strategy above would be &#8220;help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.&#8221; (Note that I have chosen a compound goal that captures the desired user and business benefits.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to take this idea further, derive several product goals from the product strategy for the next 12 months, and capture them on a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a>. This puts the goal chosen in context and communicates how the product is likely to evolve over a longer period. If you have a product roadmap, then ensure that it implements the overall product strategy. Consider reworking it so that it clearly states the desired outcomes your product should achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Remove all items from the product backlog that do not support the desired outcome</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, use the product goal you have chosen to delete all items from the product backlog that do not serve it. While this approach might sound radical, it ensures that your backlog becomes concise and focused. It avoids having items on the backlog that are speculative and may not create value, and maybe even more importantly, it facilitates prioritisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe that removing the product backlog items is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, then this may indicate that you lack the necessary <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">empowerment</a> and/or that the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\">stakeholders</a> do not buy into the overall product strategy and the specific product goal you have chosen. Involving the individuals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">decision-making process</a> can help address both issues. This allows the stakeholders to voice their ideas and concerns, and it makes it more likely that they understand and support important product decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to decide together with the stakeholders, then invite them to a meeting. Carefully prepare the session and choose a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule</a>, for instance, consent. Additionally, ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or another skilled facilitator to help run the meeting so that everyone is heard, and nobody dominates. (I offer more advice on securing stakeholder buy-in and decision-making in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Prioritise the remaining product backlog items</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now prioritise the remaining product backlog items. I recommend that you prioritise a new or significantly changed product backlog initially by risk, taking into account the user, technology, and business-related risks. Assess all backlog items together with the development team and move those to the top that carry the highest risk. This approach <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leveraging-failure-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13630\">accelerates learning</a> and it avoids failing late when there are less options to change course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, ensure that the high-priority items are &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>&#8220;, that the development team and you have a shared understanding of them, that the team can implement them in the next sprint, and that they are testable.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering what was up with the healthcare product I mentioned earlier.

Additionally, such a vision is hardly inspiring. A good vision exercises pull—it describes a future state that people want to bring about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong>: A confusion about what an effective product vision is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Describe the ultimate purpose of your product, the positive change the product should bring about like “healthy eating”. Think of the vision as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html\" target=\"_blank\">big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)</a> that inspires people and offers a continuity of purpose for the next five to ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\">8 Tips for Creating A Compelling Product Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Target Group is (too) Big and Heterogenous</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Everyone who owns a smartphone”, “Business users and consumers”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A very big and diverse target group makes it hard to formulate a crisp, compelling value proposition and strong standout features. It can also result in a large product backlog and high development cost: The greater the number of people who should benefit from your product is, the more diverse their needs are likely to be, and the more features are usually required to address them. Trying to offer a product that pleases everybody carries the risk of not doing a good job for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: A lack of understanding of users and their needs, lack of empowerment of the person in charge of the product, inappropriate growth strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Successful products are not built by agreeing on the smallest common denominator or trying to please powerful stakeholders. Instead, they require tough strategic decision and clear focus. Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank suggested</a>, particularly when you manage a new or young product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams</a>: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/market-segmentation-tips-for-product-managers/\">Market Segmentation Tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 59; <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 36.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor. Consequently, it will be hard to achieve the desired business benefits and monetise the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of understanding what problems users really face and what they really need; a target group that is too large and heterogenous, as discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the main reason for people to use the product, the primary benefit that the product should offer to the users or the main problem it should address. Another approach is to identify the main goal users will want to achieve by using the product or to find the primary job the product should do for them. Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order get to know the users, empathise with the individuals, and develop a thorough understanding of their needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 94, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs are Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy to use, calorie counter, works on iOS and Android”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When features—in the sense of product capabilities—are mistaken for needs, it is not clear why people should use the product, and the offering is likely to suffer from having a poor, unconvincing value proposition. Additionally, there is too much focus on the solution (“solutionising”), which is likely to limit the development team’s ability to come up with the best possible design and architecture options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Confusion about what a need is; a lack of understanding of the user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the <em>why</em>: Ask why people would want to use the product. What specific benefit will it offer, or which problem will it help solve? Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews. Additionally, describe the needs from the users’ perspective, for example, “help me achieve a healthy target weight” or “help me significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">What is a Digital Product: Section “Features and Components”</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs Statement is not Specific</strong> Enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Get fit&#8221;, &#8220;Feel better&#8221;, &#8220;Improve eating habits”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: It’s perfectly fine to start out with a broad needs statement.

Iterate over the product vision board and refine its contents, similar to how you would refine the product backlog and break bigger items into more specific ones. For instance, if getting fit is the desired benefit, then a refined and more specific needs statement might be “be able to run 10k”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 66.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>No Convincing Standout Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy-to-use user interface, calorie intake, barcode scanner”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Standout features ensure that your product is effectively differentiated: As their name suggests, they make your product stand out from the crowd, they give people a reason to choose it over competing offerings. If the features are weak, it will not be clear to prospective users why they should favour your product over alternatives, and it will be hard to market and sell the offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of market insight, lack of empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: To address the first cause, perform competitor research and apply a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">Strategy Canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>.

I’m the author of a </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567\"><em>popular management book</em></a><em>. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. </em><strong><em>The Looking Glass</em></strong><em> is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5_Xv5q_WfIXdhkIN.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Once upon a time, I received an important email in my inbox that alerted me to some distressing news.</p><p>Every six months, our company ran a wide-scale anonymous satisfaction survey that pretty much every single employee answered. If your team was big enough, you’d get your own breakout of the results for how your immediate team was feeling. I always looked forward to diving in and seeing what was going well and what wasn’t.</p><p>As my eyes scanned the various questions, graphs, and answers, one result in particular stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>Under the question “How often does your manager show care for you?” the chart that displayed the responses from my team was a mass of red. I had to read it a few times to ensure I wasn’t misunderstanding: <em>the majority of my team thought I didn’t show care for them?!</em></p><p>This was hard to process because of course I cared. I cared a lot! I took pride in helping my reports grow and thrive. I gave them challenging projects and frequent feedback because I wanted to see them succeed. And if there were ways in which I could help them — by hiring for their team, advocating for issues on their behalf, or pitching in on a tough project — I always showed up. How could they possibly think that I didn’t care?!</p><p>That night, I met a manager friend for dinner and poured my heart out to him. He listened and then gave me a diagnosis. “Julie,” he said, “Have you ever told your reports that you care about them? Or asked them how they’d like to be cared for?”</p><p>I searched my memories and came up short. He had a point. “Everyone’s wired differently,” he said. “So sometimes we struggle to understand each other. Maybe the way you show care and the way your reports perceive care are different. Everyone has their own preferences for how they like to operate and be treated.”</p><p>He was absolutely right. I took the feedback to better understand what “being cared for” meant to my reports. And I would learn this lesson time and time again — that even if you’re a good, experienced manager, even if you show up to work every day with confidence, you’re still going to fail to connect with others from time to time. You’ll still have misunderstandings or talk past each other.</p><p>Some of this will be due to cultural differences, or contrasting personalities, or because we simply have different perspectives and life experiences. Whatever the source, the more I understood about what mattered to my the people I worked with, the better of a colleague and manager I’d be. Similarly, the more my colleagues understood about how <em>I</em> worked, the fewer misunderstandings we’d have.</p><p>That’s where the exercise of creating a user manual comes in.</p><h4>A User Guide for You</h4><p>I started writing a “How to work with Julie” guide for my team about three or four years ago, and heard the phrase <em>User Guide</em> some time later. Instantly it stuck with me. When you buy a new camera, it comes with a little booklet that teaches you about the specifics of the gadget — what each button means, how to select the appropriate lighting, how to review the images.</p><p>A User Guide for a Person works in a similar way. It creates clarity on how you work — what you value, how you look at problems, what your blind spots or areas of growth are, and how to build trust with you.</p><p>It’s something you can give to your manager, the folks you work the closest with, or — if you are a manager — every new report who joins your team.</p><p>The key to a good User Guide is to make it as <em>specific to you as possible</em> (<a href=\"https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-candidates-companies\">check out this post on why that matters</a>). Leave out the generic fluff that everyone would agree with, like “<em>I get motivated when my work has impact.</em>” That doesn’t tell us anything, except that you’re not a cat. Can you be more specific and tell us what <em>kind</em> of impact is motivating to you (and what kind isn’t?)</p><p>The most effective User Guides contain snippets that might make you feel vulnerable, like you’re letting the team see you unplugged, in your PJs with rumpled hair. But vulnerability is the secret ingredient to trust. When you acknowledge your imperfections, you will receive far more rewards in the form of support, mentorship, and empathy. And you invite others to be more open with you as well.</p><p>I’ve included a User Guide template and my personal example as a starting point — feel free to modify to best suit your needs. Mine has been a living document over the years, honed through continual feedback that has shined new light on how I understand myself and my relationships. I hope yours gives you a similar gift.</p><p>Happy team-working!</p><h4><strong>Template: A User Guide To Working With &lt;Your Name&gt;</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://coda.io/@joulee/meet-julie\"><em>Use this template on Coda.io</em></a></p><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p><em>Why are you writing this user guide?

And I’m excited for all we’ll learn from each other! I already have high expectations that our collaboration together will yield some wonderful things :) That said, we are unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences and styles for how we like to work.</p><p>I’m writing this user guide to give you a better handle on me and my values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible. I encourage you to do the same and share your user guide with me as well!</p><h4><strong>How I view success</strong></h4><ul><li>A manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for her team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are people — hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; purpose — clarity on what success looks like; and process — clarity on how to best work. Of these three levers, I believe people is the most important.</li><li>Success is constantly learning and getting better. We can’t always control the results, and if we aim high we will sometimes fail. But no matter the outcome, there are always lessons to be mined. Those learnings are ours to keep forever.</li><li>The path to success matters as much as the outcome. Everyone gets lucky and unlucky sometimes. But if we’re good, our success will be sustainable because it’s our process that works.</li><li>It’s better to set ambitious goals that we don’t always meet, than to sell ourselves short.</li><li>We can always do and be better.</li><li>Success without integrity is like a car without an engine.</li></ul><h4><strong>How I communicate</strong></h4><ul><li>I am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk my thoughts out loud which can feel rambling. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or to be precise with action items.</li><li>Because a lot of my job is nurturing creativity, my preference is for others to come to the right solution with their own conviction, not to tell others what I think the right solution is. However, I recognize that sometimes the most pragmatic and efficient thing is to be clear with my opinion early on so we can resolve major misalignments. If I am not being clear and you worry we may not be seeing eye to eye, please let me know.</li><li>I like to be engaged in conversations and presentations and show respect to the speaker. I will often smile and nod along to encourage the speaker. It doesn’t mean I agree with everything that is being said.</li><li>I am continually working on being more direct, especially about concerns or things I don’t think are going well. I commit to giving you frequent feedback or suggestions that I think may help you. If it doesn’t feel like I am being direct enough, or if my feedback is not helpful, please let me know.</li><li>I place a lot of value on having a clear big-picture narrative and being able to to speak to the meaning behind the work, as well as what’s exciting about it. If you aren’t sure why we are working on something, please let me know.</li><li>I prefer email for asynchronous team communication. Please use email if you’re describing an issue with a good deal with context. I respond to most things within 2 work days, so if I’ve been slow, re-ping me as I do sometimes miss things. If something is urgent or easy to respond to, feel free to message me over chat, and allow me the rest of the day to respond.</li><li>If you feel something is better discussed with me in person, don’t hesitate to drop a note with what you’d like to talk about. If you are a direct report, I will try my best to move things around so we can meet as soon as possible — it’s extremely important to me that you feel you always have time when you need it. If you are not a direct report but I can be of help to you, then we’ll schedule time during the next available office hours block. Occasionally, I’ll lack the necessary context to be useful, and in those cases I will decline the meeting and suggest another person who would be better able to assist you.</li></ul><h4><strong>Things I do that may annoy you</strong></h4><ul><li>I am that archetype of the “high expectations Asian parent,” so I can seem demanding, critical, and never satisfied rather than supportive, encouraging, or empathetic. Since then, I’ve come to learn that different people respond better to different styles. Please know that I am always in your corner, and I care about you, even as I work on showing that better.</li><li>I am on the hyper-rational end of the emotional spectrum. This can be annoying when you share a problem or feeling with me, and I respond with a bunch of rationalized suggestions, when what the situation called for was listening and empathy. I am working on being better attuned to this.</li><li>I am generally more focused on inputs than outputs. This means that if there is a positive outcome, but the process in getting there didn’t seem sound or intentional to me, I might not see it as cause for celebration. This can be frustrating if you are more focused on outputs than inputs.</li><li>I am frequently late to meetings, like 1–5 minutes late. Sometimes there is a good reason, but 80% of the time, the reason is that I suck at punctuality, and need to get better at it. You should call me out when this happens.</li><li>I can fall into the bias of assuming everyone has the same context as I do, and as a result, not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly or as broadly as I should. Please remind me to provide more context if I do this.</li><li>Being a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics quickly, or who want to commit to plans and not change them.</li><li>Because I have a tendency to think long-term, I might give you impractical or complex suggestions when what you’re looking for is pragmatic, short-term options. Please remind me of the problem context if you feel my feedback is unhelpful or if you observe that I am trying to boil the ocean.</li><li>I’m optimistic and see the best in others, and sometimes that may strike you as naive or unrealistic when I’m convinced a tough situation can be fixed with greater effort versus a structural change.</li></ul><h4><strong>What gains and loses my trust</strong></h4><ul><li>The easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback — whether about a piece of design work, a project proposal, or their own behavior — and use it to improve. Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.</li><li>Another thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.</li><li>I appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.</li><li>I build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.</li><li>If you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.</li><li>If I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.</li><li>It’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.</li></ul><h4><strong>My strengths</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Strong relationships</strong>. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.</li><li><strong>Staying calm, collected, and optimistic</strong>. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong>. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.</li><li><strong>Thoughtful intentionality</strong>: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.</li></ul><h4><strong>My growth areas</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Directness and simplicity in communication</strong>: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.</li><li><strong>Execution/follow-through</strong>: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.</li><li><strong>Meta-prioritization</strong>: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.</li><li><strong>Expanding domains of knowledge</strong>: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.</li><li><strong>Storytelling</strong>: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.</li></ul><p><em>Image by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/miemo/\"><em>Miemo Penttinen</em></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b8ee547a79e9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","content:encodedSnippet":"What makes you tick?

Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.\nAnother thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.\nI appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.\nI build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.\nIf you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.\nIf I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.\nIt’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.\n\nMy strengths\n\nStrong relationships. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.\nStaying calm, collected, and optimistic. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.\nLong-term focus. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.\nThoughtful intentionality: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.\n\nMy growth areas\n\nDirectness and simplicity in communication: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.\nExecution/follow-through: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.\nMeta-prioritization: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.\nExpanding domains of knowledge: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.\nStorytelling: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.\n\nImage by Miemo Penttinen","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/b8ee547a79e9","isoDate":"2020-08-07T14:30:36.000Z"},{"creator":"Julie Zhuo","title":"Seven Reminders about Racism","link":"https://joulee.medium.com/seven-reminders-about-racism-b1b3e20d018?source=rss-b8a4e5ae7490------2","pubDate":"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 14:30:43 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person.

We’ve been socialized to think of “those racists” as morally horrible, so we want to avoid being labelled <em>racist</em> at any cost. But this cost is astronomically high: we’ve been living under a veil of ignorance that whispers: <em>“Good” people (such as ourselves!) are not racists</em>. Therefore, we don’t talk about racism. We don’t talk about racism <em>so much</em> that it feels uncomfortable to bring up race up at all. But you can’t fix a problem if you don’t talk about it.</li><li>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person. It means you’ve said or done things that perpetuate systems benefitting certain races — <em>your race</em> — at the expense of others. Instead of hearing <em>You said something racist</em> as <em>You just called me a shitty person</em>, we need to retrain ourselves to hear it as we would any other useful criticism — <em>Your statement had a negative impact on X person or group</em>. If you’re embarrassed about having that kind of negative impact, great! It means you care to do better (and are not a morally horrible person. )</li><li>The vast majority of conflicts are two-way streets, where each side can easily point out something the other side did that “wasn’t right.” For example, Person A calls Person B out for saying something racist, and Person B calls out Person A for saying it in an attacking manner. If you are Person C seeking to be a neutral mediator, you may think that both sides make reasonable points and could stand to improve by listening to the other. That seems fair, right? Well, only if Person B and Person A are in relatively equal positions of power. However, if they are not, <em>the person with greater power in the scenario holds greater responsibility to resolve (rather than escalate) the conflict.</em> If tensions escalate between a manager and her report, who would you expect to stay calm and collected? If a child and their parent both say “You’re awful” in a moment of anger to one another, who do you think needs to apologize first?</li><li>People with power often don’t recognize the power they have, especially if it’s afforded by the color of their skin. We tend to think of ourselves as “normal people,” “human, just like everyone else.” This is not wrong. None of us are exempt from joy, suffering, pain, fear, self-loathing, and the entire spectrum of the human condition. We all have moments when we feel trapped or suffocated by those who hold power over us. At the same time, <em>all</em> of us will be in contexts where we have more power than someone else. Some folks are in that position far more often due to the color of their skin (whiter), their gender (male), or their economic status (wealthier). Reflecting on your power is similar to the exercise of giving thanks: there is always something to be grateful for in your life (that somebody else doesn’t have); there is always something you have more power to change than somebody else.</li><li>Privilege is all the good stuff you get that others don’t because of the circumstances of your birth. Power is your ability to influence how the rules of our man-made society work. Both are hard to see in the same way that air is hard to see — you don’t notice it until there’s not enough. Black and Brown people have felt this lack for a long, long time. It started 400 years ago when they were enslaved, killed and treated as “less than” human. This lack continues today. Compared to a White or Asian person, it’s harder for them to be trusted, to be hired, to borrow money, to be believed, to be celebrated, to be in positions of power, or to be seen. We need to seek out, listen to and understand the stories of groups with less power and privilege to truly appreciate what we do have, and how we can apply that towards a more just society.</li><li>When someone calls you out for saying or doing something racist, your response can be very simple: 1) thank them for bringing it to your attention 2) apologize for the hurt you caused 3) commit to reflecting and improving. Thank them because feedback is a gift that will make your future self better. Apologize because you choose to believe people when they tell you they are hurt. Apologize even if your intentions were good, because good intentions don’t negate the negative impact of your actions. (You still say <em>Sorry</em> when you accidentally bump into someone, don’t you?) Reflect and strive for better because even if you don’t think you did anything wrong in that moment, you will likely find lessons to take away upon further processing. If you have feedback about how the other person’s message could have been better delivered, now’s not the time to share because it’s probably coming from a place of defensiveness. Save it for when you’ve built trust with that person and can share it with <em>their</em> best intentions in mind.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to acknowledge, talk about, and act on race and racism. You will make mistakes and say the wrong things. But that’s true for anything worthwhile in life. At the end of the day, actions matter. What can you do with your power?

In his article, he cites research from Google that suggests <strong>psychological safety is the most predictive characteristic of successful teams</strong>. As a minority working in tech, this article brought to mind a pressing question: given the lack of diversity in tech, how can tech workers foster a psychologically-safe environment for minorities, many of whom struggle just to be their true selves at work? For me, it starts with empathy.</p><p>Have you ever spent time in a place where you’re in the minority, even briefly? At an event, for example, or in another country? Think about how you felt being the only man at an event attended primarily by women, or the only white person in an entire train station in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. If you have never experienced this, try it. <strong>The feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, is what many minorities experience in the workplace on a regular basis.</strong></p><p>Until recently in my career, I was always the only black person on my team. Coworkers have generally been nice to me, but it’s hard to ignore that I’m <em>noticeably</em> different when no one else at work looks like I do. I’ve learned to ignore this feeling of being an outsider, but it always comes back eventually, whether it’s during meetings with executive leadership, while walking into a company’s office for an onsite interview, or in other work-related situations.</p><p>Perhaps you know some minorities who don’t seem to experience that feeling, and perhaps they don’t, especially when they feel successful in their career. I know minorities who’ve reached a point where they no longer give a damn about what others think or they’ve learned to cope with the status quo.</p><blockquote><em>But many minorities spend a significant amount of cognitive energy trying to belong instead of performing our best work and it’s exhausting.</em></blockquote><p>One thing I’ve come to realize is how hard it is for people to share these experiences. Often, these stories are too personal, emotional, subjective, or hard to share without deeply trusting the listener. It is also difficult to share these stories, as without the larger context, the listener is unlikely to grasp the nuances of the experience without knowing the backstory.</p><p>In general, many minorities choose not to speak up because they don’t want to jeopardize their careers, be disliked, feel like victims, or because their opinions have been ignored in the past. Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and ‘otherness’ that they experience, it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically, true to themselves, or thrive.</p><p>Although there has been more and more discussion about the lack of diversity in tech, I believe there is still a startling empathy gap as most people do not realize the sheer amount of energy minorities expend trying to belong.

In his article, he cites research from Google that suggests psychological safety is the most predictive characteristic of successful teams. As a minority working in tech, this article brought to mind a pressing question: given the lack of diversity in tech, how can tech workers foster a psychologically-safe environment for minorities, many of whom struggle just to be their true selves at work? For me, it starts with empathy.\nHave you ever spent time in a place where you’re in the minority, even briefly? At an event, for example, or in another country? Think about how you felt being the only man at an event attended primarily by women, or the only white person in an entire train station in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. If you have never experienced this, try it. The feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, is what many minorities experience in the workplace on a regular basis.\nUntil recently in my career, I was always the only black person on my team. Coworkers have generally been nice to me, but it’s hard to ignore that I’m noticeably different when no one else at work looks like I do. I’ve learned to ignore this feeling of being an outsider, but it always comes back eventually, whether it’s during meetings with executive leadership, while walking into a company’s office for an onsite interview, or in other work-related situations.\nPerhaps you know some minorities who don’t seem to experience that feeling, and perhaps they don’t, especially when they feel successful in their career. I know minorities who’ve reached a point where they no longer give a damn about what others think or they’ve learned to cope with the status quo.\nBut many minorities spend a significant amount of cognitive energy trying to belong instead of performing our best work and it’s exhausting.\nOne thing I’ve come to realize is how hard it is for people to share these experiences. Often, these stories are too personal, emotional, subjective, or hard to share without deeply trusting the listener. It is also difficult to share these stories, as without the larger context, the listener is unlikely to grasp the nuances of the experience without knowing the backstory.\nIn general, many minorities choose not to speak up because they don’t want to jeopardize their careers, be disliked, feel like victims, or because their opinions have been ignored in the past. Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and ‘otherness’ that they experience, it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically, true to themselves, or thrive.\nAlthough there has been more and more discussion about the lack of diversity in tech, I believe there is still a startling empathy gap as most people do not realize the sheer amount of energy minorities expend trying to belong. The ideal solution is simply to have companies that are diverse, so that no one feels out of place and everyone can thrive.\nAs a first step, our white, male-dominated industry needs to recognize the real struggle that underrepresented groups face and start driving conversations and actions to create a more empathetic and inclusive workplace. Without such empathy, most companies will continue to fail to achieve true organizational buy-in and won’t be able to take the necessary actions to attract, retain, or get the best work from people who come from underrepresented backgrounds. We can all contribute to finding solutions, but many people in tech don’t bother looking for those solutions because they fail to see the problem in the first place.\n(Thanks to Dan Sherizen and Leah Reich for reviewing earlier drafts)\n\nDiversity in Tech: The Unspoken Empathy Gap was originally published in Tech Diversity Files on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Jules Walter","guid":"https://medium.com/p/5b806c83d717","categories":["silicon-valley","diversity","tech"],"isoDate":"2016-06-06T16:25:38.000Z"},{"creator":"Jules Walter","title":"Teaching Coding Skills in Developing Countries","link":"https://medium.com/the-re-education/teaching-coding-skills-in-developing-countries-dc1df479257d?source=rss-eec997506378------2","pubDate":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 02:25:57 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>What I Learned Leading a Programming Bootcamp in Haiti</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WgkYM5R-BNe0mdV_7eskBQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Teacher (center) and students in the class</figcaption></figure><p>This spring I enrolled in a CodePath mobile development course.

One of the more challenging aspects of learning to code is the willingness to put in the hours it takes to attain proficiency.
