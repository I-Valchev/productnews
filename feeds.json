succeed in all challenges in learning different things. AI technology in education develops your learning method properly. It supports teachers or coaches to implement better, acquainted, and customized help to students.</p><p>AI-powered learning techniques help teachers to examine the grasping power of learners. It differs from one student to another. Students learn the theory at varied rates. The knowledge and reasoning capabilities of each student are different.</p><p>Artificial intelligence-based education apps are fulfilling an essential role in developing the process of education and preparation methods. AI in education benefits students obtaining the course materials and listening to the subject demo anytime from anywhere. Thanks to the latest AI technology, we can do everything at our fingertips.</p><p>Here are the advantages of AI in the Education Sector:</p><h3>Lessening Workload for Educators and Learners</h3><p>One of the significant benefits of choosing artificial intelligence consulting help is that the AI-powered methods and processes can decrease the workload for educators and give them enough time to concentrate on making learning better. We have previously explained how automating organizational businesses can lower down the activity of the office team. The same approach is implemented to students as well. Students can build programs that allow them to operate at their pace.</p><p>They don’t demand to feel overwhelmed about creating various tasks for the corresponding day. It enables everyone connected to move efficiently and give their best chance. The necessity to get at the same speed as other scholars was also excluded. It provides students more courage to learn even those subjects they are ordinarily frightened of.</p><h3>Any Students Can Learn Globally</h3><p>Online programs have made it possible for students from any country to attend the course from any other nation. The physical boundaries between nations are no longer there in terms of online education. Technology made it likely to obtain functional abilities from the best teachers, no circumstance where they are placed.</p><p>Presently, students have even better possibilities of renewing their abilities into AI-powered coaching sittings. Information Technology is one area where various fields are utilizing AI. That shouldn’t be shocking since artificial intelligence is an inherent part of the industry. Students and professionals who wish to become AI and ML specialists are registering in these programs.</p><h3>Creating Good Content</h3><p>Good content is a trendy topic in the education industry. It is nothing but generating virtual content by digitizing notes, textbooks, producing video education and addresses, explaining interactive coaching sessions, and more. Artificial intelligence in education benefits plans with customizable interfaces for the students to learn quickly and experience better.

AI technology in education develops your learning method properly. It supports teachers or coaches to implement better, acquainted, and customized help to students.\nAI-powered learning techniques help teachers to examine the grasping power of learners. It differs from one student to another. Students learn the theory at varied rates. The knowledge and reasoning capabilities of each student are different.\nArtificial intelligence-based education apps are fulfilling an essential role in developing the process of education and preparation methods. AI in education benefits students obtaining the course materials and listening to the subject demo anytime from anywhere. Thanks to the latest AI technology, we can do everything at our fingertips.\nHere are the advantages of AI in the Education Sector:\nLessening Workload for Educators and Learners\nOne of the significant benefits of choosing artificial intelligence consulting help is that the AI-powered methods and processes can decrease the workload for educators and give them enough time to concentrate on making learning better. We have previously explained how automating organizational businesses can lower down the activity of the office team. The same approach is implemented to students as well. Students can build programs that allow them to operate at their pace.\nThey don’t demand to feel overwhelmed about creating various tasks for the corresponding day. It enables everyone connected to move efficiently and give their best chance. The necessity to get at the same speed as other scholars was also excluded. It provides students more courage to learn even those subjects they are ordinarily frightened of.\nAny Students Can Learn Globally\nOnline programs have made it possible for students from any country to attend the course from any other nation. The physical boundaries between nations are no longer there in terms of online education. Technology made it likely to obtain functional abilities from the best teachers, no circumstance where they are placed.\nPresently, students have even better possibilities of renewing their abilities into AI-powered coaching sittings. Information Technology is one area where various fields are utilizing AI. That shouldn’t be shocking since artificial intelligence is an inherent part of the industry. Students and professionals who wish to become AI and ML specialists are registering in these programs.\nCreating Good Content\nGood content is a trendy topic in the education industry. It is nothing but generating virtual content by digitizing notes, textbooks, producing video education and addresses, explaining interactive coaching sessions, and more. Artificial intelligence in education benefits plans with customizable interfaces for the students to learn quickly and experience better. Be it the basic level or the high level; good content can be generated for any material and any class.\nMicrolearning and experience mapping are ideas that apply to this section. Professions mapping is the method of building a visual description of the facilities required by students to do well in their education.\nAutomating Regulatory Duties\nIs there an institution that can work without backend work by the executive committee and the education department? Whether it is listing paperwork, forwarding emails and information, reaching learners and their progenitors, or obtaining reports, the official staff continually manages every day.\nFurthermore, the professors and educators have to check the homework, test essays, find a teaching plan, plan for the following sessions, etc. The remaining time is given to identifying test sheets, preparing scheduled lessons, and making the regulatory effort.

Are we just as frequently stopping to celebrate things that are going well? We all love receiving gratitude, why aren’t we expressing it often enough?</p><p>The recognition culture is precisely about avoiding the pitfall of:</p><blockquote>“No matter how hard you work you never hear a good word from anybody. But make one mistake and there’s always somebody jumping all over you!”</blockquote><p>I first learned about Kudos in Jurgen Appelo’s book on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=asc_df_0321712471/?tag=googshopes-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=54563705115&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9690774498925737917&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1005424&amp;hvtargid=pla-79018669046&amp;psc=1\">Management 3.0</a>. I have the version with pictures called “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/-/pt/dp/1119268680/ref=pd_sbs_1/258-8280429-5165733?pd_rd_w=Q3kSE&amp;pf_rd_p=c289ec33-e7ac-4087-b63e-bf352f1cf145&amp;pf_rd_r=2AB3B9BDHT74BAMWMVW3&amp;pd_rd_r=0ac6a8ea-0630-47e1-b23e-d532b2b7a8ce&amp;pd_rd_wg=vglyT&amp;pd_rd_i=1119268680&amp;psc=1\">Managing for Happiness</a>”. If you haven’t heard about it, I highly recommend getting yourself a copy. If you ever thought about becoming a manager, it is a must-read. It gamifies the experience and is fun to read and practice. I explain more about Management 3.0 and leadership best practices in my article “<a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum/leadership-is-not-a-role-it-is-a-relationship-4d581b07dc68\">Leadership Is Not A Role, It Is A Relationship</a>”.</p><h3><strong>Extrinsic and Intrinsic motivation</strong></h3><p>Kudos are described in the first chapter of the book. The subtitle goes “Motivate people with better rewards”. First, let’s explain the two different kinds of motivation to understand why it is important.</p><p><strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong> is fuelled by external rewards like money, grades, or praise, e.g. the employee of the month. The common pitfall here is that the incentives make people stop doing their tasks just for the joy of well-done work and start looking for rewards. And rewards based on outcomes increase the risk of cheating. People will find any shortcut to get the bonus and in the process, they may lose the enjoyment of work.</p><p>Just think about all those bankers in the US in 2008 who gave out mortgages to their customers like candies just to get their cut. Here’s how a badly thought bonus scheme can drown not only a company but whole countries! <br>Of course, we are talking about knowledge work, in environments based on highly repetitive work, the rewards help keep you going. However, they need to be adjusted from time to time because after some time they may stop working.</p><p><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> is different, here the behavior is triggered from within a person according to their values and judgments. It is where longevity and true engagement will come from.</p><h3><strong>What are Kudos and what do they have to do with intrinsic motivation?</strong></h3><p>Kudo cards are small tokens employees give each other when they want to express gratitude. I am used to using the template Jurgen Appelo has on his <a href=\"https://management30.com/practice/kudo-cards/\">management 3.0 website</a> but you can use anything, even send a short message on Slack.</p><figure><img alt=\"Kudos cards template\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m7zVHjjoAJBEqpWQXgzz1A.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Kudos template as per Management 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>In the old-normality, we would install a Kudo box in the cafeteria of our office. We would ask the employees to recognize each other’s behavior by leaving Kudos Cards in the box. Then on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, during informal company gatherings like breakfasts, we would read the cards aloud. After each readout, the person who received a Kudo would come and pick up their card. As per public recognition, remember? This way we were able to create our Kudos collections on our desk.</p><p>In the remote reality, where many of us will stay for a little longer or forever, you can create a Kudos channel on Slack or Teams. And you can use the online tool I like to use <a href=\"https://kudobox.co/\">kudobox.co</a> to write digital kudos. Once the card is written you can download it or take a screenshot and post it on the channel tagging the person you wish to express gratitude to. In my company the Kudos come on a daily basis.</p><p>When we receive thanks from another colleague in the form of Kudos it usually is unexpected and a sincere way to give thanks. Recognition and public praise elevate our social status. And this stimulates serotonin in the brain. That’s why we feel so good when we are praised. Giving Kudos is a way of recognizing each other. Not just top to bottom but between peers. It is harder to cheat the system when rewards are not scheduled, anticipated, or promised in advance. Plus, having a community that enjoys their interactions helps to keep their engagement and loyalty.</p><p>Elevating social status may seem like an external motivation and to a certain extent, it is. However, status can be a very personal treat. Feeling that others value your input, experience, and willingness to help can go hand in hand with our internal values.</p><h3><strong>Six traits for positive rewards</strong></h3><p>Appelo lists six traits of positive rewards, which also explains why giving Kudos is a great way to stimulate intrinsic motivation:</p><ol><li><strong>Don’t promise rewards in advance</strong> — yearly bonus, an employee of the month, those are anticipated rewards, research shows however that when acknowledgment of work comes as a surprise, intrinsic motivation will not be undermined — Kudos are unexpected.</li><li><strong>Keep anticipated rewards small</strong> — there are a lot of stories about Hackathons at work going awry because a big prize was set. When people focus on the reward instead of a great idea to work on, then their creativity can be hindered and instead of being innovative they will focus on “what the CTO will love most”. So keeping anticipated rewards small is a good idea to keep the creativity.</li><li><strong>Reward continuously not once</strong> — celebrate daily wins and key accomplishments, don’t wait for big events. You can give kudos in digital form on a daily basis by creating a Kudos Slack channel.</li><li><strong>Reward publicly, not privately</strong> — as mentioned previously, the key is to recognize in public and make clear what is being rewarded and why. It gives everyone an idea about the desired behavior according to our company culture.</li><li><strong>Reward behavior not outcome</strong> — outcomes can often be achieved through shortcuts and behavior is about hard work and effort.</li><li><strong>Reward peers, not subordinates </strong>— peers may know better than managers which colleague deserves a reward.</li></ol><h3><strong>Define recognition</strong></h3><p>A good practice I noticed in some companies is to tie the company values to recognition. Let’s imagine one of our company values is to be “Collaborative”. Then on a Kudos template, you would have those values instead of a generic “Good job!”. Typically, you’d have a little description of what “collaborative” means for your company. This can serve as a guide for people to look for certain desirable behavior in their colleagues. This way people are much better fitted to address those qualities in other people’s behavior.</p><h3><strong>What do we write?</strong></h3><p>This is the most important part for me. And for this part, I recommend you watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l7TONauJGfc\">Marshall Rosenberg’s training in Nonviolent Communication</a>. He explains like no one else why saying “Great job!” or “You’re brilliant!” really means nothing. What was the behavior we would like to keep and have more of? We need to name it.</p><p>When expressing gratitude we want to let the other person know specifically what they did that made life more wonderful for us. Not just give some vague generality like “Nice work!”</p><p>Marshall’s proposition is to explain how someone’s behavior has helped us or had a positive effect on us, the product, or the company.</p><ol><li><strong>Describe a concrete action</strong> — bring to other people’s attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. Avoid vague generalizations. E.g. “You offered to help me with the presentation.”</li><li><strong>How did it make you feel </strong>— “I felt relieved when you offered to help”; “I felt energized after the warm-up before the training.”</li><li><strong>What need of yours has been met</strong> —” I felt relieved when you offered to help because I felt very lost. I didn’t know how to start this presentation and needed some direction.”</li></ol><h3><strong>Receiving gratitude</strong></h3><p>The truth is we are somewhat uncomfortable with giving and receiving. Marshall Rosenberg says we are used to receiving gratitude in two polar ways. Both coming from egotism:</p><ol><li><strong>Feeling superior</strong> because we<em> deserved</em> this gratitude.</li><li><strong>Shrugging it off</strong> — saying “That’s nothing”; “De nada”; “Nie ma za co” — we have that expression in many languages. Rosenberg calls it “false humility” as it denies the importance of appreciation.</li></ol><p>Why not receive gratitude joyfully? Why not say, “I’m happy to have helped!” or even “Anytime!”. To do that we need to stop fearing getting thanks.</p><p>I really like the following lines from a book by Marianne Williamson:</p><blockquote>“Playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.”</blockquote><blockquote>“When we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.</blockquote><p>A culture of recognition can be trained. And we can do it in our own way, so it best fits us and our company culture, this way it doesn’t feel fake or forced. As Scrum Masters, it is part of our role to foster a feedback culture, where inspection and adaptation don’t just happen on a special occasion but become a part of our everyday work. Hope this article will inspire you to foster the celebration of small and big wins on a daily basis!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/969/0*nr9BOeBQxskaENDy.png\" /><figcaption><a href=\"http://seriousscrum.com/invite\">Do you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?</a></figcaption></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9e00cc6f4fcb\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum/kudos-and-public-recognition-in-the-office-and-in-remote-9e00cc6f4fcb\">Kudos And Public Recognition In The Office And In Remote</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/serious-scrum\">Serious Scrum</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"REMOTE WORK\nHow to foster a recognition culture while in remote\nKudos & Recognition Culture in Remote Video Cover\nA good rule of thumb for giving feedback is to praise in public and criticize in private.

We need to name it.\nWhen expressing gratitude we want to let the other person know specifically what they did that made life more wonderful for us. Not just give some vague generality like “Nice work!”\nMarshall’s proposition is to explain how someone’s behavior has helped us or had a positive effect on us, the product, or the company.\n\nDescribe a concrete action — bring to other people’s attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. Avoid vague generalizations. E.g. “You offered to help me with the presentation.”\nHow did it make you feel — “I felt relieved when you offered to help”; “I felt energized after the warm-up before the training.”\nWhat need of yours has been met —” I felt relieved when you offered to help because I felt very lost. I didn’t know how to start this presentation and needed some direction.”\n\nReceiving gratitude\nThe truth is we are somewhat uncomfortable with giving and receiving. Marshall Rosenberg says we are used to receiving gratitude in two polar ways. Both coming from egotism:\n\nFeeling superior because we deserved this gratitude.\nShrugging it off — saying “That’s nothing”; “De nada”; “Nie ma za co” — we have that expression in many languages. Rosenberg calls it “false humility” as it denies the importance of appreciation.\n\nWhy not receive gratitude joyfully? Why not say, “I’m happy to have helped!” or even “Anytime!”. To do that we need to stop fearing getting thanks.\nI really like the following lines from a book by Marianne Williamson:\n“Playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.”\n“When we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.\nA culture of recognition can be trained. And we can do it in our own way, so it best fits us and our company culture, this way it doesn’t feel fake or forced. As Scrum Masters, it is part of our role to foster a feedback culture, where inspection and adaptation don’t just happen on a special occasion but become a part of our everyday work. Hope this article will inspire you to foster the celebration of small and big wins on a daily basis!\nDo you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?\nKudos And Public Recognition In The Office And In Remote was originally published in Serious Scrum on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Maria Chec","guid":"https://medium.com/p/9e00cc6f4fcb","categories":["serious-scrum","kudos","scrum","management30","scrum-master"],"isoDate":"2021-05-26T09:59:06.000Z"},{"creator":"Lauren Kay","title":"Why You Need a Writer Website — and How to Build One in 15 Minutes","link":"https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-need-a-writer-website-and-how-to-build-one-in-15-minutes-865af54fa35d?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4","pubDate":"Wed, 26 May 2021 09:47:27 GMT","dc:creator":"Lauren Kay","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-need-a-writer-website-and-how-to-build-one-in-15-minutes-865af54fa35d?source=rss----f5af2b715248---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1536/1*3gjMqCbqtts3WYjFjC0dQw.png\" width=\"1536\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">Never underestimate the value of having your own website.

Choose Scrum for the Right Purpose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Strive for High Product Quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/technical-debt-scrum/\" title=\"Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible? Age-of-Product.com \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Technical Debt &#038; Scrum: Who Is Responsible</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Garbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/28-product-backlog-anti-patterns/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns - Age-of-Product.com\" target=\"_blank\">28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns</a>.) </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Embrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Restrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In none of these four areas, a Scrum Master can advance the cause without the deliberate and voluntary support of other people. This is a great challenge many successful Scrum Masters love to address. Unfortunately, however, not all of us are so fortunate to work under these conditions. The frustrated Scrum Master symptom is real; not every Scrum Master who performs below expectations does so because of a lack of competence. Sometimes, former missionaries turn into mercenaries when they see no use to continue fighting inertia, politics, or conflicting agendas. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Possible Reasons Why Missionaries Become a Frustrated Scrum Master</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reasons why able and willing Scrum Masters abandon the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. Probably, the Scrum Master has been working his or her butt off for months, but neither the Scrum Team nor the organization is responding to the effort. There are many potential reasons for a failure at this level, to name a few:</p> \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The lack of sponsoring from the C-level of the organization</li> \r\n\t<li>A widespread belief that &#8216;Agile&#8217; is just the latest management fad, and thus ignorable </li>\r\n\t<li>The company culture values neither transparency nor radical candor</li>\r\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/scrum-failure-culture-making-your-scrum-work-10\" title=\"Why Scrum Requires a Failure Culture — Making Your Scrum Work #10\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">company has no failure culture</a>; consequently, everyone plays safe, resulting in short-term orientation as not-failing is more important than innovation </li>\r\n\t<li>The Scrum Team composition is wrong</li>\r\n\t<li>Members of the Scrum Team object self-management</li>\r\n\t<li>There is no psychological safety to address the Scrum Team&#8217;s problems </li>\r\n\t<li>Individual team members harbor personal agendas unaligned with the team&#8217;s objective. </li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These examples can lead an able and willing Scrum Master off the path, resulting in a frustrated Scrum Master either considering leaving for a more supportive environment or turning into a mercenary, trading time for a paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/frustrated-scrum-master/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnwKgNCs7G9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Frustrated Scrum Master — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous reasons why a Scrum Master may leave the path and become a frustrated Scrum Master or even a mercenary. However, before you jump to conclusions, try and understand the context of the development. Probably, it does not have anything to do with competence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is your organization failing to support its Scrum Masters, thus advancing the problem of the frustrated Scrum Master?

Choose Scrum for the Right Purpose\n\r\n\r\nChoosing the appropriate application area for Scrum is essential. Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n2. Strive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n3. Create and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n4. Embrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\nIn none of these four areas, a Scrum Master can advance the cause without the deliberate and voluntary support of other people. This is a great challenge many successful Scrum Masters love to address. Unfortunately, however, not all of us are so fortunate to work under these conditions. The frustrated Scrum Master symptom is real; not every Scrum Master who performs below expectations does so because of a lack of competence. Sometimes, former missionaries turn into mercenaries when they see no use to continue fighting inertia, politics, or conflicting agendas. \n\r\n\r\nPossible Reasons Why Missionaries Become a Frustrated Scrum Master\n\r\n\r\nThe reasons why able and willing Scrum Masters abandon the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. Probably, the Scrum Master has been working his or her butt off for months, but neither the Scrum Team nor the organization is responding to the effort. There are many potential reasons for a failure at this level, to name a few:\n \r\n\r\n\t\nThe lack of sponsoring from the C-level of the organization\n \r\n\t\nA widespread belief that ‘Agile’ is just the latest management fad, and thus ignorable \n\r\n\t\nThe company culture values neither transparency nor radical candor\n\r\n\t\nThe company has no failure culture; consequently, everyone plays safe, resulting in short-term orientation as not-failing is more important than innovation \n\r\n\t\nThe Scrum Team composition is wrong\n\r\n\t\nMembers of the Scrum Team object self-management\n\r\n\t\nThere is no psychological safety to address the Scrum Team’s problems \n\r\n\t\nIndividual team members harbor personal agendas unaligned with the team’s objective. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese examples can lead an able and willing Scrum Master off the path, resulting in a frustrated Scrum Master either considering leaving for a more supportive environment or turning into a mercenary, trading time for a paycheck.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Frustrated Scrum Master — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons why a Scrum Master may leave the path and become a frustrated Scrum Master or even a mercenary. However, before you jump to conclusions, try and understand the context of the development. Probably, it does not have anything to do with competence.\n\r\n\r\nHow is your organization failing to support its Scrum Masters, thus advancing the problem of the frustrated Scrum Master?

With construction of each tree we move in the direction of negative gradient of the Loss function L approaching the actual y.\nAfter the tree t is built, the tree t outputs the estimates as:\n\nFor classification, when the prediction > threshold, we declare the output to be class k. This threshold can be set by analyzing the ROC curve.\nThe residual for the next tree t is calculated as:\n\nIn this way the trees are built till the maximum no. of trees are built or the residual is below some threshold ε.\nPrediction\nFinal prediction of the boosted machine is the summation of predictions of all the trees weighed by the learning rate.\n\nFor classification the final prediction is dependent on the threshold set.\nReferences:\nI have referred to some material presented by Josh Starmer in his Gradient Boost videos.

Scroll down to “ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE” section and upload your file there, fill in alias and passwords fields.</p><p>Now, you will be able to sign your build using Bitrise. Add a new step somewhere after the “Flutter Build” and find “Android Sign” in Bitrise steps directory.

To do this you will need to fill in quite a few forms and upload app’s logo and some dummy screenshots. Don’t worry about the content at this stage, you can edit everything later, just paste some “lorem ipsum” stuff in there to complete the setup and activate the Alpha release track. <strong>This step is important to activate an ability to rollout subsequent releases via API.</strong></p><h3>Configure Developer API Access</h3><p>To upload builds using Google Play API you need to configure Developer API Access.

Hope this was helpful (clap three times in this case ;)</p><h3>Pitfalls</h3><p>In this section I’ll list errors and problems I met and had to figure out how to solve while was setting up the workflow.

Do not forget to write down somewhere the passwords you have chosen, as you will need them.\nIt’s important to know that the key that was used to sign the very first build of an application uploaded to Play market has to be used to upload updates of that application and cannot be changed in the future, so do not lose it, otherwise you will not be able to upload new versions.\nOnce the key store is generated, open Bitrise Application and navigate to Workflow Editor → Code Signing tab. Scroll down to “ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE” section and upload your file there, fill in alias and passwords fields.\nNow, you will be able to sign your build using Bitrise. Add a new step somewhere after the “Flutter Build” and find “Android Sign” in Bitrise steps directory. To find it you will need to switch the filter on the right side to “all”\n\nYou don’t need to change anything, default values work for us. Try to run your workflow and see if Build phase passes successfully.\nUpload first signed build to Play Market\nBefore you can upload builds via Google Play API you should upload an initial build manually, to initialize newly created app.\nAfter the lates build has completed, open it’s “APPS & ARTIFACTS” section, find and download your signed *-signed.aab file in there.\n\nThen, go to Google Play Console, navigate to your app’s Releases-Closed testing sub-section, create, setup and rollout your first release for your internal testers. To do this you will need to fill in quite a few forms and upload app’s logo and some dummy screenshots. Don’t worry about the content at this stage, you can edit everything later, just paste some “lorem ipsum” stuff in there to complete the setup and activate the Alpha release track. This step is important to activate an ability to rollout subsequent releases via API.\nConfigure Developer API Access\nTo upload builds using Google Play API you need to configure Developer API Access. Navigate to Google Play Console → Settings → API Access and link your Google Cloud project, either existing or create a new one like I did.\n\nafter a project is linked, create a new Service Account, the process is pretty straightforward, do not skip the permissions step and grant your Service Account an access to your Google Play Console.\n\nAfter the Service Account is created, go to it’s Keys section, generate and download a new key\n\nAfter it’s done, you will be navigated back to Play Console API access settings page and after the list of service accounts refreshed you will see the created account in it. Click Grant access and it’s done.\n\nConfigure the final step, uploading\nGo back to your Bitrise App’s workflow, add a new step after “Android Sign” and find “Google Play Deploy” step in the list.\n\nThe only thing to configure in this step are our app’s “Package Name” (aka Bundle ID) and “Track”, which can be set to any track you want for your pipeline (e.g. alpha, beta, release etc). I used “internal” track for my dev builds.\nThat’s it, folks! Hope this was helpful (clap three times in this case ;)\nPitfalls\nIn this section I’ll list errors and problems I met and had to figure out how to solve while was setting up the workflow. Just to help someone who might be looking for a solution in the future.\n“java.io.ioexception: Invalid keystore format”\nIn my case I first generated the keystore using Oracle Java v16, and it’s not compatible with openJDK that bitrise is using, I solved the problem by generating the key store using Android Studio UI.\nFailed to validate edit, error: googleapi: Error 400: Only releases with status draft may be created on draft app.\nyou can’t push your uploaded build into any Release track when your app is in Draft state. To solve this — configure and roll out the Alpha track manually.\nResources\nhttps://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android\nhttps://medium.com/bewizyu/part-1-how-to-setup-a-flutter-application-with-bitrise-346dba7d1bab\nhttps://blog.bitrise.io/how-to-deploy-android-app-to-google-play-store\nhttps://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started\nhttps://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/generating-and-deploying-android-app-bundles/\n\nBuild a Flutter Android app and deploy it to Google Play  using Bitrise CI/CD platform was originally published in Geek Culture on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Igor Kurochka","guid":"https://medium.com/p/68de0612ede","categories":["automation","flutter","android","bitrise","ci-cd-pipeline"],"isoDate":"2021-05-26T08:25:06.000Z"},{"creator":"Arnold Abraham","title":"Your Guide for One of TypeScript’s Most Useful Concepts","link":"https://medium.com/geekculture/your-guide-for-one-of-typescripts-most-useful-concepts-8e62b92d1d93?source=rss----9758482ba857---4","pubDate":"Wed, 26 May 2021 08:24:54 GMT","dc:creator":"Arnold Abraham","content":"<div class=\"medium-feed-item\"><p class=\"medium-feed-image\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture/your-guide-for-one-of-typescripts-most-useful-concepts-8e62b92d1d93?source=rss----9758482ba857---4\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*mzyehgOA8W5SgZJnbtTxuw.png\" width=\"1000\"></a></p><p class=\"medium-feed-snippet\">Generics 101 of TypeScript</p><p class=\"medium-feed-link\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture/your-guide-for-one-of-typescripts-most-useful-concepts-8e62b92d1d93?source=rss----9758482ba857---4\">Continue reading on Geek Culture »</a></p></div>","contentSnippet":"Generics 101 of TypeScript\nContinue reading on Geek Culture »","guid":"https://medium.com/p/8e62b92d1d93","categories":["front-end-development","typescript","software-development","javascript","guides-and-tutorials"],"isoDate":"2021-05-26T08:24:54.000Z"},{"creator":"Programmer101N","title":"Create bot for your Discord Server","link":"https://medium.com/geekculture/create-bot-for-your-discord-server-59989b39f6fa?source=rss----9758482ba857---4","pubDate":"Wed, 26 May 2021 08:24:36 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>In this blog, We will create bot for your discord server which can perform variety of commands.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0q4YrfG8DKU4Dbuj.png\" /></figure><h4>What we need for this tutorial</h4><ul><li>NodeJs and NPM installed</li><li>discord.js</li><li>dotenv</li></ul><h4>Setting up project</h4><p>Create a folder named discord_bot and initialize a node project in that folder with npm init -y command.

Then that server responds with a resource such as images, videos, or HTML web page, which your browser going to displays for you. So, this is the simplest way to answer that question. However, we all know there are lot more happening on the underline. But in this article, we are going to learn about one of the main components of this process, HTTP protocol.</p><h3>What is HTTP?</h3><p>The HTTP acronym stands for <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong>. HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web (WWW) to exchange information, that found on web pages. When accessing any web page entering “<strong>http://”</strong> in front of the address tells the web browser to communicate over HTTP. For example, the URL for Google is https://www.google.com. But if you notice, today’s browsers no longer require HTTP in front of the URL since it is the default method of communication.

So basically, the only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP.

The request provides the server with the desired information it needs to adjust its response to the client device. There are several HTTP request methods known as <strong>Get, Post, Delete, Put, and Head</strong>.

Software applications like web browsers and email clients depend on the application layer to initiate communications. To make things clear, that client software applications are not part of the application layer.

The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called “<strong>packets</strong>.” So, on the sender’s device, these packets reassembled on the receiving device.

This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a <strong>bit stream, </strong>which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.</p><p>So, this is the end of the article and I hope you enjoyed it.

Then that server responds with a resource such as images, videos, or HTML web page, which your browser going to displays for you. So, this is the simplest way to answer that question. However, we all know there are lot more happening on the underline. But in this article, we are going to learn about one of the main components of this process, HTTP protocol.\nWhat is HTTP?\nThe HTTP acronym stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web (WWW) to exchange information, that found on web pages. When accessing any web page entering “http://” in front of the address tells the web browser to communicate over HTTP. For example, the URL for Google is https://www.google.com. But if you notice, today’s browsers no longer require HTTP in front of the URL since it is the default method of communication. However, it is kept in browsers because of the need to separate protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).\nOther notable protocols are:\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP): is a standard protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network.\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): is a standard for email transmission.\nHTTP is defined as a stateless, “client-server” protocol or “request-response” protocol. Stateless means that all requests are separate from each other. So, every request from your browser must contain enough information on its own for the server to fulfill the request. That means each request is executed without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it or after it.\nThe client-server protocol describes the communication between two computers. The client (browser or another application) requests data and the server provide a response. So, this is how we can go to a website and see information on that website. With HTTP protocol, the client request always happens first and is followed by the server’s response.\nImage: How HTTP Works (https://whatis.techtarget.com/)\nHTTP vs. HTTPS\nThe S in HTTPS is stands for “secure.” HTTPS uses TLS or SSL to encrypt HTTP requests and responses.

Product Leader</h3><p>This is Part 1 of the “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@James_Wang-Product/becoming-a-product-leader-introduction-3410931eb7ce\">Becoming a Product Leader</a>” series. In this series, I’m tackling different outcomes and traits that individual contributor Product Managers can practice and cultivate to become a Product Leader. This article focuses on shifting one’s perspective from a team level Product Manager to an organization wide Product Leader.</p><p>The biggest obstacle I faced when trying to move from Product Manager to Product Leader was my own mindset. I had a number of attitudes and beliefs that were counterproductive and held me back:</p><ul><li>Leadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.</li><li>How am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.</li><li>I can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.</li></ul><p>You may or may not suffer from any of these misconceptions. But I’ve seen other experienced individual contributors making the same mistakes, banging their heads against the ceiling of management and leadership.</p><p>Changing my perspective was difficult and is an ongoing struggle. But pushing myself to a new mindset has made all the difference in my ability to be a leader.</p><blockquote>Leadership is responsible for solving organizational problems and strategy. I’ll take on these kinds of initiatives when it’s my job to do so, or if it means I’ll get promoted.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OSsjJuFf0YLqAUofDApYZw.png\" /></figure><h3>Don’t Wait to Be Invited</h3><p>People can hold themselves back by thinking it’s not their place to take on organizational initiatives. Whether they think it’s not their responsibility or not in their authority, they can find reasons not to try to tackle large problems.</p><p>For a while, I had a pretty rigid hierarchical view of how organizations worked. I believed that each role had a specific area of responsibility and authority, and operating outside of those bounds wasn’t appropriate. So when I saw problems in organization wide strategy or gaps in major processes, I’d complain to my manager or leadership.</p><p>And I got frustrated, because the problems would generally persist, and it felt like nothing that I said mattered.</p><p>More than anything, my beliefs about having the <em>authority</em> to drive large initiatives was holding me back. I had no problems driving changes for my team or even working with my peers to make small changes in our process. But larger, organizational changes felt outside of the authority of a simple team-level Product Manager.</p><p>Talking to my manager and other leaders helped me to challenge this thinking. Yes, there were some decisions that would be difficult to involve myself in. But there were countless other initiatives and problems that needed driving that any individual could take on.</p><p>And there wasn’t any magical authority that came with moving up to a higher level that suddenly changed how things needed to get done. I wanted to be in a position where people would have to listen to me. But being a great leader isn’t about relying on your title to ram changes through; it’s about building trust through effective collaboration and swaying hearts and minds to align on goals and a direction.</p><p>It was obvious in hindsight, but it was helpful having someone point it out to me: I didn’t need the title to do the work.</p><p>But why should I take on all this extra work if I couldn’t be certain it would mean a promotion?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TuPGcKTA2DNhEYGZkiu_8w.png\" /></figure><h3>Don’t Look For Guarantees</h3><p>Moving into a leadership position can require taking on a number of responsibilities above and beyond your day to day role. And few people embrace the idea of doing extra work without some kind of compensation and recognition. I often looked at it from a transactional perspective: if I did this work, was I going to get promoted? How many features did I need to launch? How many initiatives did I need to drive? How many people did I need to mentor?</p><p>It usually doesn’t work like that. Your manager and senior leaders won’t make such promises, because 1) these roles are filled based on business needs, and 2) just because you checked some boxes doesn’t mean you&#39;ve proven you can thrive in the new position.</p><p>People need to trust that you have the attitude, aptitude, and capacity to be great at the next level. They need to believe that they should continue to invest in you. There are a lot qualities that your leadership team is looking for. Many of which they won’t or don’t know how to articulate. Doing the work provides an opportunity for you to actually discover, practice, and demonstrate those qualities.</p><p>And if you really want to be in the role, you should want to do the work. If your only interest in taking on a complex cross-organizational initiative is to have the title, then you’re going about this backwards. Moving into the role makes those kinds of challenges your job. If you don’t enjoy mentoring and coaching other PMs, why do you want to be a manager? If you don’t embrace the value and impact of driving alignment with multiple leaders, why do you want to make that your day to day responsibility?</p><p>If you want to do the work, you should do the work.</p><blockquote>How am I supposed to drive these initiatives as an IC? There’s so much uncertainty and I don’t have the authority to change things.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zY9m8k8qs4Y17q2VTUqq2g.png\" /></figure><h3>Embrace the Uncertainty</h3><p>The initiatives and problems you drive as a Product Leader are much more complex, much less certain. Building confidence and alignment across an organization in the face of such uncertainty is difficult. But it’s all the more important because of that uncertainty.</p><p>When taking on larger initiatives — whether new product discovery, a major operational shift, or a change in strategy — there is not going to be an obvious right answer. You may never know the correct answer. No one will. But a plan needs to be made, and the job is creating and selling it in a way that folks will believe in it.</p><p>On larger organizational initiatives, you will rarely be able to get to the same level of confidence as you were able to reach at the team level. There are too many variables. Once you involve multiple products and multiple teams, the complexities increase exponentially. Greater dependencies between teams means reduced confidence in technical approaches and delivery dates. Making a change to your product offerings can have ripple effects on customer purchasing decisions.</p><p>Driving bigger changes means accepting you won’t have the perfect data to justify a decision. Instead, it increases the need to build confidence in that decision across an organization.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CU8EWiyjstDHq2qEZwqKdg.png\" /></figure><h4>Collaborate to Build Confidence</h4><p>Collaborating with more leaders reduces uncertainty. It increases the likelihood that a plan will succeed. And critically, it increases other people’s confidence in the plan.</p><p>As a seasoned Product Manager, you should have honed your product instincts to identify major opportunities and risks. Other leaders across your organization likewise will have built up their own instincts that you should leverage.</p><p>Their instincts and experience can help fill gaps in your knowledge or identify risks that you didn’t see. They’ll connect you with data or individuals who can answer critical questions. And they’ll help you build a stronger case to get buy in from other stakeholders and the leadership team.</p><p>Effective collaboration is the foundation for the success of any major initiative. And the bigger the initiative, the more important that collaboration is.</p><blockquote>I can’t focus on organizational initiatives, I have a responsibility first to my team.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZJSuvj6kiP05gvNXr_H5uw.png\" /></figure><h3>Prioritizing the Team and the Organization</h3><p>Leaders often have to make hard prioritization decisions that impact multiple teams. Sometimes one team’s goals has to be deprioritized in favor of a more critical organizational goal. It’s not pretty, and it can hurt morale— but it sometimes needs to be done.</p><p>Learning how to balance the needs of the organization against the needs of your immediate team can be a difficult challenge. But your job isn’t just to be a great Product Manager for your team; it’s to be a great Product Manager for your organization. As a Product Leader, you need to prioritize your time and your teams’ time wisely to ensure the highest impact for the business and your customers.</p><p>There are two key challenges here:</p><ul><li>Putting the organization’s objectives ahead of an individual team’s objectives.</li><li>Balancing your time and effort between serving the organization vs. serving the team.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yeVVdAzet8iyrUWO-gI2Bg.png\" /></figure><h4>Prioritizing the Roadmap to Serve the Organization</h4><p>There are often opportunities to support goals that don’t directly benefit your team, or slows your team down from achieving its goals. But taking these opportunities can drive better outcomes for the business, rather than if every team operated selfishly towards their own goals.</p><p>My team was working on a brand new product area, while most of the rest of the organization was working on <a href=\"https://construction.autodesk.com/\">unifying our core products</a>. Our project was new and shiny, serving the goals of exciting our customers and driving new business opportunities. By contrast, the rest of the org’s work was less glamorous, but absolutely essential to the overall success of the business.</p><p>One of the teams we were partnering with — and were heavily dependent on — was falling behind on its roadmap. This team’s product area was a foundational piece of the unified offering, and a platform on which many other teams would be developing.</p><p>We could have protected our own goals and roadmap — eating down other features in our backlog while we waited for them to catch up, or building on their platform with narrowly scoped solutions that worked only for us. Instead we collaborated with them to take on several initiatives that unblocked our team but would also serve to expand their platform for other teams.</p><p>We cost ourselves some of our velocity towards our own goals, but we accelerated adoption across the organization. And we demonstrated that we could put the good of the organization ahead of ourselves.</p><p>An important part of making this kind of decision is being highly visible. Your manager and leaders should have insight into the decision making process to ensure that this is the best course of action for the business. And your leaders should be fully aware that you’ve put the needs of the organization first.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TN9JaWFVY4k-gx2ObfL82A.png\" /></figure><h4>Prioritizing Your Time to Serve the Organization</h4><p>As a Product Manager, it can be difficult to move your focus away from the team and towards side projects. But your time is a valuable resource and prioritizing that time ruthlessly is a necessary part of being a Product Leader. Over-investing in a single team becomes a waste of your skills as you grow more seasoned and capable of impacting an organization.</p><p>I had to find my own balance in taking on side projects for the organization and doing the work for my team. As the PM on a team, you need to continue to deliver results and ensure progress and challenges are communicated up to leadership. But a lot of the invisible work that PMs do to ensure the success of the team can become unnecessary or even counterproductive. In my past, I’ve pulled a lot of teams together through grit and duct tape. I’ve been the definer, driver, and maintainer of processes that kept the team moving fast. I’ve done a lot of QA to ensure features were delivered with high quality. I’ve pulled data to make decisions on minor interactions. At a certain point, all the extra work starts to have diminishing returns.</p><p>Additionally, taking on too much responsibility can actually hamper the team’s ability to succeed. You don’t want to be the bottleneck for every minor UI decision, or not be able to trust your devs to make sure that their work meets the design and acceptance criteria. You don’t want a release to become chaos just because you were out sick. You can infantilize a team by taking away all responsibility outside of committing code. Instead, aim to find a balance that ensures the whole team is responsible for the success of the team and the product.</p><p>When my team shifted from product discovery and prototyping to production of a beta MVP, I made a decision to be less involved in the details. This meant putting the responsibility of defining and maintaining processes on the developers. I set high level expectations and provided feedback, but left it to the team to work out how they wanted to operate. This resulted in a lot more sprint iterations to find the best way forward, but it empowered the individuals to own the process and the improvements. Likewise, I tried to find a balance in the detail of my specs and in answering questions vs. ensuring everyone understood the customer problems we were trying to solve and trusting them to come up with good answers on their own.</p><p>This is an entire topic of itself, but I sought an approach of “minimum viable product management” for day to day execution. I did enough to ensure that the team and product would be successful, without chasing the last 10% of optimal product execution. It wasn’t easy to find a balance, but my team was understanding. They respected and appreciated that I was trying to drive larger improvements across the organization, and many of the devs on my team appreciated the opportunity to take more ownership.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I had to shift my perspective in a number of ways before I embodied the qualities of the kind of leader I wanted to be. And it’s still a struggle. I can fall back on bad habits and negative mindsets.

Keep in mind that behind this question is almost always a vague plan of product awareness and distribution.

Software products too frequently get created with too much user and process friction because the products aren’t being used in real life and work circumstances. If you want to create and release software products that better align with a user’s problem, workflow, and have less friction then do so in a test kitchen.</p><p>Here are some of examples of software products being created in test kitchens and why these products and companies have been successful and will likely continue to succeed:</p><h3><strong>giftHEALTH</strong></h3><p>giftHEALTH is creating a new Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) product and has recently raised a $5 million seed round. The most interesting thing about giftHEALTH to me is their decision to buy and operate a pharmacy as a test kitchen for their PBM product.</p><p>I’ve been able to get to know founder Nick Potts over the past few years and he credits their test kitchen in helping to speed up their product development, create more empathy between the product team and users, and to reduce friction in the product faster than they otherwise would be able to.</p><p>giftHEALTH’s pharmacy test kitchen has also been instrumental in helping to raise investment fairly quickly because investors are emboldened by the company’s ability to create the best product by testing and iterating on it using their own pharmacy as a test kitchen.</p><blockquote>“Having our own pharmacy gives us firsthand exposure to the pharmacy and patient experience. We have a direct feedback loop with our pharmacy for determining areas of improvement and quickly testing new innovative solutions. This sets us up for launching a refined product experience for all of our partners.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>Daniel Dalton, Director of Product at giftHEALTH</em></blockquote><h3><strong>Bevy</strong></h3><p>Bevy is a platform for organizations to facilitate and manage their communities. Bevy recently raised over $40m to continue to grow the company.</p><p>Bevy’s growth is interesting, and the team has been executing well, but what I’m most intrigued by and impressed with is how the company got started and the genesis of the product. And I have had a birds-eye of it happening, which has been fun.</p><p>Bevy’s product was unintentionally incubated through a sister organization, Startup Grind. Startup Grind is a global community that helps to inform, support, and bring together entrepreneurs through local chapters and events. Startup Grind created a product to facilitate and manage the Startup Grind community. As the Startup Grind community continued to grow and evolve the product did as well. The product was initially called the Startup Grind Dashboard. Yep, creative naming.</p><p>Turns out that as the Startup Grind Dashboard continued to evolve and become more robust to support Startup Grind’s community management needs, the Startup Grind leadership team realized the product might be able to be used by other organizations to manage their communities. They were right and now that’s Bevy.</p><p>Startup Grind served as an unintentional test kitchen for the product that eventually become the Bevy platform. Startup Grind’s community management needs facilitated the Startup Grind dashboard to get created and evolved inside of a real-world usage environment. There would be no Bevy platform and no Bevy company if it hadn’t been for Startup Grind serving as a test kitchen, even if unknowingly.</p><h3><strong>Hopewell</strong></h3><p>Hopewell is helping companies to empower their team members to do their best work by providing a re-designed work experience and environment that supports them.</p><p>Hopewell started with a physical lab in Columbus and have now opened a second one in Louisville. The physical lab helps Hopewell showcase what can be done from a physical perspective to create an environment for focused or collaborative work. The labs are also a great test kitchen for Hopewell to evaluate technologies and to gather data on work preferences and what they need to support their best work.</p><p>With the pandemic hastening the need for companies to better understand and support their team members working from anywhere also comes the need to rethink the traditional work environment. Hopewell is using its labs to expose companies to new perspectives around space and tools to foster a better team member experience.</p><p>The future of work is the present and the best way to align what people need to do their best work is to do inside of labs where different environments and tools can be tested and evolved.</p><h3><strong>SureImpact</strong></h3><p>A professional services firm wanting to have a product and to have the elusive, but highly desirable, recurring revenue is common. What isn’t common is a services firm being able to pull it off. SureImpact is a new software product company out of decade old services firm that is doing just that.</p><p>Services firms have an advantage over other companies when it comes to a test kitchen environment because the services firms that have the opportunity to productize some aspect of their process or intellectual property means they have a built-in, legacy test kitchen.</p><p>Services firms that successfully leverage their existing and past clients to become early users and advisers while creating a new product can create an early product faster and more in alignment with client needs than having to do so from scratch. Services firms can integrate the new product into their existing client relationships and workflows by demonstrating a value-add to their existing clients, while they are marketing the new product to potential new customers. With the ability to use current clients to help shape the product and get early product validation, there is little need to bring any outsiders in on the early process. This accelerates the early product creation and validation cycles. It is also much easier to iterate with existing clients that a services firm knows they can trust and rely on when collaborating on the functionality and user experience of a new product.</p><p>Products like SureImpact that are created inside of an existing services firm’s operation have many advantages that come from incubation inside the firm.</p><h3><strong>Common Test Kitchen Traits</strong></h3><p>Creating a new product in a test kitchen has several advantages and when possible, a test kitchen environment should be setup. As described above, test kitchens for new software products can take on many different forms and types but they all have these attributes in common:</p><ul><li>A test kitchen is <strong>owned </strong>by the company creating the new product. A test kitchen isn’t a focus group exercise or some arm’s length research endeavor. For a test kitchen to be effective in creating a new software product it needs to be part of the company creating the product.</li><li>A test kitchen is <strong>valued, invested, and supported </strong>as if it is crucial part of the company…because it is. A test kitchen that is a just for show, like many corporate innovation labs, aren’t really test kitchens.</li><li>A test kitchen is as close to <strong>real use</strong> as possible. For a test kitchen to provide as much insight and value as possible it has to be as real life as possible. In all the examples provided above they were and are test kitchens that work and provide value for customers or clients.</li><li>The best test kitchens can <strong>live on their own.</strong> Another thing all of the above examples have in common and good test kitchens for product creation do, is that the test kitchen can and often does operate as its own entity. Bevy now operates apart from Startup Grind. giftHEALTH’s pharmacy operates as a fully functioning pharmacy. SureImpact is able to serve clients separate from its services firm Measurement Resources. You can be a customer of Hopewell’s software product without being a member of their lab.</li></ul><p>There are key stakeholder benefits to a test kitchen as part of product development as well. Customers will value the product having been designed and developed as close to their real world as possible. This lowers the risk associated to implementing a new product. Investors, if that investment makes sense for a product and company, will be intrigued by the customer product fit established by leveraging a test kitchen to create a product. A test kitchen establishes for both customers and investors that the creators of a product understand the problem and how to solve it in practical terms.</p><p>Product creators are always looking for ways to quickly test, validate, and iterate. A test kitchen provides the platform to do so based on real operational and service’s needs. There is no better and more intimate way to understand the job to be done than to build a product to support the job to be done in real-time. More startups and corporate innovation teams creating products should give strong consideration how they can implement a test kitchen to support their product creation.</p><p>If you are in the process of, or considering, building a digital product and you need technical assistance, consider partnering with <a href=\"https://awh.net/insights/post?post=affordance-in-design\">AWH</a>.

For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to avoid complex process diagrams with decision points and flow charts. Instead, the popular double diamond framework provides us with a simple illustration of how an idea best progresses from concept to a real, working product or venture.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tju3cwSB78mjbdus.png\" /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond\">Double Diamond</a> is a process developed by the Design Council of the UK. It combines divergent thinking (exploring an issue widely) and convergent thinking to understand the problem, use these insights to define a solution, develop a solution then deliver a solution (put it into action).</p><p>Most organisations use some variation of this to work ideas from a few lines on a piece of paper to something being used by customers and earning revenue (or results).</p><p>Most of the time a new idea will need multiple iterations around this loop. For various reasons, many organisations can struggle with iterations (e.g. fear of failure, budget or governance process).</p><p>When someone is submitting ideas to a product or venture team, they’re coming in at the Discover step. You need to help them understand the problem in order to get to the next step. Most people unfamiliar with these techniques jump straight to develop mode (“I already know what we need to do, can you just build it?”).</p><h3>Why Start with Discovery?</h3><p>You need to start with a Discovery because this is <em>the</em> process for understanding the problem and the customer. It’s a way of explicitly stating your assumptions. This is the foundation that any successful venture, product or idea is built on.</p><p>If you find yourself saying “ <a href=\"https://terem.tech/when-knowing-your-customers-best-isnt-beneficial/\">I understand the customer</a> “, “I already understand the problem” or “I already know what we need” then, I can tell you now you are wrong. This comes from hard-won, expensive experience that I’ve learnt too often. The people and companies with the best understanding of their customer always say they don’t understand their customers enough, those that lack it always says they know what their customers need.</p><p>You can find a more detailed explanation of <a href=\"https://terem.tech/why-do-product-discovery/\">why Discovery is the essential foundation for any product or venture here</a>. Including a list of the benefits, risks for skipping it and false reasons people give for why it isn’t needed.</p><h3>Why Focus on The Customer and Their Problem First?</h3><p>The reason why you focus on the customer (or citizen!) and their problem first is because, at the end of the day, this is where a product succeeds or fails. You need to solve a problem.</p><p>As a non-product person, helping your product or venture team understand the customer problem is where you can add an immense amount of value, especially because you are probably closer to the customer than they are.</p><p>The focus on this, really getting this right, is far more important in the early stages of the process than market size, solutions and, even business models. If you understand the problem well, everything else can fall into place and be designed around it. If you get it wrong, then you’ll forever be trying to make up for it, often in an unnecessarily expensive way.</p><h3>What to Expect From Discovery</h3><p>When you are doing a discovery, you will likely start with the idea that you think is amazing. Then you’ll begin to explicitly stating your assumptions and interviewing customers. You are going to start learning things about the problem, about your assumptions and your customers that you had not considered.</p><p>If you’re doing it right, you will almost certainly change direction. You’ll either completely change your thinking, or you’ll make adjustments.</p><p>Follow the problem and your research, not your biases and initial assumptions.</p><p>You’ll come to the end of your discovery activities and be faced with <a href=\"https://terem.tech/end-of-discovery-decisions-what-to-do-next/\">an end of Discovery decision</a>. You’ll need to consider this before you go ahead and take it to the group that decides whether to proceed or not (it’s usually some kind of committee or executive group, but in smaller companies, it might be an individual).</p><h3>Key Concepts to Know</h3><p>There are a few concepts to consider when working through a Discovery. The list below is a refined list selected for non-product people working through the process of getting their idea up.</p><ol><li><strong>Recognise the realities of large companies</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>New ideas carry high uncertainty that large companies aren’t used to. Be aware of this and how to deal with it, don’t get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to provide certainty where it isn’t possible.</li><li>There are corporate forces that work against new products and ventures. Be aware of them, address them head-on.</li><li>Corporations get distracted by market size. It’s not always the right way to think early on with an idea.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Understand how product development is approached beyond discovery</strong> — start with the <a href=\"https://terem.tech/principles-of-product/\">principles of a product-led approach</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Focus on customers at the start of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle</strong>: Early on, you want and need to focus on customers that will be innovators. The ones that will be ok with early versions of your product, early versions that have less features because they feel the pain strongly and are willing to take some risk. Only once you are succeeding with them will you consider expanding the product to meet the needs of later adopters.</p><h3>How a Decision to Proceed Will be Made</h3><p>Finally, you want to have some understanding of how a decision will be made about whether your idea proceeds to whatever the next step in your organisation’s process is.</p><p>Most companies will have a framework or some criteria. Get this ahead of time.</p><p>Then make sure your pitch for proceeding focuses on why it’s worth proceeding to the next stage rather than why you need to Go-to-Market now. It’s easy to get diverted by solutions, market sizing and trends, but it’s usually so early in the evolution of the idea that the idea is easily rejected because it carries too many assumptions or risks.</p><p>Instead, focus on what you have with your newly gained understanding of the customer and the problem. Pitch to address the assumptions you have and outline possible solutions to the problem.</p><p>When it comes to the pitch itself, after we’ve debated the idea, I personally find it beneficial to focus everyone <a href=\"https://terem.tech/4-questions-product-venture-executives-must-focus-on/\">on four key questions</a>:</p><ol><li>Do we want to be in this space?</li><li>Is this a <em>good enough</em> idea in the space?</li><li>What’s the <em>single biggest</em> assumption we need to address?</li><li>Does this proposed next step address this assumption?</li></ol><h3>Discovery Tools for Non-product People</h3><p>The key tools that a non-product person needs to run a <em>good enough</em> Discovery are:</p><ol><li>Customer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas</li><li>Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)</li><li>Business Model Canvas</li></ol><p>Other tools like wireframing or prototyping tools were considered but have explicitly been omitted. These tools send people inexperienced with discovery too far down the solution path and become distractions from them focusing on the problem and the customer.</p><p>Tools for market sizing and complex financial analysis have also been explicitly omitted. These activities distract from focusing on real customer problems.</p><p>The tools that have been listed really focus the mind on the customer, the customer’s problem, the commercial opportunity and the viability of that opportunity. In the early stages, rough answers and hypotheses are acceptable: perfect is the enemy of done and progress.</p><p>Below is a brief overview of each tool.</p><h4><a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas\">Customer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas</a></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/598/0*2o-07jgufO2sSDVy.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.b2binternational.com/research/methods/faq/what-is-the-value-proposition-canvas/\">B2B International</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Jobs-to-be-Done</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s4YBlRcjs0dnriTL.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb\">Jobs-to-be-Done.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Learn <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-master-your-customers-needs-using-jtbd/\">how to master Jobs-to-be-Done to understand your customer in this article</a>.</p><h4>Business Model Canvas</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rM1m1garVzSRV2Si.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas\">Strategyzer</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Discovery Skills for Non-product People</h3><p>Now that people are armed with the background knowledge, you can work through the foundational skills and tools for doing a discovery:</p><ol><li>How to run early customer interviews:<br>- <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-run-early-customer-interviews/\">A step-by-step guide</a><br>- <a href=\"https://terem.tech/how-to-conduct-excellent-customer-interviews/\">A video on running the interviews themselves</a></li><li><a href=\"https://terem.tech/blog/validate-new-products-features-landing-page-experiments/\">How to use landing page experiments to quickly understand customer behaviour</a></li><li><a href=\"https://terem.tech/6-steps-to-validate-jtbd-with-surveys/\">Surveys to validate Jobs-to-be-Done</a></li></ol><h3>Closing Thoughts &amp; Clarifications</h3><p>There is a lot of knowledge, skills and tools that have been explicitly avoided, anything to do with solutions, market sizing and financials.

Including a list of the benefits, risks for skipping it and false reasons people give for why it isn’t needed.\nWhy Focus on The Customer and Their Problem First?\nThe reason why you focus on the customer (or citizen!) and their problem first is because, at the end of the day, this is where a product succeeds or fails. You need to solve a problem.\nAs a non-product person, helping your product or venture team understand the customer problem is where you can add an immense amount of value, especially because you are probably closer to the customer than they are.\nThe focus on this, really getting this right, is far more important in the early stages of the process than market size, solutions and, even business models. If you understand the problem well, everything else can fall into place and be designed around it. If you get it wrong, then you’ll forever be trying to make up for it, often in an unnecessarily expensive way.\nWhat to Expect From Discovery\nWhen you are doing a discovery, you will likely start with the idea that you think is amazing. Then you’ll begin to explicitly stating your assumptions and interviewing customers. You are going to start learning things about the problem, about your assumptions and your customers that you had not considered.\nIf you’re doing it right, you will almost certainly change direction. You’ll either completely change your thinking, or you’ll make adjustments.\nFollow the problem and your research, not your biases and initial assumptions.\nYou’ll come to the end of your discovery activities and be faced with an end of Discovery decision. You’ll need to consider this before you go ahead and take it to the group that decides whether to proceed or not (it’s usually some kind of committee or executive group, but in smaller companies, it might be an individual).\nKey Concepts to Know\nThere are a few concepts to consider when working through a Discovery. The list below is a refined list selected for non-product people working through the process of getting their idea up.\n\nRecognise the realities of large companies:\n\nNew ideas carry high uncertainty that large companies aren’t used to. Be aware of this and how to deal with it, don’t get caught in a vicious cycle of trying to provide certainty where it isn’t possible.\nThere are corporate forces that work against new products and ventures. Be aware of them, address them head-on.\nCorporations get distracted by market size. It’s not always the right way to think early on with an idea.\n\n2. Understand how product development is approached beyond discovery — start with the principles of a product-led approach.\n3. Focus on customers at the start of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle: Early on, you want and need to focus on customers that will be innovators. The ones that will be ok with early versions of your product, early versions that have less features because they feel the pain strongly and are willing to take some risk. Only once you are succeeding with them will you consider expanding the product to meet the needs of later adopters.\nHow a Decision to Proceed Will be Made\nFinally, you want to have some understanding of how a decision will be made about whether your idea proceeds to whatever the next step in your organisation’s process is.\nMost companies will have a framework or some criteria. Get this ahead of time.\nThen make sure your pitch for proceeding focuses on why it’s worth proceeding to the next stage rather than why you need to Go-to-Market now. It’s easy to get diverted by solutions, market sizing and trends, but it’s usually so early in the evolution of the idea that the idea is easily rejected because it carries too many assumptions or risks.\nInstead, focus on what you have with your newly gained understanding of the customer and the problem. Pitch to address the assumptions you have and outline possible solutions to the problem.\nWhen it comes to the pitch itself, after we’ve debated the idea, I personally find it beneficial to focus everyone on four key questions:\n\nDo we want to be in this space?\nIs this a good enough idea in the space?\nWhat’s the single biggest assumption we need to address?\nDoes this proposed next step address this assumption?\n\nDiscovery Tools for Non-product People\nThe key tools that a non-product person needs to run a good enough Discovery are:\n\nCustomer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas\nJobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)\nBusiness Model Canvas\n\nOther tools like wireframing or prototyping tools were considered but have explicitly been omitted. These tools send people inexperienced with discovery too far down the solution path and become distractions from them focusing on the problem and the customer.\nTools for market sizing and complex financial analysis have also been explicitly omitted. These activities distract from focusing on real customer problems.\nThe tools that have been listed really focus the mind on the customer, the customer’s problem, the commercial opportunity and the viability of that opportunity. In the early stages, rough answers and hypotheses are acceptable: perfect is the enemy of done and progress.\nBelow is a brief overview of each tool.\nCustomer Value Proposition (CVP) Canvas\nSource: B2B International\nJobs-to-be-Done\nSource: Jobs-to-be-Done.com\nLearn how to master Jobs-to-be-Done to understand your customer in this article.\nBusiness Model Canvas\nSource: Strategyzer\nDiscovery Skills for Non-product People\nNow that people are armed with the background knowledge, you can work through the foundational skills and tools for doing a discovery:\n\nHow to run early customer interviews:\n- A step-by-step guide\n- A video on running the interviews themselves\nHow to use landing page experiments to quickly understand customer behaviour\nSurveys to validate Jobs-to-be-Done\n\nClosing Thoughts & Clarifications\nThere is a lot of knowledge, skills and tools that have been explicitly avoided, anything to do with solutions, market sizing and financials. The reason is that, more often than not, these are where non-product people naturally jump towards, and the key to running discovery effectively, at-scale with non-product folks is to get them focused on the customer and the problem.\nBut, uplifting the skills of the people raising ideas isn’t just about the efficiency of the product or venture team tasked with qualifying them out or progressing them.\nWhen you are a product or venture team operating at scale, you have no shortage of ideas and opportunities to assess.\nOriginally published at https://terem.tech on May 23, 2021.\n\nDiscovery for Non-Product People was originally published in Product Coalition on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Scott Middleton","guid":"https://medium.com/p/c10d4336b8ab","categories":["product-discovery","discovery","product-management","skills","product"],"isoDate":"2021-05-25T00:57:36.000Z"},{"creator":"James Wang","title":"Becoming a Product Leader — Introduction","link":"https://productcoalition.com/becoming-a-product-leader-introduction-3410931eb7ce?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Mon, 24 May 2021 21:52:22 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ncmE-ERfaRFUo7B2cDod5Q.png\" /></figure><h3>Becoming a Product Leader — Introduction</h3><p>This is an article series on moving from individual contributor Product Manager to people manager and Product Leader.</p><p>This is something that I’ve personally struggled with, and witnessed brilliant, hardworking, rockstar PMs struggle with.

This week, we delve into why picking success metrics is so challenging yet critical, and Henrik Kniberg shares some vital insights after years of working with Spotify, LEGO, and Minecraft development. Also, we point at how sociotechnical architecture and systems thinking are key to enabling product thinking in organizations.\n\r\n\r\nWe then share an eight-step strategy workshop; we understand why ‘going deep’ is Stripe’s core product principle, and we wonder why some product managers hold on to timeline-based planning while product roadmaps have evolved so rapidly in recent years. \n \r\n\r\nLastly, we analyze the idea of ‘autonomy’ in the workplace, particularly regarding two challenges: the air sandwich and politics.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you miss the previous Food for Agile Thought’s issue #292?\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

However, there are still situations where products can’t be built by just one team. Contrary to popular belief, this is not necessary but often attempted all the same. Building a self-driving car including software and hardware could be a good example where it might be necessary that several hundred people band together. <br>As Willem-Jan mentioned in his article, Scrum provides a solution for that:</p><blockquote>“If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product.

In the article that will follow, I will explore in more detail what exactly you need besides Scrum to have an organization optimized for improved adaptability and customer value.\n\nDo you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?\n\nWhy you can’t compare LeSS to any scaling Framework like SAFe was originally published in Serious Scrum on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Robert Briese","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ce945e0c2fb3","categories":["less","scrum","serious-scrum","scaling","framework"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T19:12:51.000Z"},{"creator":"Juned Ghanchi","title":"How Small Companies Can Benefit From Mobile App Development India?","link":"https://productcoalition.com/how-small-companies-can-benefit-from-mobile-app-development-india-d45d1033fc57?source=rss----384859bd8e6d---4","pubDate":"Thu, 20 May 2021 10:41:45 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DAoAeFaAFI21iVUc_ETKQw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Never before have we seen such an overwhelming boom of small business apps than what we are observing now.

Smartphones are quintessentially personal devices, and hence mobile apps can play a significant role in personalizing customer communication to a great extent.</p><p>By utilizing a mobile app, even small enterprises across the niches enjoy the opportunity to drive customer engagement and create strong bonds.

For example, the use of personalized push notifications helps small enterprises connect customers easily with the right message and at the right time.</p><p>The personalized user experience can be augmented by utilizing the users’ data and location data to unleash mobile promotions, roll out new features, and create a better user experience.</p><h3><strong>Lead generation and Business Conversion</strong></h3><p>Lead generation and steady business conversion happen to be the two most important benefits of mobile apps for small businesses. Many small businesses that have limited scope in interacting directly with customers find mobile apps and social media channels as an effective medium to generate business leads.</p><p>Hyperlocal and highly context-aware marketing of services and products through mobile apps can easily push lead generation and increase business conversion. In addition, thanks to the powerful location-sensing technologies used by today’s mobile apps and because of the scope of using data-driven insights, mobile apps can play a great role in engaging customers based on their location and the specific user context.</p><p>A retail business now can easily facilitate omnichannel targeting of customers with the mobile apps playing the central role in coordinating with different channels.

Operational efficiency is a key reason for many small businesses to embrace mobile apps.</p><p>Companies relying heavily on the field staff can benefit tremendously from mobile apps.

Real-time information tracking and smooth collaboration powered by cloud apps ensure saving time and resources for any company.</p><h3><strong>Taking on the Opportunities of On-demand Mobile Apps</strong></h3><p>With the overwhelming success of Uber as the on-demand cab service app, the business model has given birth to too many on-demand apps catering to different service requirements across all niches.

It stands out as a digital interface right on the mobile screen and keeps the brand visible all the time for the users. A customer accessing your brand through the website may not return again or quite often. But a customer using your app knows your brand more personal and is likely to interact with your brand quite often.</p><p>The mobile app can help retain users with more certainty than any other digital interface.

Not only from a relational point of view but also from a productive point of view.</p><p>In particular, the benefits of working in a team collaboratively are:</p><p><strong>Reduction of processing times</strong>: when several people work cooperatively on the same project they are focused and aligned. This avoids rework and misunderstandings and it is possible to reduce the delivery times of a project. Cooperatively working is addressed by the Scrum values of <strong>“Courage” </strong>and<strong> “Focus”.</strong></p><p><strong>Mutual exchange of skills and ideas</strong>: having multiple points of view on the same topic allows you to create a complete and multifaceted product. This is addressed by the Scrum values of <strong>“Respect” </strong>and<strong> “Openness”.</strong></p><p><strong>Ability to rely on your teammates</strong>: if a member of the group is in difficulty or is going through a moment of discouragement, it is essential that the other members of the group — strong in their emotional intelligence — can support him adequately. Helping teammates is addressed by the Scrum values of <strong>“Commitment” </strong>and<strong> “Focus”.</strong></p><p>Soft skills can make a difference within a workgroup. In particular, problem-solving skills and empathy are very powerful tools that allow you to support the team until the shared goals are achieved.</p><h3>Ways to improve collaboration</h3><h4><strong>Work with clear Goals</strong></h4><p>Working with the Scrum framework, the team commits to:</p><ul><li>Product Goal</li><li>Sprint Goal</li><li>Definition of Done</li></ul><p>As Scrum Master coach the team about the importance of goals. I have seen it is very useful to have separate coaching, versus Product Owner and versus Developer.</p><p>a) <strong>Coaching the Product Owner about the Product Goal: </strong>explain why the goal is important. Explain that the goal aligns stakeholders and the development team, directing their work. Explain that<strong> </strong>meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business.</p><p>b) <strong>Coaching the Scrum Team about the Sprint Goal: </strong>explain why it is important. Explain that<strong> </strong>a Sprint Goal serves to promote <strong><em>self-managing </em>and <em>creativity</em></strong>. It establishes the ‘<strong><em>why</em></strong>’ so the Development Team can work out the ‘<strong><em>how</em></strong>’.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*umkEyH9gwFaJdf--\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@enginakyurt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">engin akyurt</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Improve the Sprint Planning</h4><p>The Sprint Planning is an important moment to foster collaboration.</p><p>Be sure that the product backlog is prepared for the Sprint Planning, meaning that the Product Backlog Items are ordered, and the ones on the top are refined to a level the Team can start working on. This avoid a lot of discussion and let the developers concentrate on preparing a sprint where collaboration is the main focus.</p><p>This preparation could happen in many ways, as example thru pair programming, or by preparing the work in such a way that it can easily be shared.</p><h4><strong>Create the culture of asking “why”</strong></h4><p>The “<strong>what</strong>” and the “<strong>how</strong>” are important in the daily job of a team member.

This will help you and your team to succeed with Scrum.\nBecause, ultimately, more than on the rules of Scrum, the benefits realized through Scrum depend on the interactions and collaboration of the people employing Scrum. — Gunther Verheyen\nPhoto by Mitchell Luo on Unsplash\nBenefits of a collaborative team\nCollaboratively working in a team brings concrete benefits. Not only from a relational point of view but also from a productive point of view.\nIn particular, the benefits of working in a team collaboratively are:\nReduction of processing times: when several people work cooperatively on the same project they are focused and aligned. This avoids rework and misunderstandings and it is possible to reduce the delivery times of a project. Cooperatively working is addressed by the Scrum values of “Courage” and “Focus”.\nMutual exchange of skills and ideas: having multiple points of view on the same topic allows you to create a complete and multifaceted product. This is addressed by the Scrum values of “Respect” and “Openness”.\nAbility to rely on your teammates: if a member of the group is in difficulty or is going through a moment of discouragement, it is essential that the other members of the group — strong in their emotional intelligence — can support him adequately. Helping teammates is addressed by the Scrum values of “Commitment” and “Focus”.\nSoft skills can make a difference within a workgroup. In particular, problem-solving skills and empathy are very powerful tools that allow you to support the team until the shared goals are achieved.\nWays to improve collaboration\nWork with clear Goals\nWorking with the Scrum framework, the team commits to:\n\nProduct Goal\nSprint Goal\nDefinition of Done\n\nAs Scrum Master coach the team about the importance of goals. I have seen it is very useful to have separate coaching, versus Product Owner and versus Developer.\na) Coaching the Product Owner about the Product Goal: explain why the goal is important. Explain that the goal aligns stakeholders and the development team, directing their work. Explain that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business.\nb) Coaching the Scrum Team about the Sprint Goal: explain why it is important. Explain that a Sprint Goal serves to promote self-managing and creativity. It establishes the ‘why’ so the Development Team can work out the ‘how’.\nPhoto by engin akyurt on Unsplash\nImprove the Sprint Planning\nThe Sprint Planning is an important moment to foster collaboration.\nBe sure that the product backlog is prepared for the Sprint Planning, meaning that the Product Backlog Items are ordered, and the ones on the top are refined to a level the Team can start working on. This avoid a lot of discussion and let the developers concentrate on preparing a sprint where collaboration is the main focus.\nThis preparation could happen in many ways, as example thru pair programming, or by preparing the work in such a way that it can easily be shared.\nCreate the culture of asking “why”\nThe “what” and the “how” are important in the daily job of a team member. But the “why” we are doing things, is even more important.\nFor all members of the Scrum Team, it is the most efficient way to gain deeper insights into the projects they are working on. You can refine requirements by asking the right kinds of questions, based on the problem you are trying to solve. If you keep raising questions, you will keep finding better answers and implementing exactly what should be done.\nAs a Scrum Master coach the team that asking questions is a sign of strength and intelligence, not a sign of weakness or uncertainty. And especially when there is a hurry to get things done do not fall in the trap of stopping to ask questions because it might slow them down.

Discussions are a healthy way of improving the way forward.\nBut the discussion should be fact-based and respectful towards the other team members. I find the STAR method is a powerful tool for giving objective feedback.\nHere are the 4 steps:\n\nSITUATION: in which the behavior took place\nTASK: assigned task or expected behavior in line with the organizational culture\nACTION: the observed behavior\nRESULT: the effect resulting from the observed behavior\n\nLet´s see an example: Instead of telling “You were too negative in a meeting!”, following approach suits better acceptance:\n\nSITUATION: during yesterday’s meeting\nTASK: we asked you to highlight the benefits of Mike’s proposal\nACTION: instead, you described only the elements that in your opinion are ineffective\nRESULT: and this generated silence in Mike and the team, making us miss a profitable discussion\n\nUse positive language\nLanguage is the result of our thinking and our emotion\nPositive language can direct our thinking towards solutions. And avoid us getting stuck on the problem.\nPositive language is to be used when we want our interlocutor to perceive us as an ally.\nRemember that a positive language fosters the Scrum Value of “respect”.\nExamples of positive phrasing and language (more can be found in The Power of Positive Communication)\n1. Highlight what can be done\nExample: If you can send us (whatever), we can complete the process for you.\n2. Suggest alternatives and choices\nExample: One option open to you is (option)\n3. Sound helpful and encouraging rather than bureaucratic\nExample: Might we suggest that you (whatever)\nCelebrate success\nAt the sprint planning, the Scrum Team set some goals for the upcoming sprint.\nFor the team morale it is good to celebrate the success of reaching such goals. As a Scrum Master foster the idea of celebration. A high-performing team is happy to see recognized the results of its hard work.\nThe Following Scrum events could be suitable for this celebration:\n\nDuring the Daily, when a goal is reached, this could be highlighted.\nIn each Sprint Review, when stakeholders are invited to participate. It is the time to celebrate the valuable increment which has just been delivered.\nThe Sprint Retrospective may also be a good place to celebrate some other wins that may not be of interest to the external stakeholders of the team.\nPhoto by krakenimages on Unsplash\nConclusion\nTeam collaboration is an important factor for team success. The Scrum Master should watch the status of the collaboration, and continuously improve it.\nThe six suggestions discussed previously provide you with concrete tools for archiving it.\n\nDo you want to write for Serious Scrum or seriously discuss Scrum?\n\nScrum Master: 6 Concrete Ways to Improve Collaboration was originally published in Serious Scrum on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Alessandro Zanetti","guid":"https://medium.com/p/45f01ca630f8","categories":["team-building","serious-scrum","agile","coaching","scrum-master"],"isoDate":"2021-05-19T16:38:19.000Z"},{"creator":"hunterwalk","title":"How Pro Skateboarder Tony Hawk Made Me A Better Parent","link":"https://hunterwalk.com/2021/05/19/how-pro-skateboarder-tony-hawk-made-me-a-better-parent/","pubDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 16:02:28 +0000","content:encoded":"\n<h2 id=\"d3e2\">Teaching my daughter that ‘adventure boo-boos’ are part of life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I come from a family of flinchers.

Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity. It is a sign for an organization still profoundly stuck in industrial paradigm thinking.\n\r\n\r\nJoin me and explore the reasons and the consequences of this Scrum anti-pattern in 110 seconds.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🗞 Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p><p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)</p><p>What Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

Honoring the companies we missed.”\nhttps://medium.com/media/138f4c7d25491ead7a04bce6ccdf5900/href\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility. (After all, Scrum is a team sport, and no one is benching.)\nWhat Scrum stakeholder anti-patterns have you observed?

While stakeholders are not an official accountability, the Scrum Guide makes numerous references to stakeholders in Scrum:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Page 4: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 5: The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 6: The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 6: The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 6: Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 7: The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 7: The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 8: The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 8: [Sprint Planning: Why is this Sprint valuable?] The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 9: The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 9: During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 10: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 10: These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 12: However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint.</li>\r\n\t<li>Page 12: The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\" title=\"The Scrum Guide 2020 — Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Scrum Guide on stakeholders</a>.

Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.</li>\r\n\t<li>The organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.</li>\r\n\t<li>Middle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/stakeholder-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCSYSDED4C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time.

As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “<a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio\" title=\"The Anti-Portfolio.

Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility.

(This aggregation is from the Scrum Guide 2020 Reordered.)\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me point at three Scrum stakeholder failures that have the potential to derail your organization’s attempt at achieving business agility with Scrum:\n\r\n\r\nTurning the Sprint Review into a Stakeholder Approval Instance\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the Sprint Review acceptance gate by stakeholders is an anti-pattern typical for organizations that are still rooted in the industrial paradigm, exercising command & control. Some of the reasons for this anti-pattern are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nA “my budget, my feature” attitude on the stakeholder side. The Scrum Team is seen as an internal agency, delivering requirements issued by the stakeholders.\n\r\n\t\nThe organization probably follows a metered funding approach, for example, providing a budget for the Scrum Team’s development effort only for a short period.\n\r\n\t\nThere is a general lack of trust in a Scrum Team’s ability to manage itself successfully.\n\r\n\t\nMiddle managers might even fear becoming obsolete after a successful agile transformation and try to stay their ground.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, this example among stakeholder failures is a sign for an agile transformation that is not fully supported by all stakeholders.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nCoders Code; They Don’t Talk to Customers\n\r\n\r\nAdhering to the inherited functional silos, Developers are supposed to deliver “code” and only code. They are not supposed to talk to customers or take over customer support duties to understand their problems first-hand.\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, that is pure Taylorism at work, entirely output-oriented. The problem is, we are no longer assembling Model-Ts. But we go every day, where no one has ever gone before. In a complex environment, those closest to a problem are best suited to make the right decision to solve it. \n\r\n\r\nHence, it becomes necessary that all Scrum team members talk directly with customers to understand their challenges better and avoid the misallocation of the Scrum team’s development time. (My rule of thumb: Coding is no more than 50 % of the whole effort of creating value for our customers. The best way to increase the productivity of a Scrum team is to avoid building unnecessary stuff. Now, guess how you can best address this issue? Right: Developers talk to customers.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Is no Failure Culture\n \r\n\r\nA former client of mine, a large utility company, practiced at the time a no-failure approach to promotions: A failed project on your internal record meant you would not take the next step on the career ladder. As a result, everyone played safe, which resulted in short-term orientation as not-failing became more important than innovation. Consequently, the organization was increasingly struggling to attract new (tech) talent when software started eating the world.\n\r\n\r\nSuppose “good” failure is not celebrated as a critical part of the learning process, and incrementalism becomes the name of the game. In that case, the Innovator’s Dilemma, as coined by Clayton Christensen, becomes a more likely fate of the organization. When resilience is a worthwhile goal to achieve, think of Netflix’s chaos monkey, failure needs to be an option. \n\r\n\r\nAnd failure needs to be openly discussed—without repercussions—so everyone can learn from the case. And as it should be, leaders need to confess first. One approach could “failure nights,” or sharing your wrong decisions from the past openly. For example, see Bessemer Venture Partners’ “The Anti-Portfolio. Honoring the companies we missed.”\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Stakeholder Failures\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Scrum Guide is not honoring the crucial contribution of stakeholders for the Scrum team’s success formally, it does acknowledge their importance on numerous occasions. Interestingly, despite the severe consequences of stakeholders failing their Scrum teams, stakeholders are often not a prime focus of Scrum Masters. (Probably, because the organization is reserving the job to “agile coaches?” That would be just another anti-patterns at the organizational level.)\n \r\n\r\nAs a result of this neglect, these stakeholder failures may create teams of mercenaries that trade time to collect a paycheque at the end of the month, which paves the path to mediocrity, not to business agility.

But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholders</a> such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">generate as much buy-in as possible</a>, as I explain in more detail in my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16393\">Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People</a>.&#8221; But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don&#8217;t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires <em>full-stack ownership</em>: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a> to the product details. The individual should carry out<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\"> product discovery</a> and strategy work in addition to taking care of the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">product backlog work</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5822\">Scaling the Product Owner</a>.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png\" alt=\"Full-stack product owner vs. partial product owner\" class=\"wp-image-17099\" width=\"661\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-300x147.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO-768x377.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/full-stack-PO-vs-partial-PO.png 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Be therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role. This has created more confusion and increased the misconceptions of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: The product owner is responsible for the team performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An agile development team does a good job if the memebers can reliably meet the agreed goals and create software that offers a great user experience and exhibit the desired quality. As such a team is a self-managing group, the members are expected to jointly plan the work, decide how it is carried out, track the progress, resolve any disagreements and conflicts, and practice sustainable pace to stay productive and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it takes time for group of people to become an effective self-managing team and learn to make realistic commitments, the dev team needs a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach who supports and advises them. This includes showing the dev team how agile processes can be applied and suggesting specific techniques, facilitating meetings, and teaching people how to constructively deal with conflicts. In other words, the Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the product owner, you should focus on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10812\">product</a>, not the team and the process. That’s usually challenging enough. Don’t make the mistake to cover the Scrum Master’s work over an extended period, as this will either cause you to neglect some of your core responsibilities or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sustainable-pace-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14746\">sacrifice your health</a>—neither of which is desirable, of course. If you lack a Scrum Master, or if the individual is not sufficiently available or qualified, then consider what you can do to address this issue. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to make the problem visible rather than carrying out some of the Scrum Master’s tasks and thereby masking the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, don’t make the mistake to interfere with the work of the development team. For example, it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do in a sprint or to start assigning tasks to individuals. This damages the team’s self-management; it takes away ownership from the group; and it makes the dev team dependent on you as the person who sorts out their problems for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you are not responsible for the team performance, you should, of course, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">care about the development teams</a> you work with and offer helpful feedback and guidance. A great way to resolve any performance issues is to address them in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-owner-sprint-retrospective/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8232\">sprint retrospective</a>. Dig down to the root causes of the problem and explore how <em>you</em> can help improve the situation. This might include involving the team members in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery work</a>, spending more time jointly <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/refining-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15179\">refining the product backlog</a>, or making yourself available to answer urgent questions and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">review finished work</a> results during the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #4: The product owner is responsible for writing user stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are a popular technique to capture end-user functionality. But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3256\">Refining the product backlog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">writing user stories</a> is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones. You might even delegate some of the refinement work to the dev team, assuming that people are happy and appropriately skilled to take it on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is important that you don&#8217;t neglect the product backlog work, as the following story shows. A few years ago, I worked with an organisation that has become a leading provider to hire trusted handymen in the UK like plumbers and electricians. Their product owner asked me for help telling me that the dev team would always over-promise and then under-deliver. After looking at the product backlog—which consisted of a collection of adhesive notes on an office wall at this time—I quickly realised why the team was struggling so much: The backlog contained only <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a>, big, coarse-grained user stories but no detailed, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> items. Development teams, however, need sufficiently detailed product backlog items to be able to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-planning-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14390\">create a realistic forecast for what can be done in a sprint</a> and succeed in meeting the sprint goal. If the items are too big and coarse-grained, most teams will struggle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, strike the right balance between strategic and tactical work and spend enough time working on the product backlog together with the development team members. As the product owner, it&#8217;s your responsibility that the work required to progress the product and reach the (next) <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">product goal</a> is adequately captured in the product backlog. Such a backlog has enough “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>” high-priority items to guide the work of the development team and to allow its members to create a “done” product increment—executable software that is tested and documented and that could be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #5: It’s the product owner’s job to get the project delivered</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional approaches to software development, Scrum does not offer the role of a project manager. It can therefore be tempting to view the product owner as a project manager substitute. But this would be a mistake. Project management is collectively practiced in Scrum rather than carried out by an individual. What’s more, the product owner is a <em>product management</em> role responsible for managing the product and achieving product success—not for delivering a project. This requires the product owner to look after the product on a continued basis and manage its life cycle—or at least large parts of it. To put it differently, you can think of the product owner as a product life-cycle manager, which encourages decisions that result in sustainable growth and consider the product’s longer-term impact on the users and the business. The picture below illustrates this concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png\" alt=\"Product owner and the product life cycle\" class=\"wp-image-17100\" width=\"525\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager.png 1008w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-300x235.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/po-as-life-cycle-manager-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture above shows how a product might create value over time together with three key events: launching the product, achieving product-market fit, and retiring the product (end of life). Only once it has achieved product-market fit (PMF) and entered the growth stage, has a product started to become successful. A product owner should therefore look after a product at least until PMF, preferably longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with the job of a project manager who is responsible for delivering a project to an agreed scope on time and on budget. Once that’s been achieved, the project manager’s work is done, and the individual often moves on and works on another project, which might progress a different product. A project manager is therefore focused on a comparatively short-term effort instead of a longer-term outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, avoid being a <em>project</em> owner but aspire to manage your product for an extended period, ideally for its entire life cycle. This does not imply, however, that you should not care about meeting a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goal</a> in a realistic timeframe on an agreed budget. The opposite is the case: Use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release planning tools and techniques</a> that work for you to track and guide the development progress. But create a continuity of purpose by working with a product roadmap like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">GO roadmap</a> that captures the specific outcomes the product is likely to create in the next six to twelve months.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/five-product-owner-myths-busted/\">Five Product Owner Myths Busted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Myth #1: The product owner must ensure that the stakeholders are satisfied\nStakeholders can be powerful and influential individuals. But the value a product creates is ultimately determined by its users: No product will be successful in the long run if it does not solve a specific user problem, create a tangible benefit, or help the users achieve a specific goal. While internal stakeholders such as marketing, sales, and support play an important role in successfully offering a product, it would be wrong to try to please them and to say yes to all their ideas and requests. In the worst case, you’d end up with a product that implements the stakeholders’ requirements but does not effectively address the user and customer needs.\nAt the same token, ignoring the stakeholders or excluding them from important product decisions is not helpful either. Instead, you should engage the stakeholders, leverage their expertise, and generate as much buy-in as possible, as I explain in more detail in my article “Stakeholder Management Tips for Product People.” But do not allow people to dominate and tell you what to do, and don’t agree to a weak compromise. As the product owner, then you should own the product on behalf of the company and be empowered to have the final say, particularly if no agreement can be reached.\nMyth #2: The product owner is a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog\nIn Scrum—the framework that gave birth to the product owner—the role is responsible for maximising the value a product creates for the users and for the business. This requires full-stack ownership: having the authority to make strategic product decisions in addition to tactical ones. Consequently, a Scrum product owner should own a product in its entirety—from the product vision to the product details. The individual should carry out product discovery and strategy work in addition to taking care of the product backlog work.\nBut the situation is different for product owners in the agile scaling framework SAFe. The framework uses its own product owner role, which is different from the one in Scrum. The SAFe product owner is tactical in nature and focuses on working on the product backlog and guiding the development teams. The strategic work is taken on by another role, the SAFe product manager. Splitting product ownership and using a strategic and tactical role is a common scaling technique—although not necessarily the most helpful one, as I discuss in more detail in my article “Scaling the Product Owner.” The following picture summarises the difference between the Scrum and SAFe product owner roles.\n\nBe therefore clear which product owner role you play and if you are a Scrum or a SAFe product owner, as your authority and accountability will significantly differ. I have always regarded the Scrum product owner as an agile product manager, and I find it an unfortunate mistake that SAFe use the same name for its tactical product role.

But as product owner, you are not a user story scribe or a product backlog manager. Refining the product backlog and writing user stories is teamwork: The development team members should actively contribute to removing, changing, and adding backlog items, as well as breaking larger stories into smaller ones.

Referring to the Stacey Matrix, applying Scrum to the areas “Chaos” and “Simple” is a waste. Scrum is best used in the “Complex” area. Here, empirical process control thrives, applying transparency, inspection, and adaptation to iteratively, incrementally developing valuable product Increments, thus mitigating risk.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for High Product Quality\n\r\n\r\nFrom day one, keep technical debt small and work continuously on high product quality, reflected in the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done. Achieving business agility requires dedication to product quality and excellence at the technical level. (Learn more: Technical Debt & Scrum: Who Is Responsible?\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\nCreate and Maintain an Actionable Product Backlog\n\r\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out: No matter how your Scrum Team is everything else, a sub-standard Product Backlog will diminish all other team achievements. Hence, it would be best to support the Product Owner and the Developers to maintain a permanently “actionable” Product Backlog. By “actionable,” I am referring to a refinement level of the Product Backlog that would allow a Scrum Team to run a meaningful Sprint Planning at a moment’s notice. (Learn more: 28 Product Backlog and Refinement Anti-Patterns.) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace Self-Management and Take It to the Scrum Team\n\r\n\r\nRestrain from solving problems that your teammates can solve themselves. I know it feels good to be helpful; however, it is not your job as a Scrum Master to become the team’s helping hand in all matters. Instead, make self-management our number one priority and ensure that everyone lives Scrum Values. Be a servant-leader at heart and, therefore, a good role model for the Scrum team.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll sketches are taken from a previous Professional Scrum Master class; check out my upcoming training classes here.\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\n\r\n\r\nIt helps while identifying the success principles of a Scrum Master to take an outside perspective. For example, if I had to summarize everyone’s expectations regarding the work of a Scrum Team in a single sentence, it would be this one: The Scrum team delivers—with the precision of a Swiss clockwork—a Done, potentially releasable, valuable Product Increment every single Sprint.\n\r\n\r\nWhat principles are guiding your work as a Scrum Master?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches. We appreciate a new ebook on dealing with difficult stakeholders and critical situations, and we learn a simple approach to measuring team productivity: Don’t touch velocity! </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we learn that Gitlab identified a new DevOps maturity model. </p>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg\" alt=\"Food for Agile Thought #291: Hypotheses Validation, Authentic Feedback, Measuring Productivity, The Art of Removing Features — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65945\" data-wp-pid=\"65945\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation.jpg 1024w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Food-Agile-Thought-291-hypotheses-validation-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-65937\"></span>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you miss the previous <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/food-agile-thought-290-design-thinking-scrum/\" title=\"Food for Agile Thought #290: Design Thinking Scrum, Product vs. Project Teams, Agile Leadership Practice Library, Disrupting Disrupters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food for Agile Thought’s issue #290</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🗞 <em>Shall I notify you about articles like this one?

This week, we delve into hypotheses validation, and we shine a light on why it is often hard to have an authentic conversation and what you can do about it. We also stress the importance of modeling and measuring culture and analyze critical problems at the leadership level of organizations that result in a 70 % failure rate of transformations.\n\r\n\r\nWe then wonder why so many product managers want to create strategies while we derive all the signals for further product growth from the operational work in the trenches.

Assume as CEO that it will be impossible to retain 100% of your employees no matter what you decide. There’s going to be a talent reshuffling for the next 6–24 months IMO as employees decide whether their current employer’s workplace strategy is right for them or not.\nAnd resist the urge to reduce this to assumptions like “equitable workplaces are those with the fewest mandates.” These choices are complex, often with unintended consequences. Flexible schedules more friendly for women? Unclear according to this WSJ article:\nDenise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, said hybrid models appear to offer the benefits of both worlds. But they could inadvertently disadvantage women, who shoulder the bulk of caregiving duties and may be more likely to seek more home-based arrangements and miss out on professional face-time, she said. Any solution to one problem will raise other challenges, she said.\n\n\n\n\nThe President of Barnard College fears similar and notes it’s about systems of choices, not just a single decision:\nSo what should well-intentioned companies and managers do? If you think flexible work will boost equity, especially for parents, it is critical to consider what other policies and practices must be in place to advance this goal. Providing paid family and parental leave — as opposed to just maternity leave — and encouraging employees to take it is one example. Ensuring managers do not favor in-person employees for mentorships, in evaluations or for other opportunities is another.\n\n\n\n\nSo start thinking about what’s right for your stage of company, the type of product you build, the culture you’ve created, and then prepare for a lot of communication over the second half of the year.","dc:creator":"hunterwalk","content":"Engage your team and understand their needs but craft your “Return To Office” strategy from the top down We’ve backed a wide variety of startups at Homebrew but the CEOs are now all coalescing around one theme: it’s time to start making choices about what ‘back to the office’ looks like (note 95%+ of our [&#8230;]","contentSnippet":"Engage your team and understand their needs but craft your “Return To Office” strategy from the top down We’ve backed a wide variety of startups at Homebrew but the CEOs are now all coalescing around one theme: it’s time to start making choices about what ‘back to the office’ looks like (note 95%+ of our […]","guid":"https://hunterwalk.com/?p=9317","categories":["Uncategorized"],"isoDate":"2021-05-08T04:05:17.000Z"},{"creator":"Stefan Wolpers","title":"The Blame Game Retrospective — Making Your Scrum Work #6","link":"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/","pubDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 13:07:10 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>TL; DR: The Blame Game Retrospective </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum.

The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\u000b\r\n\t<li>Commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b</li>\r\n\t<li>If Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives — Scrum Values — Age-of-Product.com\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65925\" data-wp-pid=\"65925\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" srcset=\"https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values.jpg 1600w, https://48afe8uw4eh2mwl861852ss1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Date-Informed-Retrospectives-Scrum-Values-825x413.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: <a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/data-informed-retrospectives/\" title=\"Data-Informed Retrospectives\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data-Informed Retrospectives</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/blame-game-retrospective-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0EHmvUIngkQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure.

The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.\n\r\n\r\nSource: Scrum Guide 2020.\n\r\n\r\nWhy Playing the Blame Game Retrospective Is an Indicator for the Scrum Team’s Professionalism\n\r\n\r\nThe Retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger-pointing. The point is that Scrum is a team sport: The team wins together; the team loses together. The blame game Retrospective hence documents the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator as well as the Scrum team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it? Revisit the Scrum Values as a Scrum Team: \n\r\n\r\n\u000b\r\n\t\nCommitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect—without them, transparency, inspection, and adaptation cannot work their magic. \u000b\n\r\n\t\nIf Scrum Values are a challenge, create, for example, a skill-radar for Scrum Values and visualize its development over time.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about how to create Scrum Value radars: Data-Informed Retrospectives.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blame Game Retrospective — Conclusion\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which a Sprint Retrospective can be a failure. Among those, the blame game, the finger-pointing, is the most obvious and challenging that requires the utmost attention from all team members to overcome.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sprint Retrospective anti-patterns have you observed?

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner\" title=\"The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner \" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Oversized Product Backlogs</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>The Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Garbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers &#038; the organization. </li>\r\n\t<li>The Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpet3ZRyTx34%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Product Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You are likely to end up in a feature factory.</li>\r\n\t<li>Probably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" title=\"Conway’s law\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conway’s law</a>: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.”)</li>\r\n\t<li>If you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fgc15kRtrNVg%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><script async data-uid=\"de05173d75\" src=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75/index.js\"></script></p><p class=\"convertkit-amp\">Cannot see the form? <br />Please <a href=\"https://berlin-product-people-gmbh.ck.page/de05173d75\" target>click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>I Know What to Build—Follow Me!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks &#038; balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://age-of-product.com/product-owner-failures-making-your-scrum-work/\"><img src=\"https://age-of-product.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0Zl-FMOjS9U%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point.

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. […] For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. […] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\nSource: The Scrum Guide on the Product Owner.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nLet me “walk” you through often observed Product Owner anti-patterns, from oversized Product Backlogs to prioritization by proxy to the omniscient Product Owner:\n\r\n\r\nOversized Product Backlogs\n \r\n\r\nThe Product Backlog of your team comprises hundreds of entries, from user stories to ideas to hypotheses and experiments to documentation fragments—you name it. Dumping everything into the Product Backlog—probably in the name of transparency—poses a massive challenge for various reasons:\n\r\n\r\n\t\nGarbage in, garbage out: Increasing the quantity of input does not increase the outcome of the Scrum Team’s work. In other words: Being“ busy” ≠ providing value to customers & the organization. \n\r\n\t\nThe Product Backlog is the Scrum Team’s best chance to identify every Sprint the best way ahead to make your customers’ lives easier. Hence you need signals, not noise. Too many entries may make teammates less inclined to engage in the Product Backlog refinement actively.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Apply the Goldilocks principle—“just right”—and find your balance as a team. Then, dump the rest. You want an actionable Product Backlog that comprises eight to maybe twelve weeks of work. Be warned, though: Typical objections to deleting unnecessary Product Backlog items range from “we cannot delete them—it is our documentation as required by governance” to “we invested so much work in creating them.” (The former is a form of loss aversion, the latter a manifestation of the sunk cost syndrome.)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritization by Proxy — Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nProduct Owners do not represent a committee—see above—and are hence solely accountable for the maximization of value created on behalf of the customers. Nevertheless, in many organizations, stakeholders see Product Owners primarily as a tactical role, turning requirement documents into Jira tasks.\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for that attitude, from being in the early phase of a transformation—thus being less skilled in Scrum—to a general lack of trust in the capabilities of the Scrum Team. No matter the reason, Product Owners in this situation should team up with their Scrum Masters and try to fill the role in the intended way. Otherwise, you may face grave consequences:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\nYou are likely to end up in a feature factory.\n\r\n\t\nProbably, you will be shipping the org chart instead of creating real value for the customer. (Conway’s law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”)\n\r\n\t\nIf you practice metered funding for the Scrum Team, on top of that, it is like introducing Waterfall 2.0 through the backdoor.\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCannot see the form? \nPlease click here.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Know What to Build—Follow Me!\n\r\n\r\nIn this PO anti-pattern, Product Owners know best where to go the create value for the customers. They provide the “why, what, and how” and do not doubt that they are best suited to make investment decisions. They expect the rest of the Scrum Team to fall in line and follow their lead. \n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this attitude renders success-critical checks & balances useless. The Developers are supposed to challenge the Product Owner: “PO, is this really the best use of our time?” As a Scrum Team, we want our Product Owners to fall in love with our customers’ problems, not their solutions.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: Three Wide-Spread Product Owner Failures\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the Product Owner role is the most challenging Scrum accountability, and the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fail them. Nevertheless, the concept of continuous improvement also applies to the Product Owner role. The examples of Product Owner anti-patterns above may be a starting point. As a Product Owner, just reach out to your teammates and ask for support. After all, Scrum is a team sport.\n\r\n\r\nWhat Product Owner failures have you observed?

For those who know me well, it’s pretty much, “Yeah, duh.” But for those who have only been exposed to me in public settings, or online, there’s usually more surprise that a venture capitalist like me could be an introvert.&nbsp;People sometimes mistake introversion for shyness or lack of confidence.&nbsp;But it’s really about whether being with people&nbsp;<em>gives</em>&nbsp;you energy or&nbsp;<em>takes</em>&nbsp;energy away.&nbsp;I love people, I just need adequate amounts of time to recharge, usually spent by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re human, which means the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/a-year-of-zoom-genitals-bourbon-bottles-child-rearing-632167ea052d\">past 12 months</a>&nbsp;were probably pretty tumultuous for you. My family has been incredibly fortunate and hopefully, the long-term consequences are going to be minimal. Lately, I’ve found myself mostly trying to figure out what lessons my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/what-lessons-will-our-children-learn-from-covid19-and-will-they-be-useful-ones-e2635eb3dfe7\">daughter should learn from this time</a>, and what lessons we specifically&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;want her to carry throughout her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to my job, after practicing venture capital for seven years under normal circumstances, it was instructive to get thrown into this new scenario, because I don’t think we’ll ever fully “return to normal.” Instead, we’ll blend aspects of pre-2020 and our experiences from the past year into a “new normal.” This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people. It’s a work-in-process but here’s what I’m thinking:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Group events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, these would always trip me up. I would experience some social anxiety mixed with generally feeling overwhelmed by my own internal scorecarding and thoughts of, “Am I networking enough?” Now on Zoom, I can just fall back to audio-only, or drop off the gathering when I’m ready to leave. (What’s the “turn off video” equivalent for me when being at a large event? Probably peeling away with a person or two for the ol’ walk and talk.) Going forward, I think virtual events will continue to evolve beyond the Zoom room and into formats like Icebreaker. I can’t say that Covid-19 has made me rethink the personal utility of the really big conferences (I don’t attend many), but it does make me miss the curation of smaller groups.&nbsp;The events where hosts put effort into bringing together people with a high degree of purpose and work hard to ensure mixing, those are wonderful. My 2022 will hopefully include a return to events like these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working with founders</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what I really have missed.&nbsp;You might think I’m referring to the time spent with a founder before deciding to make an investment in their startup, and certainly, there are moments where an in-person conversation can be the difference between Deal or No Deal. But I don’t think we’ll ever go back to 100% in-person pitching, especially in the earliest stages of getting to know someone.&nbsp;It’s just too mutually efficient to make a first pitch into a call or video, especially if the founders prefer it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>What I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.&nbsp;Not the perfunctory showing up in person for a board meeting (although sometimes being there is important), but rather the stuff which requires as much EQ (or emotional intelligence) as IQ. And I’m anticipating doing a lot of this in the places our portfolio companies are scattered: the Bay Area, New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Toronto, Portland, San Diego, Boston, Salt Lake City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I sense lots of startup teams are ready to get back into offices as well or at least have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/the-essential-nature-of-in-person-work-for-early-stage-startups-3a19e24342fc\">flexibility to work in-person</a>&nbsp;for the periods where collaboration and culture-building are most essential. If I were early in my career, it would absolutely be my preference to work for a company with an in-office culture (either full-time or hybrid). There’s just so much community and&nbsp;learning-by-osmosis (or serendipity) that comes from being together.&nbsp;So while our VC firm&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homebrew.co/\">Homebrew</a>&nbsp;definitely invests in companies that are 100% remote/distributed, we also espouse being intentional about what it means to do so and not underinvest in the infrastructure, travel, and skill-building it takes to succeed in this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work-life balance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we still call it this?&nbsp;How about just happiness and sanity?&nbsp;I’ve found that I really enjoy driving my kid to school on Friday mornings. I’ve found that playing backgammon with my wife over lunch is nice when our mutual schedules accommodate. I’ve grown increasingly fond of just talking on the phone with a founder for five minutes when they need some help (versus going back and forth over email).&nbsp;Optimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain.&nbsp;My weekdays are basically 80% Homebrew, 20% family, with my weekends being the reverse.

For those who know me well, it’s pretty much, “Yeah, duh.” But for those who have only been exposed to me in public settings, or online, there’s usually more surprise that a venture capitalist like me could be an introvert. People sometimes mistake introversion for shyness or lack of confidence. But it’s really about whether being with people gives you energy or takes energy away. I love people, I just need adequate amounts of time to recharge, usually spent by myself.\nIf you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re human, which means the past 12 months were probably pretty tumultuous for you. My family has been incredibly fortunate and hopefully, the long-term consequences are going to be minimal. Lately, I’ve found myself mostly trying to figure out what lessons my daughter should learn from this time, and what lessons we specifically don’t want her to carry throughout her life.\nThis has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people.\nWhen it comes to my job, after practicing venture capital for seven years under normal circumstances, it was instructive to get thrown into this new scenario, because I don’t think we’ll ever fully “return to normal.” Instead, we’ll blend aspects of pre-2020 and our experiences from the past year into a “new normal.” This has given me a chance to redefine my own habits as an introvert — especially those related to how, where, and when I spend time with people. It’s a work-in-process but here’s what I’m thinking:\nGroup events\nIn the past, these would always trip me up. I would experience some social anxiety mixed with generally feeling overwhelmed by my own internal scorecarding and thoughts of, “Am I networking enough?” Now on Zoom, I can just fall back to audio-only, or drop off the gathering when I’m ready to leave. (What’s the “turn off video” equivalent for me when being at a large event? Probably peeling away with a person or two for the ol’ walk and talk.) Going forward, I think virtual events will continue to evolve beyond the Zoom room and into formats like Icebreaker. I can’t say that Covid-19 has made me rethink the personal utility of the really big conferences (I don’t attend many), but it does make me miss the curation of smaller groups. The events where hosts put effort into bringing together people with a high degree of purpose and work hard to ensure mixing, those are wonderful. My 2022 will hopefully include a return to events like these.\nWorking with founders\nThis is what I really have missed. You might think I’m referring to the time spent with a founder before deciding to make an investment in their startup, and certainly, there are moments where an in-person conversation can be the difference between Deal or No Deal. But I don’t think we’ll ever go back to 100% in-person pitching, especially in the earliest stages of getting to know someone. It’s just too mutually efficient to make a first pitch into a call or video, especially if the founders prefer it.\n\nWhat I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard.\n\n\n\n\nBut what I really do miss are the post-investment moments that are so much better in-person — the types of relationships that get built over meals, over walks, and on a whiteboard. Not the perfunctory showing up in person for a board meeting (although sometimes being there is important), but rather the stuff which requires as much EQ (or emotional intelligence) as IQ. And I’m anticipating doing a lot of this in the places our portfolio companies are scattered: the Bay Area, New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Toronto, Portland, San Diego, Boston, Salt Lake City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and so on.\nFor what it’s worth, I sense lots of startup teams are ready to get back into offices as well or at least have the flexibility to work in-person for the periods where collaboration and culture-building are most essential. If I were early in my career, it would absolutely be my preference to work for a company with an in-office culture (either full-time or hybrid). There’s just so much community and learning-by-osmosis (or serendipity) that comes from being together. So while our VC firm Homebrew definitely invests in companies that are 100% remote/distributed, we also espouse being intentional about what it means to do so and not underinvest in the infrastructure, travel, and skill-building it takes to succeed in this model.\nWork-life balance\nDo we still call it this? How about just happiness and sanity? I’ve found that I really enjoy driving my kid to school on Friday mornings. I’ve found that playing backgammon with my wife over lunch is nice when our mutual schedules accommodate. I’ve grown increasingly fond of just talking on the phone with a founder for five minutes when they need some help (versus going back and forth over email). Optimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain. My weekdays are basically 80% Homebrew, 20% family, with my weekends being the reverse. So far it’s worked out pretty well, except I think my dog is going to be shocked when we’re not in the house with her 24/7.\n\nOptimizing as best I can for flexibility has been a delight and a privilege, one I hope to maintain.\n\n\n\n\nHomebrew closed its office in San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood last March, and we’ve only been in there a handful of times since.

Effective KPIs help you understand if your product is creating the desired value for the users, the customers, and the business. Without KPIs, you end up guessing how well your product is performing. It’s like driving a car with your vision blurred: You can’t see if you are heading in the right direction or getting closer to your destination. You might have a hunch, but you don’t know if it is correct. Using KPIs and collecting the relevant data helps you balance intuition with empirical evidence. This increases the chances of making the right decisions and achieving product success.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Goal-directed Approach to Choosing KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, I recommend taking the following three steps: First, use the user and business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> to select an initial set of indicators. Then take into account the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> to discover additional KPIs. Finally, choose further indicators to assess the health of your product and team. This, of course, assumes that you have a validated product strategy and a realistic product roadmap in place. If that’s not the case, then I recommend creating those two plans first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I suggest using a goal-directed approach to identify the right indicators. I am not a big fan of “standard” KPIs, for example, customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and number of active users for SaaS products. While it’s helpful to be aware of the indicators that may be commonly used for the type of product you manage, it would be a mistake to blindly adopt them. Employing user, business, and product goals to guide the selection of KPIs avoids this mistake and it ensures that your indicators are relevant and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Take Advantage of the Product’s User and Business Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To select the right KPIs, start with the needs and the business goals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a>. Then consider how you can tell if they have been met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want to offer a product that <em>reduces the blood sugar levels of individuals who have type-2 diabetes </em>and that <em>generates £50k of revenue within the first 12 months of launching the app</em>. I would then ask myself how I can measure that the product creates the desired user and business value. To determine the former, I might choose user feedback, net promoter score (NPS), and referral rate as the key performance indicators. To understand the latter, I might select monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach assumes that valid user and business goals are available. In other words, the goals should be part of a validated product strategy—a strategy whose key assumptions and risks have been successfully addressed. This might have involved observing target users, interviewing them, carrying out competitor research, and using throw-away prototypes, to name just a few <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">strategy validation techniques</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Use Product Goals to Discover Additional KPIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to deriving KPIs from the user and business goals, I like to use the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">product goals</a> I have captured on the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a> in order to discover additional indicators. A product goal is a specific and measurable benefit or outcome your product should achieve, typically in the next two to three months. What’s more, every product goal should be aligned with the user and business goals in the product strategy, as I explain in more detail in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16840\">Product Goals in Scrum</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say the goal of my initial product (MVP) is to <em>allow the users to better understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base</em>. I would then look at the first part of this goal and ask myself if I need to introduce a new indicator. As I’ve already chosen <em>user feedback</em>, <em>net promoter score</em>, and <em>referral rate</em>, I would not add another metric at this stage. But the second part, <em>acquire an initial user base</em>, would require the introduction of a new KPI in order to understand if the acquisition goal has been met. To do so, I might measure market share, for instance, by tracking the product’s position in the appropriate app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Add Health Indicators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring how well your product is doing at meeting its user, business, and product goals is great. But it is not enough. Let’s say that my new product is meeting its revenue targets, that the user feedback is excellent, and that NPS and referral rates are high. This suggests that it is performing well, and there seems to be no reason to worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the team motivation is declining—as people are being overworked or stressed—or if the code quality is deteriorating—as bugs are accumulating and the code complexity is increasing, alarm bells should go off. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future, due to an increase in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/technical-debt-and-product-success/\">technical debt</a>, higher absenteeism or turnover rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore helpful to add metrics that measure how healthy your product and team are and that allow you to spot important warning signs early on so you can be proactive and respond to them in a timely manner—instead of reacting to them with the back against the wall. These indicators include product quality, schedule variances, which is the ability to meet product goals on time and budget, team motivation, team knowledge and skills, and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less is More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having been involved in product management for 20 years, I sometimes marvel at how much our profession has changed for the better.

Misinformation, trolling, harassment, polarization, and the resulting negative implications — none of these are as simple to define as CTR or CPM. I myself fell victim to this during my time leading the consumer product team at YouTube. When Google leadership asked us to shift from focusing solely on user growth to also increasing monetization, the team we destaffed to fund the new effort had been working on the comments system. Yup, YouTube comments, which most often resulted in a lot of name-calling, profanity, and worse. We all wanted it to improve, but why did I sacrifice this project in the near term?

It’s not crazy to wonder this, and while I don’t believe that it’s a true correlation or that our social platforms are intentionally running at the efficient frontier of anger and profits, I do always wonder what <a href=\"https://hunterwalk.medium.com/is-the-quest-for-software-margins-to-blame-for-twitters-trolls-facebook-s-russians-and-1ef0bef605bc\">margin pressure</a> does to, say, adequate investment in trust and safety.<br><br>Casey Newton’s <em>Platformer</em> article about <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/facebooks-ai-reckoning?r=2c7b&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy\">Facebook’s Responsible A.I. team</a> provoked a combination of eagerness and skepticism. My fear is that even if these teams are actually equipped to study and challenge internally held beliefs about their products, they will be forbidden from making changes that negatively impact business metrics. That is to say, we want responsibility but only when it doesn’t put the stock price at risk. I say this not just (or specifically) about Facebook, but more generally about the complexity of incentives within a corporation.

While much of Silicon Valley was already curtailing travel and starting to work from home, zeitgeist watchers note a perfect storm of the NBA suspending their season, Tom Hanks being diagnosed as positive, WHO declaring a global pandemic and He Which Shall Not Be Named implementing a travel ban (actually a good idea) as the starting point for “this isn’t just the flu.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading&nbsp;Maya Kosoff’s ‘<a href=\"https://kosoff.medium.com/i-always-knew-2020-was-going-to-be-a-lost-year-8889807949bf\">Lost Year</a>’ essay as part of Medium’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/tag/pandemic-reflections\">Pandemic Reflections</a>&nbsp;made me consider my own past 12 months. Because of my love for this thing we call the World Wide Web, I’m going to do my own reminiscing via Five Links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID Tracking Project</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An oasis in a misinformation desert, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/\">COVID Tracking Project&nbsp;</a>started very ad hoc but was always authoritative and reliable in trying to understand the illness’ spread. Good data helped put so much in perspective: that this thing was running wild, that it was disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and geographies and that outside of vaccines, the spread *could* be managed via safety practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the numbers got larger and we almost numbed to the milestones, I stopped focusing on the quantitative and transitioned to the qualitative, namely how to emotionally support my family and my community. The COVID Tracking Project will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/covid-tracking-project-end-march-7\">discontinue updating</a>&nbsp;on its first anniversary (March 7, 2021) but it was one of the URLs that defined my first year of COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Casey Newton &amp; I Got&nbsp;Zoombombed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on this whole WFH thing was kinda silly and fun in the tech industry.

I got to say things like “I’ve never ordered so much Goldbelly!” while others lost paychecks and family members. My friend Nikhil summarized so many of my thoughts in his essay&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nbt.substack.com/p/a-widening-gap\">A Widening Gap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A widening gap. A gap between the “haves” and the “have nots,” between those with disposable income and those that don’t have jobs.&nbsp;A gap between fact and fiction, between those that have access to the truth and those that are fed lies non-stop. A gap that’s been exacerbated by the pandemic, certainly, but also by the forces of technology, media, and politics, not just in the last four years, but for the past decade.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It will take considerable work, across technology, media, and government, to reverse this course. There isn’t a simple solution that will be the&nbsp;</em>next big thing<em>&nbsp;in 2021; instead, it’s going to take years of effort.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I appreciate about Nikhil’s blog post was that it’s not just about tech’ing our way out of this dynamic, but about empathy, caring and even some sacrifice. “Do Things That Don’t Scale” is classic startup advice and I feel the same way about the beginnings of what it takes to reverse these inequality dynamics. Beyond structural change, if we each just cared for a handful of other people in a way that extended beyond our immediate circles, we’d make so much progress. It’s why I love direct action nonprofits such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://detroitwaterproject.org/\">Human Utility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Virtual Drinking Buddies</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years when people asked what my hobbies were I’d kind of shrug my shoulders. There were activities I enjoyed (movies! friends! work!) but nothing that I’d consider a ‘hobby.’&nbsp;Maybe I’d been overly influenced by the people around me who, when they pursued something, did so with a focus that turned “jogging” into “complete marathons on all continents” and “cooking” into “I’m spending the summer in France as an apprentice pastry baker.”&nbsp;If a hobby equated to something you spent too much time and money on, then my only hobby was therapy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’d gotten tired of not having an answer and started telling folks my hobbies were&nbsp;coffee and notebooks (the paper note-taking kind).&nbsp;These were honest answers as I do enjoy researching, purchasing and consuming both of these, but there’s only so far you can go with notebooks and on the coffee front, I cared more about good beans than necessarily experimenting with every prep method, which meant the subreddits were a bit too much for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-forward to the beginning of 2020 and the whiplash we all experienced with travel stopping, restaurants closing and our homes becoming work, play, live 24/7. We’ve all adopted new coping mechanisms and found new aspects to our relationships. Some even used the time to reconsider where they work or move to new cities. Me?&nbsp;I got into whiskey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before sharing more I want to acknowledge that alcohol as a “hobby” can be jarring for many. People close to me have dealt with various addictions, including alcohol, and many more have removed it from their lifestyle in the interest of health, mental clarity and other benefits. Fortunately I’m not prone to over-consumption and my interest has been as much about the history, business and people around the spirit as actual consumption (I’m basically a 1–4 oz type of guy — for reference, the average 750ml bottle is roughly 25 ounces).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d previously been whiskey-curious, buying a bottle every now and then, trying different bourbons in a bar and so on. But about a year ago I joined a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SFWhiskies/\">local Bay Area whiskey group</a>&nbsp;that I’ve enjoyed learning from, sharing with and doing virtual tastings.

While much of Silicon Valley was already curtailing travel and starting to work from home, zeitgeist watchers note a perfect storm of the NBA suspending their season, Tom Hanks being diagnosed as positive, WHO declaring a global pandemic and He Which Shall Not Be Named implementing a travel ban (actually a good idea) as the starting point for “this isn’t just the flu.”\nReading Maya Kosoff’s ‘Lost Year’ essay as part of Medium’s Pandemic Reflections made me consider my own past 12 months. Because of my love for this thing we call the World Wide Web, I’m going to do my own reminiscing via Five Links.\nThe COVID Tracking Project\nAn oasis in a misinformation desert, the COVID Tracking Project started very ad hoc but was always authoritative and reliable in trying to understand the illness’ spread. Good data helped put so much in perspective: that this thing was running wild, that it was disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and geographies and that outside of vaccines, the spread *could* be managed via safety practices.\nAs the numbers got larger and we almost numbed to the milestones, I stopped focusing on the quantitative and transitioned to the qualitative, namely how to emotionally support my family and my community. The COVID Tracking Project will discontinue updating on its first anniversary (March 7, 2021) but it was one of the URLs that defined my first year of COVID.\nWhen Casey Newton & I Got Zoombombed\nEarly on this whole WFH thing was kinda silly and fun in the tech industry.

Scrum is a simple framework designed to facilitate the development of complex products. It does not intend to prescribe how the practices it offers should be applied.

Some view it as the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8590\">product vision</a>, others equate it to the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">value proposition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find, however, that a product goal is best used to describe a <em>specific and measurable benefit or outcome</em> a product should create in the course of the next <em>two to six months</em>. A sample goal might be to acquire users, increase conversion, generate revenue, or reduce technical debt. Such a goal aligns the stakeholders and development teams, and it directs their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, I like to ensure that product goals are <em>connected to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a></em> and its user and business goals. This helps me choose the right product goals and it ensures that meeting a product goal is a step towards creating the desired value for the users and the business, as figure 1 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16846\" width=\"482\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals.png 993w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-300x252.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Romans-cascading-goals-768x644.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The Product Goal in Context</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the vision is the basis for choosing the user and business goals, and the latter create the context for determining the right product goal.

When I started to work with Scrum in 2004, I could not get my head around the question of how to systematically connect a big, inspiring vision to a tactical, short-term sprint goal. It took me years to come up with the set of goals in figure 1. In hindsight, the set looks disappointingly simple <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the contents of this article on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my YouTube Channel</a>:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Product Goals In Scrum\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0NWukbHkDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sample Goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand how the goals in figure 1 can be applied, let’s take a look at an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16847\" width=\"491\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-1024x808.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-300x237.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-goals-768x606.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Sample Goals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 2, I first captured the vision “Help people eat healthily” and then used it to choose the user and business goals “Reduce the risk of developing type-two diabetes; create new revenue source.” In order to determine the right product goal, I asked myself, “What would be a first good step to meet the from the user and business goal?” I consequently chose the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.” I then used this goal to determine the right sprint goal. I figured that finding out if users are willing to share personal information when activating the app would be the most important risk to address and hence should be the goal of the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I chose to use a <em>compound product goal</em> in figure 2 that has a user part—help the users understand their eating habits and business—and a business one—acquire an initial user base. Both parts are closely connected: In order to acquire a user base, the product must offer tangible value to the users, and a first step to help people eat more healthily is to help them become aware of their current eating habits. You don’t have to work with compound product goals of course, if you prefer to focus your objectives on either the user or the business benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Roadmap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting a single product goal is great. But unless you can’t see further than the next few months, I recommend determining the next three to four product goals and capturing them on your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, as figure 3 below shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16848\" width=\"569\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-1024x673.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-300x197.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals-768x505.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sample-GO-roadmap-with-product-goals.png 1197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Sample GO Product Roadmap with Product Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 3 shows a sample roadmap based on my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/the-go-product-roadmap/\">GO product roadmap template</a>, which contains three product goals. Each goal builds on the previous one thereby nicely progressing the product: The first goal helps the users become aware of their eating habits and creates and initial user base. The second one helps people improve their eating habits and acquires additional users. The third product goal, finally, helps the users improve their overall fitness and generates revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Scrum Guide does not mention identifying future product goals and adding them to the product roadmap, I find this practice very helpful: Stakeholders and dev teams usually benefit from understanding how to product is likely to evolve beyond the next two to three months. This helps the individuals create an effective sales and marketing strategy, for example, and to make the right architecture and technology decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Goals and the Product Backlog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a product roadmap in place, I like to select the product goal to be worked on and copy it from the roadmap to the product backlog together with any coarse-grained features that are associated with the goal. This approach is illustrated by figure 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16849\" width=\"570\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-1024x276.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-300x81.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog-768x207.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-goals-and-product-backlog.png 1187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Product Goal and Product Backlog</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of using a product goal in the backlog is that it focuses the latter, as I describe in my article “<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">The Product Roadmap and the Product Backlog</a>.” This addresses a common issue: Many product backlogs I have seen over the years were too big and too detailed. This made them hard to prioritise and difficult to update, which is bad news as long as your product is young or experiences more than small, incremental changes. In most cases, the product backlogs grew so big because they lacked a measure to decide which items should be added to the backlog and which should not. The product goal is this measure: <em>Only add an item to the product backlog if it helps meet the product goal</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s briefly explore how a product goal might be used on the product backlog. Say I was to start the development of my healthy eating product, I would copy the product goal “Help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base” into the product backlog together with the features “healthy eating dashboard” and “integration with smart watches and fitness devices.” I’d ask myself which additional features are required to meet the product goal and add these to the backlog. I would the start breaking some of the features into <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/epics-and-ready-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4012\">epics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-the-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"538\">prioritise the product backlog</a>. Finally, I’d refine the high-priority items to be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready</a> to start the first sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can tell, I like product goals and find them very helpful, and I would encourage you to try them out if you haven’t used them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-goals-in-scrum/\">Product Goals in Scrum</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Product Goals Defined\nThe Scrum Guide released in November 2020 states that “the product goal describes a future state of the product … [It] is the long-term objective for the Scrum team.” It also suggests that “the product goal is in the product backlog.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”</h3><p>(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up <a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/\">here</a>.)</p><p>Given rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.</p><p>To answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Seek high-growth companies.</strong> These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.</li><li><strong>Build your network of peers and mentors.</strong> These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.</li><li><strong>Be ready to learn and unlearn.</strong> One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.</li><li><strong>Working with humans is hard! </strong>Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.</li></ol><p>Below, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.</p><h3>1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)</h3><p>Trip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.</p><p>Early at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:</p><ol><li><strong>How to ship a product on time.</strong> Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.</li><li><strong>How to deal with imposter syndrome.</strong> Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”</li></ol><p>Electronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.</p><p>In my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:</p><ol><li>Here’s what you did well</li><li>Here’s what you could have done better.</li></ol><p>My mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.</p><h3>1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)</h3><p>Greg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:</p><ol><li><strong>Greg forced me out of the building to connect with peers.</strong> He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.</li><li><strong>Greg helped me to transition into a formal leader.</strong> I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.</li></ol><p>Louis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:</p><ol><li><strong>How to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively.</strong> You can read my “<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/branding-for-builders-19e103ef3f1d\">Branding for Builders</a>” essay to learn more.</li><li><strong>How to form successful work relationships.</strong> Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:</li></ol><ul><li>Form (get to know each other to build trust)</li><li>Storm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)</li><li>Norm (develop shared ideas and approaches)</li><li>Perform (based on shared ideas and process)</li></ul><p>I learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.</p><p>Last, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.</p><p>Upon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.</p><h3>The Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)</h3><p>The Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)</p><p>My leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”</p><p>He answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”</p><p>I laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”</p><p>The reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.</p><p>My biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.</p><h3>1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company</h3><p>After two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:</p><blockquote><em>“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we </em>finally<em> talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”</em></blockquote><p>Jonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.</p><p>That week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.</p><h3>2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup</h3><p>Keith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.</p><h3>2005: Netflix</h3><p>When I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:</p><ol><li>“Can you delight customers?”</li><li>“Can you do consumer science?”</li></ol><p>I answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:</p><ol><li><strong>Delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways.</strong> I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (<a href=\"https://gibsonbiddle.medium.com/intro-to-product-strategy-60bdf72b17e3\">Here’s</a> my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)</li><li><strong>The power of simplicity.</strong> One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.</li><li><strong>The balancing act of qualitative and quantitative.</strong> In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.</li><li><strong>The downside of management.</strong> Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.</li><li><strong>I learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business</strong>. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes.

But mainly, I learned by doing, supercharged by feedback from many “Friends of Gib.”\n(Note: This essay is from my free “Ask Gib” newsletter on Substack, where I answer a few product and leadership questions each week. You can sign up here.)\nGiven rapid changes in product management roles and technologies, most of my learning has come from bosses and peers.\nTo answer this question, I created a list of learning from my thirty-year career. The list reinforces how product leaders can accelerate both their learning and career growth:\n\nSeek high-growth companies. These companies attract talent from whom you learn, plus provide the opportunity for fast-paced, battlefront promotions.\nBuild your network of peers and mentors. These individuals provide targeted learning opportunities. You can’t get the same degree of insight via reading or courses.\nBe ready to learn and unlearn. One decade, I discovered waterfall development. The next, I embraced agile.\nWorking with humans is hard! Learning to work effectively with engineers, designers, data scientists, project managers, researchers, marketers, customer success peeps, and CEOs is half the challenge of a product leader career.\n\nBelow, I catalog my learning over thirty years. I hope some of these nuggets will help you to avoid some of the mistakes I made.\n1991: Electronic Arts (an entertainment SW company)\nTrip Hawkins, the CEO and Founder of EA, interviewed me for my first product management role. Trip did a “day in the life” interview, asking me to role-play various scenarios. At the end of the interview, he evaluated me against EA’s six values. That’s when I learned how important it is to define and assess culture fit at high-growth companies.\nEarly at EA, Hal Jordy, an experienced game producer, helped me with two things:\n\nHow to ship a product on time. Hal’s insight: It’s too hard to predict the balancing act of time, quality, and money, so develop multiple products in parallel so you can swap in one product for another. Hal helped me to move from sequential to parallel development.\nHow to deal with imposter syndrome. Hal was with me one day when Stewart Bonn, the VP of Product, asked me a question. I got tongue-tied. Hal’s coaching: “Answer the question, Gib. And if you don’t have an answer, ask questions until you can form an opinion.”\n\nElectronic Arts also hosted a Producer College, which taught me the primary product and leadership skills required of product managers. Later, I learned how to teach these skills. For me, teaching has been one of the most effective tactics for learning new skills. Nothing forces an understanding of a topic more than having to teach it.\nIn my first six months at EA, I pissed off a few folks as I gave harsh feedback. My manager, Diane Flynn, sent me to “charm school.” There, I learned how to spend more time listening and giving balanced feedback:\n\nHere’s what you did well\nHere’s what you could have done better.\n\nMy mistake when I first started at EA? I gave critical feedback first instead of second. Oops.\n1994: Creative Wonders (an educational software startup)\nGreg Bestick was the CEO of my first startup, Creative Wonders. He was my boss’s boss, but later I worked for him when I became VP of Product. I learned three highly impactful things from him:\n\nGreg forced me out of the building to connect with peers. He felt this was the fastest way for me to learn. Over the years, I refined this concept to build a “Personal Board of Directors” composed of peers and mentors.\nGreg helped me to transition into a formal leader. I shipped lots of successful software and embodied Creative Wonders’ culture, but the exec team didn’t trust me. Why not? I was an iconoclast — I wore shorts and flip-flops to work and had little respect for authority. Greg told me to dress better and to go to lunch with each member of the exec team so they could get to know me as a person. Two months later, I became VP of Product. The lesson: leadership is symbolic and subtle cues like what you wear matter.\n\nLouis Roitlblat was my marketing partner at Creative Wonders. He taught me:\n\nHow to think about brand and positioning, and how marketing and product organizations can work together effectively. You can read my “Branding for Builders” essay to learn more.\nHow to form successful work relationships. Louis noticed I became impatient when starting new relationships. I didn’t take the time to build trust. He pointed out that I skipped the first of four steps in building a relationship:\n\nForm (get to know each other to build trust)\nStorm (Begin to challenge each other’s ideas)\nNorm (develop shared ideas and approaches)\nPerform (based on shared ideas and process)\n\nI learned to be patient in the “forming” stage to let folks get to know me before I challenged their thinking in the second “storming” phase. It took me decades to get reasonably good at this. I still screw up occasionally.\nLast, Tim Jenkins, our VP of Finance, helped me understand the children’s software business’s reality. We broke down the COGS model, distribution costs, marketing fees, development fees, royalties to brand holders (Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Madeline, etc.). It became clear that the challenge was to deliver as much value as possible within a $300,000 product development budget. In 1995, most of the children’s software development community consequently referred to me as “$300,000 Biddle,” which, even at the time, was an absurdly low budget.\nUpon reflection, my time at Creative Wonders as VP of Product taught me that my job was no longer solely focused on building products. It now required that I partner effectively with my marketing, finance, and sales peers. Before I was promoted, I would say stupid stuff like, “I don’t know what the hell finance is thinking when they propose these low-ball budgets!” But as I transitioned into a VP role, I realized how critical it was for me to build strong cross-functional alignment. At that point, I finally stopped “shit-stirring” across the different functions.\nThe Learning Company 1997 (Reader Rabbit, Oregon Trail)\nThe Learning Company bought Creative Wonders. Six months after the acquisition, I received a battlefront promotion to SVP of Product for TLC. (“Battlefront promotion” defined: When your boss leaves and you’re the last man/woman standing and the company makes a bet on you to fill the role quickly.)\nMy leadership learning accelerated. One of my first lessons was the extent to which a leader’s words carry. One evening I walked into a product manager’s cube to ask what he was doing. He threw a jacket over his Apple computer in an attempt to hide it. I asked him, “Why did you do that?”\nHe answered, “I heard you hated Macs and wanted to get rid of them.”\nI laughed, then remembered the Quarterly Product Strategy Meeting where I had said, “I hate Macs.”\nThe reason? At the time, about 95% of our revenues came from Windows, and only 5% came from the Mac. But the Mac version consumed lots of resources and inevitably delayed the Windows launch, given they were hybrid CD-ROMs. But I didn’t want to get rid of all the Macs in the building! After that, I chose my words more carefully.\nMy biggest lesson from The Learning Company: the importance of building hard to copy advantage. We had created lots of children’s software, grew through acquisition, then sold the company to Mattel for $4B. But two years later, Mattel divested The Learning Company and took a $3.6B write-down, making the acquisition one of the worst in history. TLC had built a large category of children’s educational software, but competitors copied our work, and the children’s software category became a commodity. Today, I emphasize building a hard-to-copy advantage through brand, unique technologies, network effects, and economies of scale.\n1999: FamilyWonder, a family-focused e-commerce company\nAfter two years at this startup, Jonathan Kaplan, the CEO, took me aside to explain:\n“Gib, we are going to visit Sega of Japan for a week — they want to buy us. For the first five days, we won’t talk about business. We’ll eat, drink, and do Karaoki. On the last two days, when we finally talk business, I need you to be comfortable with long silences — listen carefully. Don’t feel compelled to jump in.”\nJonathan knew some of my patterns and coached me appropriately. He also anticipated some of the challenges I would have navigating cultural differences in Japan.\nThat week in Japan, I took copious notes to force myself to listen and avoid talking too much. At the end of the week, we closed the deal.\n2003: Epoch Innovations, a dyslexia technology startup\nKeith Rabois was C.O.O at Epoch Innovations. He had just left Paypal after its $1.5B acquisition by eBay. When he looked at the design for our new website, he told me, “I don’t care what the website looks like. I want to see the data.” Keith was the catalyst for my growing focus on quantitative data to understand how customers behave v. what they say in usability or focus groups.\n2005: Netflix\nWhen I interviewed at Netflix for the VP Product role, Reed Hastings, the CEO, asked me two questions:\n\n“Can you delight customers?”\n“Can you do consumer science?”\n\nI answered “Yes” to both, but I learned a lot about applying the scientific method to product development at Netflix. I also learned how to delight customers while building long-term advantages. Here’s some of my key learning, primarily from Reed:\n\nDelight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. I learned this mantra from Reed, and it forms the basis of my product strategy frameworks. (Here’s my “How to Define Your Product Strategy” series on Medium.)\nThe power of simplicity. One year, Reed encouraged me to focus on simplifying our product. While most product leaders like to build and add, we focused on streamlining the experience. This focus helped us to create a product that 200 million worldwide members can readily embrace today.\nThe balancing act of qualitative and quantitative. In my first year at Netflix, Reed and I debated the merit of qualitative (focus groups, usability) v. AB testing. After a year, we reached a truce where I continued to use qualitative as a source for new ideas and understand the “why” of customer behavior. But I relied on AB test results to decide whether to launch a new feature or not.\nThe downside of management. Reed described me as “the best manager in the building.” But he said it critically—his point: too much management squeezes the life out of innovation. I learned instead to provide discipline through strategy and consumer science.\nI learned how culture helps talented individuals make great decisions about people, products, and business. For me, culture became an influential “anti-process.” Talented individuals don’t like rules or processes. The Netflix culture — its articulation of the values, skills, and behaviors desired for all employees — enabled individuals to make significant decisions without even talking to one another.\n\nLeslie Kilgore ran Marketing at Netflix. While Reed was “all in” on AB testing, Leslie helped me form the customer’s voice in my head through qualitative. Her coaching:\n\nGet outside Silicon Valley. We moved beyond “Silicon Valley Freaks” to find “normal” customers in Providence, Memphis, and Denver, among other cities.\nGet to the “why” through qualitative. Leslie often had a live video feed of focus groups playing in her cube. In a building full of “quant jocks,” it was helpful to get insight into the “why” of customer behavior by listening to our members in focus groups and usability. Leslie was an effective counter-voice to Reed.\nTest big changes. We did lots of testing of our non-member site — our site’s front door. One day Leslie looked down at a print-out of six versions going into the next AB test. In looking at the postage-stamp-sized designs, she struggled to see the differences. She remarked, “If we can’t see the deltas in each version, our customers will never notice them. Our members are way too busy to detect nuance.”\nThe dance between marketing and product. Sometimes we’d test a hypothesis for a new feature on the non-member homepage to see if it improved conversion, and if it did, we’d build the feature. In other cases, the product evolved, and we’d bring attention to a new feature on the non-member homepage later. This “Tango” between product development and marketing continued forever.\n\nThe last person at Netflix who fundamentally influenced my thinking is Patty McCord, the Chief People Officer. She helped me to solve many “people problems” in a highly leveraged way. Her advice:\nWhen presented with a problem from an employee, ask the following question: “When you talked to this person about the issue, what did he or she say.”\nIn 80% of the cases, the person would go back, talk to the other person, and solve the problem independently.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Agile Has Changed Product Management\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDjkQxXw-2U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Brave New Agile World</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-working-development-team-for-product-managers-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10971\">collaborate much more closely</a>. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/think-product/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"553\">product-led approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early user feedback, frequent solution validation</strong>: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/beyond-product-demo-validation-techniques-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7876\">validate our ideas</a> and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced time-to-market</strong>: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a> that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better product quality and improved adaptability</strong>: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better requirements</strong>: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-backlog-refinement-steps/\">dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work</a> and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparent development progress</strong>: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">The progress is now based on working software</a> rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved alignment</strong>: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">sprint reviews</a>. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">involving them in the process of making product decisions</a> increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivated productive teams</strong>: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Old and New Product Management Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist.

Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confusion about roles and responsibilities</strong>: Even 20 years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> was conceived, agile roles like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16306\">product owner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied.

The latter would work with one or more development teams to get the specification implemented.\nDuring the development phase, the product manager would be only loosely involved, typically attending a project steering meeting and possibly issuing change requests. Otherwise, the individual would hope that the requirements were implemented as specified. Only once the product was close to being finished would the product manager return to the project and prepare the release of the product.\nThis sequential, waterfall-based approach used to work when there was little change and innovation, when product managers could correctly predict what the users needed and describe the detailed product functionality upfront. But it is less suited to create complex digital products.\nYou can also access the content of this article on my YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brave New Agile World\nAs agile practices have become more widely adopted, the processes used to develop products have significantly changed: Product people and development teams now tend to collaborate much more closely. Dev teams have become cross-functional consisting of UX designers, architects, programmers, testers, and other roles. Products are developed using iterative-incremental processes like Scrum. Requirements are no longer detailed and frozen before development starts but they emerge. An increasing number of organisations have moved away from organising around projects and have started to embrace a product-led approach.\nEarly user feedback, frequent solution validation: We now have the ability to collect early and frequent user and customer feedback, which helps us validate our ideas and update our plans accordingly. This has increased the chances of creating a product with the right UX and the right features.\nReduced time-to-market: We can now release new products and features more quickly. This is enabled by a closer, ongoing collaboration with cross-functional development teams, shifting from written documentation to face-to-face conversations, and using techniques such as user stories that reduce overhead—when applied correctly.\nBetter product quality and improved adaptability: The quality of our products has improved through the application of agile development practices like emergent design, test-driven development, and continuous integration. This has allowed us to adapt the product more quickly and to respond to user feedback more easily.\nBetter requirements: As product people, we are no longer solely responsible for coming up with the correct requirements. Instead, the dev team members actively participate in the product backlog refinement work and help us identify the necessary changes and capture new product backlog items. This leverages the team members’ creativity and expertise, creates a shared understanding, fosters collective ownership, improves the quality of the requirements, and ultimately results in better products.\nTransparent development progress: We can see the development progress more clearly and make corrections early if required: The progress is now based on working software rather than a detailed, Gantt chart-based project plan. This mitigates the risk of discovering late that the product cannot be shipped on time or that some features were implemented incorrectly.\nImproved alignment: Stakeholders and development teams are now better aligned through the use of regular collaborative workshops like sprint reviews. This creates a shared understanding and leads to greater commitment: Asking people about their perspectives and involving them in the process of making product decisions increases the likelihood that the individuals will support the decisions.\nMotivated productive teams: Last but not least, self-organising development teams tend to be more motivated and productive compared to traditional ones, as they are able to determine themselves how much work can be done in a given period, decide who carries out a specific piece of work, and agree on how the team members collaborate.\nOld and New Product Management Challenges\nWhile agile methods have given us plenty of benefits, a number of product management challenges still persist. These were not caused by agile practices, as far as I can tell. Agile has made them more visible, though, and it has exacerbated some of them. Let’s look at the key challenges that remain.\nLack of empowerment: When coining the Scrum terms, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland chose the term product owner instead of product manager in order to emphasise the level of authority and empowerment a product person requires—especially in an agile context where collaboration is valued, and stakeholders and dev teams regularly contribute to product decisions.\nUnfortunately, a lack of empowerment is still a common issue: Product people often don’t have the necessary authority to make strategic product decision, shape the strategy, and own the roadmap. Consequently, they are in danger of playing a tactical product role and being product backlog managers and user story writers rather than owning the product in its entirety and being able to maximise the value it creates.\nConfusion about roles and responsibilities: Even 20 years after the Manifesto for Agile Software Development was conceived, agile roles like product owner and Scrum Master are not always clearly understood, let alone effectively applied. As indicated above, product owners are sometimes mistaken for product backlog managers and stakeholder pleasers instead of the individuals who are in charge of a product and whose decisions the entire organisation must respect, as the Scrum Guide puts it.\nLack of direct interaction with users and customers: Customer collaboration is one of the four values in the agile manifesto. Nevertheless, it’s not uncommon for me to meet product people who don’t have direct access to users and customers. Instead, they solely rely on quantitative data and feedback from sales, which makes it hard to empathise with the users and customers and to fully understand their needs. This, in turn, reduces the chances of offering a product that does a great job for its target audience and generates the desired business benefits.\nProduct discovery and product strategy poorly practiced: The most beautiful user stories are useless if it’s not clear who the users are and why they would want to use the product. Acquiring this information requires focused product discovery and strategy work. Unfortunately, product discovery and strategy aren’t always effectively practiced. This is not helped by the fact that agile approaches like Scrum do not offer any tools and techniques to help product owners understand if a product should be developed. Fortunately, a number of tools and techniques have emerged in recent years that help product people with their product discovery and strategy work including my product vision board and GO product roadmap.\nLack of sustainable pace: “The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely,” states the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Ironically, working at a healthy, sustainable pace can be particularly challenging in an agile context: Product people have to regularly interact with development teams in order to update the product backlog, agree on sprint goals, answer questions, and provide feedback on product increments in addition to all the other product management duties. Being overworked, however, has a negative impact on our productivity and mental health. Luckily, there are a number of practical measures you can take to achieve sustainable pace. These include not covering other people jobs on a continued basis—like acting as a stand-in Scrum Master—and having the courage to decline stakeholder requests. Please see my article “Sustainable Pace in Product Management” for more guidance.\nLooking into the Crystal Ball\nSo where do we go from here? How will product management change over the next 20 years, and which role will agile methods play—if any?\nWithout having a crystal ball at my disposal, I believe that the future of product management will be shaped by our ability to address the product management challenges mentioned above. I sincerely hope that in 20 years from now, empowerment will no longer be a significant issue, product roles will be better understood and more effectively applied, and product discovery and strategy will always be practiced by anybody who manages or owns a product.

The dev team is struggling with the current workload, and moving the date is not an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, you suspect that John’s request may be motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets. But John is a well-connected and influential individual who doesn’t like to be told that he is wrong. How can you decline his request without offending him and losing his support?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can also access the content of this article on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGzudy5AKhypVYdSlaSrCA\">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DB0ggAe7ApA?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.romanpichler.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Feel Bad about Saying<strong> </strong>No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Declining a request can be hard. You might not want to disappoint John in the example above, you might worry that saying no will anger him and lead to conflict, or you might not want to be seen as a naysayer but somebody who has a can-do attitude and wants to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying no, however, is part and parcel of a product person’s job. If you said yes to every idea and request, you would end up with a <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adrenaline-Junkies-Template-Zombies-Understanding/dp/0932633676/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">feature soup</a></em>, a product with an uncompelling value proposition and a poor user experience. As Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things. You have to pick carefully.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe, however, that it would be impossible for you to say no to John, then this may indicate that you are not properly empowered, that you lack the authority and respect required to be in charge of the product and be responsible for its success. If that’s the case, explore how you can strengthen your product leadership. Refer to my article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a>&#8221; for more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empathise with the Stakeholder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having decided that you can’t accept John’s request, you might be tempted to share your view with the individual and say, for instance: “Sorry, John. But there is no way that I can add the feature to the current release. The development team is struggling to implement the agreed features, and, as you know, we can’t push out the date.” This might seem like a reasonable answer: It’s direct and it offers an explanation. But would it be effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If John does not feel heard and understood, it will be hard for him to accept no as an answer, no matter how valid your arguments are. Instead, he might feel rejected and react with disappointment or anger. He might think that you don’t appreciate his views and don’t care about his needs. Consequently, John may no longer fully trust and support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this situation and maximise the chances that John can receive a no, empathise with the individual before you offer an answer. Find out why the feature is important to John. What is his personal, vested interest in getting the feature included in the release? Why does it matter to him? Only if John feels understood will he open up to your perspective, listen to your arguments, and accept that you can’t add the feature to the release. The following <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/listen-to-understand-listening-practices-for-product-people/\">listening techniques</a> will help you with this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give your full attention to the individual. Maintain eye contact and show the person that you are interested in what she or he has to say.</li><li>Keep an <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/growth-mindset-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14188\">open mind</a> even if you disagree with what you are hearing or if you dislike the individual. Listen with the intention to understand, not to answer. John might be right, after all, and you should add the feature to the release.</li><li>Pay attention to the person’s body language. Non-verbal information—like voice pitch and volume, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movement—expresses the speaker’s feelings, which help you uncover the individual’s underlying interests.</li><li>Ask clarifying and probing questions to check that you have correctly understood what was said and encourage the other person to provide more information. You might say, for instance, “Can you please help me understand why adding the feature is important to you?”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reframe the Conversati<strong>on</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">Stakeholders</a> often request specific features without necessarily being fully aware of the problem it addresses. But value is hardly created by adding a single piece of functionality—at least as long as a product is young or changing. Instead of debating an individual feature with John, reframe the conversation. Explore which user or customer problem the functionality would help address. How would implementing the feature benefit these individuals? Why do some customers view it as crucial, to stay with the example above? And would there be an alternative way to achieve the desired impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if the feature is aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goal</a> of the current development effort, the outcome you want to achieve, for example, to enter a new market or to increase engagement. Will addressing the user problem help you meet this goal and create the desired benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then you should consider adapting the development effort. You may decide to add the feature to the release, assuming that you make appropriate adjustments like reducing or removing other features or moving the delivery date. But if the answer is no, then you should decline the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Rush the Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be tempting to quickly make a decision just to be done with it. While you don’t want to procrastinate the decision, rushing it is usually a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say that the conversation with John has turned difficult. He is adamant that the feature must be added, and he doesn’t want to accept your view. What’s more, he suggests that you don’t understand what the customers want, and he threatens to escalate the issue if you decline his request. In such a situation, it’s natural to feel difficult emotions like confusion, worry, and anger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, it’s best to pause the conversation and to postpone the decision to regain a cool head and allow the difficult feelings to subside. You might say to John, “It’s really important to me that we find a good solution. But I am feeling upset right now, and I need some time to reflect on what I heard you say. Let’s please continue the conversation in the afternoon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, consider if you can and should make the decision on your own. If the decision has a bigger impact, if you require other people’s input to make the right decision, or if you want to secure their buy-in, I recommend scheduling a meeting with all the key stakeholders and the development team representatives in order to discuss and evaluate the feature request and make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">joint decision</a>. You might even find that you need to run an experiment and collect relevant data, for instance, by interviewing users or releasing a feature fake, before you can make the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try to Find Common Ground, but Don’t Split the Difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While saying no is sometimes unavoidable, I recommend that you explore if there is an alternative way to meet the stakeholder’s underlying need. Say that your suspicion turned out to be right: John’s request is, at least partly, motivated by the desire to meet his sales targets and claim a bonus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, find out if you can help him achieve his goal without having to add the feature—assuming that you believe that it is right for you to help John pursue this goal. Would it be helpful, for example, to develop a sales pitch that shows that the product addresses some of the customer needs without providing the extra feature? Or is there another solution you can develop together with John?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t make the mistake, though, to simply split the difference and suggest to John that you will partially implement the feature as part of the current release—unless this would actually meet John’s underlying need and not sacrifice sustainable pace for the development team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do what is necessary to maximise the value your product creates but don’t attempt to please individual stakeholders. Be kind and firm. Remember: Successful products are not built on weak compromises or the smallest common denominator.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-saying-no-to-stakeholders/\">5 Tips for Saying No to Stakeholders</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Imagine that you are talking to John, a senior salesperson who’s been involved with the product for a while.

cancel rate from 10% to 2%. They did this by balancing delight against margin (profit) while building a durable, hard-to-copy advantage. I call it the <strong>DHM</strong> model: <strong>D</strong>elight customers in <strong>H</strong>ard-to-copy, <strong>M</strong>argin-enhancing ways.</p><p>Today, Netflix’s hard-to-copy attributes are:</p><ul><li>unique technology (personalization, streaming encoding)</li><li>network effects (a large device ecosystem)</li><li>economies of scale (a $20B annual content spend), and a</li><li>trusted brand</li></ul><p>A challenge along the way: How do you evaluate trade-offs between delight and margin? When might you choose to lose money to delight customers?</p><p>Below, I answer both of these questions using two Netflix cases, using directional data.</p><p><strong>2005: The Perfect New Release Experiment</strong></p><p>In 2005, Netflix had one million members in its nascent DVD-by-mail service. The most frequent customer request? Faster new release DVD delivery. The challenge: three months after a movie appeared in theaters, Studios released the DVD version — and as soon as that DVD version dropped, lots of customers wanted it immediately. Within a few months, however, demand decreased as the novelty wore off.</p><p>Rather than buying up a surplus of newly released DVDs to handle that short-term spike in demand, we decided to optimize for the long-term. As a result, during the first few months after a DVD launch, some customers had to wait a week or two to get the new release. If the new release wasn’t available when the customer requested it, we shipped the next movie on the customer’s movie list, then sent the new release when it became available.</p><p>In response to customer requests for faster DVD delivery, we designed a “perfect new release” A/B test and allocated 10,000 customers to the test cell. These customers received their new release DVDs the next day, while customers in the control cell waited for weeks or months to get their new releases. Our delight metric? Retention.</p><p>The questions we hoped to answer:</p><ul><li>Will faster new release DVD delivery improve retention, and, if so, by how much? (At the time, roughly 4.5% of our customers canceled each month).</li><li>If this experience improves retention, is it worth spending more money on DVD inventory? How much more?</li></ul><p>The answer: Yes, faster new release delivery improved retention, but by much less than we expected. The monthly cancel rate improved by about 0.05% — from 4.50% to 4.45%. So, was it worth spending more money on the new release DVD inventory?</p><p>Here’s how we evaluated the balance between delight and margin:</p><ul><li>If we rolled out this “perfect new release” experience to all members, we’d save 5,000 customers/year. (One million subscribers x .05 retention improvement = 5,000 saved customers).</li><li>We believed happier customers would rave about the service, attracting new members via word of mouth, so we doubled the number of saved customers. We estimated that each “saved” customer would attract one new member to the service.</li><li>The value of this perfect new release experience was $1 million: 5,000 saved customers x $100 (the lifetime value of a customer) X 2 for the WOM factor.</li></ul><p>But the cost to deliver that perfect new release experience was $5 million in additional DVD inventory. Given the potential gain of $1 million against a $5M spend, we chose not to roll the feature out to all members.</p><p>What we learned:</p><ol><li>What customers say doesn’t always match their behavior. You need A/B testing to measure behavior change.</li><li>It’s helpful to understand how much customers value different features. We invested in things our members valued (broader DVD selection, lower prices, next-day DVD delivery). We invested less in features they didn’t value (new release DVDs, social, unique movie-finding tools).</li></ol><p>We never established a more precise word-of-mouth factor, though I’ve heard that Amazon sometimes uses an 8X factor. A large WOM multiple encourages more investment in customer delight, but at the time, we couldn’t afford to spend $5 million for a marginal retention improvement.</p><p><strong>2016: The Free Trial Reminder Experiment</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fTpYyZM_pvOCBX6V\" /></figure><p>Netflix’s non-member page is the store window for the service.

When do I use this knife?”\nThese five-percenters gunk up the experience and make it harder to use. And zillions of edge cases start popping up: “Hey! Why can’t I use “Party” on devices other than my laptop?!” or “How do I execute “Party” using voice on an Amazon Show device?”\nNot All Good Ideas Benefit the Brand\nWhy won’t Netflix party? For more than two decades, Netflix has been building a product that delivers on the brand promise “Movie Enjoyment Made Easy.”\nThink for a moment about the experience of forming a Netflix Party. First, you need to choose a movie everyone likes. Then, you agree on a time to watch. Finally, you hope the experience of watching a TV show/movie with friends somehow overcomes the downsides (your friends’ lame banter and the hesitancy you had about this movie choice at this particular time).\nNetflix understands this. That’s why they give premium members the ability for family members to watch four simultaneous streams. Kristen and I can watch a movie in our bedroom, while Kelsey watches in her room, and Britney is on the living room couch. That’s “Movie Enjoyment Made Easy.” No debate about what movie to watch and when! And that’s why I think it’s unlikely that you’ll see Netflix Party implemented anytime soon.\nThanks for reading,\nGib\nGibson Biddle\ngibsonbiddle.com\nPS. Click here to give feedback on this essay.

An objective describes<em> what </em>is to be achieved. The key results state <em>how</em> we accomplish the objective. Let’s say, for example, that the objective is to “increase engagement.” The key results might then be “simplify user journey A” and “enhance feature alpha.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OKRs can be used to create cascading goals—goals that are systematically linked. This is done by using higher-level key results as lower-level objectives, as the following example shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png\" alt=\"Sample Cascading OKRs\" class=\"wp-image-16705\" width=\"666\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-1024x244.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-300x71.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs-768x183.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sample-cascading-OKRs.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Cascading OKRs</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In figure 1, the key result “simplify user journey alpha” becomes an objective with two new key results, “remove user journey step two” and “improve performance by 10%” thereby connecting the two OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to note that OKRs were originally invented by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970ies to facilitate “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent execution</a>,” that is, to help people set hard, measurable goals and to be able to clearly determine if these have been met.

Does this mean that there is a natural fit between goals in product management and OKRs? In order to answer this question, let’s look at a set of product management goals. Figure 2 below shows the goals I recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png\" alt=\"Cascading Product Management Goals\" class=\"wp-image-16704\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1-768x476.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cascading-goals-1.png 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: A Chain of Product-related Goals</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 contains a set of cascading goals: vision, user and business goals, product goals, and sprint goals.

A product goal, finally, helps determine the right <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4076\">sprint goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same token, a sprint goal is a step towards a product goal; achieving a product goal helps you make progress towards the user and business goals; and the latter two finally help you move closer towards your vision.

In the month of November, the goal is to write a 50,000-word novel. (Very quickly, you realize this averages out to 1,667 words a day for 30 days.)</p><p>When I first heard of NaNoWriMo in college, I was instantly swept by the ingenuity of the concept. I’m not one to run an actual marathon, but this felt like the mental equivalent of one: intense, but capped. Extreme yet intoxicating. It felt like stepping into a creative blizzard and emerging at the end with something tangible: the actual bones of a story.</p><blockquote>Here’s the thing: we all have stories to tell.</blockquote><p>Perspectives, parables, proposals, lessons, fantasies — they all live within us, in the dark depths of the mind’s ocean. Writing is the process of fishing these out. It’s the extraction of personal truth, bottled into little black squiggles on crisp white paper. These words help us sweep chaos into order, knit pain into opportunity, multiply the power of great ideas. They help us be known.</p><p>Entire religions, governments and innovations have been constructed from a few pieces of writing. The reading of someone else’s words is the closest thing we have to being able to occupy their mind for a few brief minutes or hours.</p><p>But your writing doesn’t have to be read by someone else for it to be worthwhile.</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of words of my earliest novels have seen no eyes but my own. The extraction process, especially during those Novembers, was sloppy. I often didn’t know what I wanted to say, or the sentences were dull, or the plot meandered like a lost child, or the characters changed histories midway through.</p><p>I failed in my dream of being a published novelist, and there were times when I wondered at all that effort — all those plot holes I tried to mend, the sentences I tried to shape, all those November nights lost in a flurry of typing — what was the point, if nobody was going to read them?</p><p>But now, more than a decade later, I reap the bountiful harvest.</p><p>What is a few hundred thousand wasted words when I have written millions more since then?</p><p>I am a product designer and manager by profession, but oh, how I write. Daily e-mails debating the pros and cons of specific product decisions; mission statements and company values; new strategies and organizational updates; promotion criteria and primers for new employees; letters to myself that turned into widely read blog that turned into a bestselling management book.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that the most important thing in writing is to <em>just get the words down — </em>the discipline of 1667 a day. The words don’t have to be good; they just have to <em>be</em>. Because once they’re down, you have something you can evolve, respond to, and polish.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that writing, reading and thinking go hand-in-hand. As my words sharpened, so did the clarity of my ideas. What used to be an amorphous haze of emotions and fragments now, more often than not, present themselves as a series of structured thoughts.</p><p>I approach reading with more depth as I consider all the choices the author made, and why. I express myself more honesty and connect better with readers. I am learning, over and over again, that writing regularly has many advantages in life.</p><p>NaNoWriMo taught me that writing is fun when you do it for yourself. There is joy in the invention that happens on the page. There is delight in unwrapping a tiny piece of ourselves only to discover what’s behind it is universal.</p><p>For all of you doing this year’s NaNoWriMo — congratulations as you cross into the final day!

In the month of November, the goal is to write a 50,000-word novel. (Very quickly, you realize this averages out to 1,667 words a day for 30 days.)\nWhen I first heard of NaNoWriMo in college, I was instantly swept by the ingenuity of the concept. I’m not one to run an actual marathon, but this felt like the mental equivalent of one: intense, but capped. Extreme yet intoxicating. It felt like stepping into a creative blizzard and emerging at the end with something tangible: the actual bones of a story.\nHere’s the thing: we all have stories to tell.\nPerspectives, parables, proposals, lessons, fantasies — they all live within us, in the dark depths of the mind’s ocean. Writing is the process of fishing these out. It’s the extraction of personal truth, bottled into little black squiggles on crisp white paper. These words help us sweep chaos into order, knit pain into opportunity, multiply the power of great ideas. They help us be known.\nEntire religions, governments and innovations have been constructed from a few pieces of writing. The reading of someone else’s words is the closest thing we have to being able to occupy their mind for a few brief minutes or hours.\nBut your writing doesn’t have to be read by someone else for it to be worthwhile.\nThe hundreds of thousands of words of my earliest novels have seen no eyes but my own. The extraction process, especially during those Novembers, was sloppy. I often didn’t know what I wanted to say, or the sentences were dull, or the plot meandered like a lost child, or the characters changed histories midway through.\nI failed in my dream of being a published novelist, and there were times when I wondered at all that effort — all those plot holes I tried to mend, the sentences I tried to shape, all those November nights lost in a flurry of typing — what was the point, if nobody was going to read them?\nBut now, more than a decade later, I reap the bountiful harvest.\nWhat is a few hundred thousand wasted words when I have written millions more since then?\nI am a product designer and manager by profession, but oh, how I write. Daily e-mails debating the pros and cons of specific product decisions; mission statements and company values; new strategies and organizational updates; promotion criteria and primers for new employees; letters to myself that turned into widely read blog that turned into a bestselling management book.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that the most important thing in writing is to just get the words down — the discipline of 1667 a day. The words don’t have to be good; they just have to be. Because once they’re down, you have something you can evolve, respond to, and polish.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that writing, reading and thinking go hand-in-hand. As my words sharpened, so did the clarity of my ideas. What used to be an amorphous haze of emotions and fragments now, more often than not, present themselves as a series of structured thoughts.\nI approach reading with more depth as I consider all the choices the author made, and why. I express myself more honesty and connect better with readers. I am learning, over and over again, that writing regularly has many advantages in life.\nNaNoWriMo taught me that writing is fun when you do it for yourself. There is joy in the invention that happens on the page. There is delight in unwrapping a tiny piece of ourselves only to discover what’s behind it is universal.\nFor all of you doing this year’s NaNoWriMo — congratulations as you cross into the final day! The end is in sight. Looking back, I hope you’ll find the journey as rewarding as I did. And for those who aren’t, there’s always next year… or next month!

For example, a product manager might determine the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">product strategy</a> and one or more development teams might be tasked with executing it. But as long as innovation, change, and risk are present, this approach is ineffective. Instead, strategy and execution have to be closely connected: The former should not only guide execution, but execution should inform strategy changes and help adapt the strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this insight, I have come up with the product strategy cycle shown in the picture below. It’s a model of an iterative process that systematically links the product strategy with the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/goal-oriented-agile-product-roadmap/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6490\">product roadmap</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/ten-product-backlog-tips/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1301\">product backlog</a>, the development work, and the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10199\">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle, Process Oly\" class=\"wp-image-16650\" width=\"512\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only.png 896w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-300x259.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-only-768x663.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, the process starts at the top of the cycle by creating a new strategy, either for a brand-new product or an existing one. In the latter case, a new strategy might be required to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14245\">extend the product’s life cycle</a>, for example, by addressing a new market or market segment. An effective product strategy should capture the product’s <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9241\">target group, value proposition, standout features, and business goals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you proceed further, you should validate your new strategy and address key risks and assumptions in order to maximise the chances of achieving product success. For example, the market segment you have chosen might be <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">too big and heterogenous</a>, the value proposition might <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/common-product-vision-board-mistakes/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16456\">not be compelling enough</a>, or the business goals might not be feasible. Identifying and addressing the key risks in the product strategy is best done iteratively, as I explain in more detail in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\">Strategize</a></em>. I have therefore placed a small cycle next to &#8220;Product Strategy&#8221; in the picture above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve addressed the key risks and you are confident that you have chosen the right needs, market, standout features, and business goals, you can take the next step and derive a product roadmap from the strategy. I view the roadmap as a product plan that describes how you intend to implement the strategy and which specific benefits or outcomes the product should provide over the next, say, 12 months, based on the needs and business goals stated in the product strategy. I call these outcomes <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13845\">product goals</a></em>. Sample product goals are acquiring new users, increasing engagement, removing technical debt to future-proof the product, and generating revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an actionable product roadmap in place, move on and stock your product backlog. To do so, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">choose the next product goal stated on the product roadmap, determine the features and functionality required to meet it, and capture them in the backlog</a>. Then create just enough <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1172\">ready product backlog items</a> to be able to start the upcoming sprint and develop the actual product. As an iterative process is usually <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-scrum-cycle/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3854\">best suited to create a new product or a major product update</a>, I&#8217;ve added another little cycle between &#8220;Product Backlog&#8221; and &#8220;Product&#8221; on the picture above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After development has started, measure the development progress, for instance, by using a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/release-planning-advice/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15896\">release burndown chart</a>. When an initial or new version of the product has been released, use the KPIs to measure the product performance. These should include the metrics required to determine if the product goal chosen has been met and additional indicators that help you assess how your product is doing and if the strategy is working. Examples of the latter are <em>engagement</em>, <em>retention</em>, <em>product quality</em>, <em>team motivation</em>, and in the case of a revenue-generating product, <em>revenue</em> and <em>cost</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the KPIs and the development progress data to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">review the product strategy</a> and the product roadmap, and change them as appropriate. This might involve making smaller, incremental adjustments. But it might also require you to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\" target=\"_blank\">pivot</a>, to significantly change the strategy in order to make the product successful. Take YouTube as a well-known example. The product pivoted from a dating website to a video-sharing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have now completed the cycle and started another one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Involve the Right People</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Systematically connecting strategy and execution is a key factor to establish an effective product strategy practice. But it is not enough. The best product strategy is useless if the stakeholders and development team(s) do not buy into it and are not prepared to implement the decisions that it captures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maximise the chances that people understand and support the strategic product decisions, I recommend that you involve the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a> and development team representatives in creating and validating the product strategy, developing the product roadmap, tracking the KPIs and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-review-tips-for-product-owners/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13604\">development progress</a>, and updating the plans. Inviting people to contribute to strategic decisions makes it more likely that they understand and support them.  What’s more, this allows you to leverage their expertise, which makes it more likely that you will make the right decisions. If you work on a larger product and in a scaled environment, include the product people who work with you, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature owners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great way to engage the key stakeholders and development team members is to run a collaborative workshop, be it online or in the office. Ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7689\">Scrum Master</a> or another experienced facilitator to help prepare the workshop and facilitate the session. This includes establishing ground rules, selecting a helpful <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule like consent</a>, and ensuring that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. (You can find more advice on collaborative decision-making in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Involving the stakeholder and development team members in the decision-making process puts collaboration at the centre of the strategy cycle, as the picture below shows. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-1024x880.png\" alt=\"Product Strategy Cycle\" class=\"wp-image-16641\" width=\"635\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-1024x880.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-300x258.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle-768x660.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/product-strategy-cycle.png 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All models are wrong, but some are useful,&#8221; as George Box once observed.

If that is not the case, then you might have to adjust the product roadmap, which might even trigger an adjustment of the product strategy. Similarly, if your product backlog experiences significant changes, as you find out, for instance, that a key feature is not required or has to be replaced, you should <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-roadmap-product-backlog/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8491\">consider the impact on the product roadmap</a> and update it as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, you should not forget to engage in <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16533\">continuous product discovery</a>, which includes frequently monitoring new trends and the competition. <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/establishing-an-effective-product-strategy-process/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"14705\">As I have suggested before</a>, spend at least half a day per week carrying out continuous discovery and strategy work including reviewing relevant trends and keeping an eye on the competition.

In this article, I explain how you can use the cycle to join up product strategy, product roadmap, KPIs, product backlog, and development work, and I discuss the role stakeholders and development team members play in making effective strategic product decisions.\nThe post The Product Strategy Cycle appeared first on Roman Pichler.","guid":"https://www.romanpichler.com/?p=16635","categories":["Process: Product Discovery, Agile, Scrum","Product Vision and Strategy","product discovery","scrum","teamwork"],"isoDate":"2020-11-03T08:05:57.000Z"},{"creator":"Roman Pichler","title":"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery","link":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/","pubDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:39:03 +0000","content:encoded":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\" title=\"A Brief Guide to Product Discovery\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/clark-tibbs-oqStl2L5oxI-unsplash-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"something great\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h2>What is Product Discovery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Product discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> should be developed and offered. This increases the chances of creating a product that users actually want and need and achieving product success. Carrying out product discovery involves answering the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the specific value the product should create for the users and customers? What problem should it solve, or which benefit should it create?</li><li>Which market and market segment should the product address? Who are the users and who are the customers?</li><li>What makes the product stand out? How will it differ from competing offerings?</li><li>What are its business goals? How will it benefit the company? For example, generate revenue or meet a profit margin, reduce cost, or develop the brand?</li><li>What business model will it use in order to achieve the business goals, including revenue sources, cost factors, and channels?</li><li>Will the product make a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-ethics/\">positive impact on people’s lives, the wider society, and the planet, or will it at least not cause any harm</a>?</li><li>How might people use the product? What are the major touch points? What kind of user experience (UX) should the product give rise to?</li><li>How can the product be built? What architecture patterns and technologies may be used?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to answer the questions above, you may want to use techniques such as direct observation, user interviews, prototyping, creating a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">strategy canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>, and you may capture some of them using a tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a>. Whatever you do, I suggest that you follow Steve Blank’s advice and “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/\" target=\"_blank\">get out of the building</a>”. Meeting users and customers, at least in form of a video call, not only helps you validate your assumptions and develop new ideas. It also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empathy-tips-product-management/\">empathise with the individuals</a> and to better understand their perspectives and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it helpful to distinguish two types of product discovery: timeboxed and continuous discovery. Let’s look at timeboxed product discovery first.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeboxed Product Di<strong>scovery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you create a brand-new product or when you make bigger changes to an existing one, like <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/strategic-options-for-mature-products/\">taking it to a new market</a>, you will benefit from using a dedicated, timeboxed product discovery period. This results in an innovation process like the one shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png\" alt=\"product discovery vs product development\" class=\"wp-image-16536\" width=\"561\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-1024x313.png 1024w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-300x92.png 300w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development-768x234.png 768w, https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/product-discovery-vs-product-development.png 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the picture above, product discovery precedes product development. The former focuses on understanding if and why a product should be created or updated. The latter largely determines how the product should be developed. This includes discovering the right UX design and functionality and making the right technical decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I have purposefully drawn discovery and development as overlapping, as I find it helpful to address major UX and technical risks as part of the discovery work—without making the mistake of using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front\" target=\"_blank\">big design upfront (BDU)</a>. Addressing these risks ensures that the development team has the right knowledge to hit the ground running <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owners-checklist-for-the-first-sprint-in-scrum/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8888\">when starting development</a>. Consequently, the key discovery deliverables include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> and business model,</li><li>Actionable <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a> that implements the strategy,</li><li>Initial product backlog that captures the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-lean-product-backlog-variation-and-overburden/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"591\">necessary product details</a>,</li><li>A high-level UX design concept and coarse-grained software architecture supplemented by throwaway prototypes (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\">spikes</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As it’s notoriously difficult to correctly forecast how much time a bigger piece of discovery work will require, I recommend timeboxing the product discovery work. To do so, consider the amount of innovation and risk present and allocate an appropriate timebox. If you were to develop a brand-new product for a new market with new technologies, for instance, then you would face more risks compared to taking an existing product to a new market. Consequently, the former will require more time than the latter. You might want to allocate, say, two months for the first initiative, but only two weeks for the latter, assuming that you already serve the new target market. Additionally, I recommend running weekly review sessions to understand the progress of the discovery work and adapt it if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out the discovery work, bring together the right people, product person, development team representative, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\">key stakeholders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or agile coach, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/discovery-and-strategizing-team-1024x489.png\" alt=\"Product Discovery Team\" class=\"wp-image-14741\" width=\"555\" height=\"262\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in charge of the product, you should lead the discovery and development effort. Here’s why: You can’t be responsible for maximising the value a product creates if you don’t actively participate in, guide the discovery work, and shape the strategic product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team representatives—ideally a UX designer, one or two developers, and a tester—should also engage in the discovery activities. This leverages the individuals’ knowledge and creativity; it surfaces feasibility issues and technical risks; and it allows the team members acquire knowledge about the market and users and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\">understand why the product is being created or updated</a>. The latter will <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/empowering-development-teams/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15712\">enable the development team to make the right design and technical decisions and own the solution</a>. Do make sure that the individuals continue to work on the team in development and help build the product. Otherwise, you are likely to lose precious knowledge and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting the key stakeholders to participate in the product discovery work ensures that their ideas and concerns are taken into account at an early stage; it takes advantage of their expertise; and it maximises the chances that they will support the resulting strategic product decisions: When <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">people are given the opportunity to contribute to a decision</a>, they are more likely to understand and buy into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scrum Master or agile coach, finally, should facilitate the discovery process and the meetings in order to ensure that everybody is heard, and nobody dominates. This may include suggesting applying a Kanban-based process to visualise and manage the discovery and strategy work, as I recommend in my book <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Co</strong>ntinuous Product Discovery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As helpful as timeboxed product discovery is, it is not enough. Here is why: When you create a brand-new product, you typically aim to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), a good enough offering that addresses the early market. To achieve product-market fit and make the product successful, more discovery work is required: You now need to figure out how to adapt your product to serve the needs of the mainstream market. But even once you’ve entered the growth stage, you can’t afford to neglect discovery. The world doesn’t stand still: Markets and technologies change, competitors improve their products, and new market entrants may appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product management is therefore like riding a bike: When I am on my bike—which is one of my favourite pastime activities—I have to turn the cranks, change gears, steer the bike, and so on. But if I forget to look ahead, I’ll sooner or later get lost or even crash. The same is true for your product: If you are completely immersed in execution and forget about discovery, you’re likely to miss an opportunity or threat and experience difficulties further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore important that you carry out continuous product discovery. This includes the following activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Review the product performance using the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-how-to-choose-the-right-product-key-performance-indicators-kpis/\">key performance indicators</a>. Analyse the data collected to understand how your product is doing. Do the metrics show a positive, flat, or negative trend? What conclusions can you draw from the analysis? What measures would help you achieve the desired product performance?</li><li>Look for opportunities. Are there any new technology, regulatory, or social trends that you should be aware of? Do they offer an opportunity to innovate, add, remove, or enhance product features, or even create a brand-new product? Talking to users, attending trade shows and conferences, and participating in the online communities can help you spot new trends. Giving the dev team time to investigate new technologies will allow you to take advantage of opportunities and improve your product.</li><li>Keep an eye on the competition. Are your competitors launching new products or features? Are there any new market entrants? Should you respond to any of these changes? If so, which actions are appropriate? Job postings can help you guess your competitors’ plans. Reviewing their products will tell you <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">if your product is still sufficiently differentiated</a>.</li><li>Follow the developments at your own company: Are there any changes to the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/business-strategy-and-product-strategy/\">business strategy</a>? And if so, what are the consequences for your product? </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you answer the questions above and carry out the related work, I recommend the following two measures:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, block at least one hour per day in your calendar to carry out product discovery and strategy work. This helps you avoid nasty surprises, such as a competitor leapfrogging you by offering a new killer feature, and it makes it more likely that you recognise early warning signs like declining sign-up rates, increasing churn, or growing number of support calls. This allows you to be responsive and take actions early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, regularly hold <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-effective-product-strategy-reviews/\">collaborative strategy reviews</a>, once per quarter, as a rule of thumb. Assess the product strategy and product roadmap together with development team representatives and key stakeholders. These are ideally the same people who participated in the timeboxed discovery work and who helped you create the current product strategy and roadmap. As mentioned before, involving dev team members and stakeholders leverages their collective creativity and knowledge, creates alignment, and mitigates the risk that the individuals don’t support necessary strategy changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Few Thoughts on Product Discovery in a Scaled Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you manage a larger product and you work in a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/scaling-the-product-owner/\">scaled environment</a>, don’t forget to involve the other people who look after the product, for example, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/six-types-of-product-owners/\">feature and component owners or SAFe product owners</a>, in both timeboxed and continuous discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the collaboration benefits already mentioned, this makes it more likely that strategic decisions will be translated into tactical ones, and it ensures that tactical insights—like the knowledge gained from analysing user feedback on specific features—informs the strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/a-brief-guide-to-product-discovery/\">A Brief Guide to Product Discovery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com\">Roman Pichler</a>.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"What is Product Discovery?\nProduct discovery describes the activities required to determine if and why a product should be developed and offered.

When I first encountered this story as a wide-eyed immigrant kid, I loved the idea that a smart, resourceful little girl could one-up the bullies. And not just kid bullies, but the the All-Powerful Adult Authority Bullies! Who doesn’t dream of that?</p><p>It wasn’t just Matilda. Looking back now, I see that so many of the stories I adored back then glorified the power of the individual. <em>You</em> could be the Chosen One. <em>You </em>could vanquish your foes, save the day, or turn a sticky situation into a happy ending. It doesn’t matter if you grew up in an orphanage or your childhood was absolutely miserable. That just made you more capable and deserving of the final rewards.</p><p>The appeal of that message is like honey when we’re small and powerless. But now that I have kids of my own, I can’t help thinking: <em>What will be the impact of Matilda’s parents treating her so poorly and then essentially abandoning her?</em></p><p>How will this affect her ability to trust others? How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?</p><p>It’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.</p><p><strong><em>“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — </em></strong>attributed to Sengcan</p><p>One of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:</p><ul><li>No situational problem-solving questions (“<em>What would do if X happened?</em>”)</li><li>No questions about my past roles (<em>“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”</em>)</li><li>No technical questions</li><li><em>Only</em> questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.</li></ul><p>I thought this was a fascinating interesting technique. I was tossed questions like <em>“What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome in your life?”</em> and <em>“Where did your drive come from?”</em> It felt as if the interviewer was trying to open my skull to discern what made me tick. Would my mindset fit in with this particular team? Would I be compelled to shoot for the same stars?</p><p>The whole thing got me wondering: what <em>does</em> make us tick? Certainly there is our genetic make-up. Any parent with multiple kids (me included) will happily talk you to sleep about how different their offspring are. My grandma likes to remind me that I was a hard-to-raise kid, the impish, rebellious sort, and my daughter got this “gene” but my son didn’t.</p><p>But increasingly, I believe much of my thinking and behavior is shaped by the thousands of circumstances outside my direct control.</p><p>What was the biggest challenge I had to overcome in my life?</p><p>How to feel like I belonged when, as a six-year-old, I boarded a plane to the United States alone to meet parents who were strangers to me.

I’m Julie Zhuo. I help companies scale and build people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a popular management book. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. The Looking Glass is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.\n\nOne glorious thing about having an almost six-year-old is that we’ve started to read some of my favorite childhood books together.\nRecently, we read Matilda by Roald Dahl. When I first encountered this story as a wide-eyed immigrant kid, I loved the idea that a smart, resourceful little girl could one-up the bullies. And not just kid bullies, but the the All-Powerful Adult Authority Bullies! Who doesn’t dream of that?\nIt wasn’t just Matilda. Looking back now, I see that so many of the stories I adored back then glorified the power of the individual. You could be the Chosen One. You could vanquish your foes, save the day, or turn a sticky situation into a happy ending. It doesn’t matter if you grew up in an orphanage or your childhood was absolutely miserable. That just made you more capable and deserving of the final rewards.\nThe appeal of that message is like honey when we’re small and powerless. But now that I have kids of my own, I can’t help thinking: What will be the impact of Matilda’s parents treating her so poorly and then essentially abandoning her?\nHow will this affect her ability to trust others? How she seeks love and approval in the future? How she views herself?\nIt’s with some sadness that I suspect a real-life Matilda will have a lot more to grapple with than the story lets on.\n“Return to the root and you will find the meaning” — attributed to Sengcan\nOne of the more memorable job interviews I’ve had went something like this:\n\nNo situational problem-solving questions (“What would do if X happened?”)\nNo questions about my past roles (“Describe the biggest challenge you faced when…”)\nNo technical questions\nOnly questions related to my upbringing and broader life story.\n\nI thought this was a fascinating interesting technique. I was tossed questions like “What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome in your life?” and “Where did your drive come from?” It felt as if the interviewer was trying to open my skull to discern what made me tick. Would my mindset fit in with this particular team? Would I be compelled to shoot for the same stars?\nThe whole thing got me wondering: what does make us tick? Certainly there is our genetic make-up. Any parent with multiple kids (me included) will happily talk you to sleep about how different their offspring are. My grandma likes to remind me that I was a hard-to-raise kid, the impish, rebellious sort, and my daughter got this “gene” but my son didn’t.\nBut increasingly, I believe much of my thinking and behavior is shaped by the thousands of circumstances outside my direct control.\nWhat was the biggest challenge I had to overcome in my life?\nHow to feel like I belonged when, as a six-year-old, I boarded a plane to the United States alone to meet parents who were strangers to me. How to fit in when my classmates spoke of camping and tooth fairies and trampolines as they ate their PB&J while I picked at my “weird Chinese leftovers” and wondered what they meant. How to prove myself worthy of years of sacrifice.\nThis constant yearning to belong explains so much about my behavior today, in ways both big and small. It’s why I’m fanatical about celebrating traditions. You better believe I’ve got a stack of mooncakes for this week’s Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, and my kids’ Tooth Fairy writes long letters about good dental hygiene. It’s why I avoid engaging in public conflicts on Twitter and elsewhere. It’s why I’m determined to prove myself over and over again, sometimes past the point where it serves me.\nMy family runs deep in my roots as well. Every few months, I’ll realize with fresh shock that I am doing something just as my mom does, despite my deep-seated narrative that I’m SO incredibly different from her. For example, earlier this year it hit me that my default tendency is to believe there is an objective “best” path forward in any situation, which is how she sees the world. But this is not my intention. Once I recognized this, I could start to unwind the thought pattern and remind myself that often we are choosing from many fulfilling paths, or choosing the one that best matches our needs at a given moment in time. Sometimes there is simply no such thing as “objectively best.” Chance plays a huge role in specific outcomes anyway, so why not just enjoy the journey?\nUnderstand the roots, and you can understand the body. I know one person who never locks their doors because they grew up in a warm, close-knit community. I know another who is adamant about installing security features because they’ve experienced break-ins before. I know decorated former athletes who to this day are incredibly motivated by the idea of winning; I know others with losing Little League records who care far more about the players than the score.\nWhen we’ve been badly hurt by those we love, we find it difficult to trust again; when we’re repeatedly shown a vision of what “good” looks like, that influences our North Star. We treat people the way we’ve been treated. The body always keeps the score.\nSome of the explorations of one’s roots are joyful and heartwarming, some are dark. Some are best done with a trained therapist or medical professional. I am sure I will be unearthing my roots for the rest of my life, and I’m glad for it. Our past doesn’t define use, and we can always change for the better.\nBut the better I understand where I came from, the more content I become; the sharper the future seems.\nHow well do we understand our roots?\nIf I asked you to describe yourself, I bet you’d have a well-practiced answer for me. You’d tell me about your interests, your work, your childhood, your family.\nBut personal stories are complex and richly layered. My own answers to the same questions evolve year over year.

Fluff gets eroded away.\nEvery six months or so, I try to ask myself the same things:\n\nWhat kinds of people do you admire and hope to emulate? Why?\nWhat do you love about yourself? Why do you love those things?\nWhat do you dislike about yourself? Why do you think you feel that way?\nWhat do you consider the greatest challenges in your life? How did you respond?\nWhat are some recent examples of things you tried and failed at?

We can get a peek into the thoughts and lifestyles of practically anyone we’re interested in, whether they’re top epidemiologists, activists, politicians, influencers or innovators. We can find kindred spirits we’ve never met before that share our undying love of ramen and Death Note and wacky real estate listings. With just a few <em>Follows</em>, we can tumble down the rabbit hole of our curiosity.</p><p>But with this access comes a belief that just because we see more, we can also come to better conclusions about more topics — whether wearing masks is necessary, whether saying or doing X is deplorable, whether TikTok is good or bad, whether a certain executive should be fired, whether designers should code/do woodworking/wear top hats.</p><p>We’re entitled to our own opinions, of course, but in reading through so many of these debates, I find myself wondering:</p><h4><em>Is social media actually making us better informed?</em></h4><p>Here’s what it feels like sometimes: you and I are looking at a picture in the distance. We’re standing in different spots, so parts of our view are blocked.</p><p>You say: “This picture has wonderful blue sky tones.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_zLhqqEquD8tSG5J.png\" /></figure><p>And I say: “What are you talking about? There’s so much exquisite detail in these little vignettes that are totally orange!”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*erP_Rw2g_tUFVtnm.png\" /></figure><p>And a third acquaintance chimes in and says: “You’re both wrong. This picture is about dudes reading.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n6lQkKx6w9RQ6eNm.png\" /></figure><p>And some other random person on the Internet is like: “You all suck. I’m an expert, and architecture is what makes this 💯.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9XikEWm13pccTw0X.png\" /></figure><h4>Who is right?</h4><p>Well, everybody.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6fswlaSHr-3WzVh5.png\" /></figure><p>None of the observations are patently false. But the fact that we’re arguing about them is ridiculous. We’re all reporting the picture as we see it, but we each see such a small slice.</p><p>Some of us who have spent far more energy — years or decades, maybe — in understanding a thing might have have uncovered more of the picture, but even then, every perspective has blind spots.</p><p>One of my great frustrations with social media today is that it’s so hard to zoom out and gain an appreciation for the complexity of a given topic. Short, Tweet-like posts constrain observations to these micro-squares, stripping them of context and nuance. Covid hits, and suddenly it seems like everyone and their dog is an expert on how to deal with pandemics.</p><p>The problem gets even worse when you throw bad actors into the mix who intentionally lie and mislead. Now we have to deal with a bunch of voices claiming that this picture is actually about Martians and submitting false pixels as evidence.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xSSna_WGnsohipzz.png\" /></figure><p>Putting bad actors aside for a second, I suspect most posters on social media <em>are</em> describing their little view rectangles as they see it.</p><p>We may disagree on how representative that rectangle is — does a few guys holding books make <em>reading</em> the most salient theme? Is architecture really why this picture is so famous, or is it the dynamism of the figures, the noble subject matter, or the sheer scale?</p><p>But assuming the other party is stupid or dishonest or wicked for pointing out that they see blue clouds is not helping us understand the image any better. It’s just causing us to waste time and energy.</p><p>It’s why I struggle to agree or disagree with one-line takes on social media, or why I find writing short, pithy tweets exceedingly challenging. Everything that sounds like a sweet aphorism feels right in some contexts and wrong in others. Is Tiktok good or bad? Good for some, bad for others. Should a certain executive be fired? The people who know the most should judge. Should designers code? It depends on the designer and their goals.</p><p>Unfortunately, “It depends” is a dull answer. Nobody reshares “It depends.” And the long explanations summarizing centuries of critical analyses for why “The School of Athens” is such a famous painting is simply tl;dr for most of us.</p><p>Our human brain craves villains and heroes, conflicts and denouements, the entirety of a story heard and judgement rendered in the time it takes for a quarantine lunch to heat up. Is it any wonder why our communication systems have evolved to ever shorter and shorter snippets of narrative? We went from the book to the blog to the tweet; the movie to the YouTube episode to the TikTok video.</p><p>And yet, “It depends” is often the path to real wisdom. It invites more questions, leads to more of the picture being filled in. It’s not sexy, but actual learning and problem solving rarely is. It’s the spiritual sibling to all those things we rationally know are good for us but struggle to choose: the carrots over the chips; the workout shoes over the couch; meaningful time with loved ones over mindless scrolling of blue screens.</p><p><em>Is social media actually making us better informed?</em> Maybe a better question to ask is:</p><h4>How can social media systems better incentivize informedness?</h4><p>I’ll throw out a proposal: Give <strong>verified users</strong> the <strong>ability to determine</strong> if a particular post needs more <strong>factual context</strong>. If <strong>enough viewers</strong> flag something as needing more context, <strong>factual context</strong> automatically appears next to the post.</p><p>Let’s dive into this a bit more:</p><p><strong>Why verified users?</strong> Given the prevalence of bots and coordinated misinformation campaigns, why not extend identity verification beyond just advertisers and blue-check celebrities to everyone? Make it easy to create an account and get started, but if you want to grow your influence, let’s make sure you’re a real person. Imagine capping your post’s distribution or limiting your ability to send engagement signals to the system (in the form of clicks, reports, votes, etc) unless you provide identification.</p><p><strong>Why give people the ability to determine?</strong> Empowering a vast group of people to add context to content is a lot more democratic and scalable than a small, centralized body making unilateral decisions about what posts should stay up or go down. Plus, we all know the gray zone is vast. Some posts don’t violate policies but cherry-pick certain facts and omit others in ways that distort the picture. Give people the power to fill in the blanks.</p><p><strong>Why factual context?</strong> This is the fuzziest part of the proposal, because facts are notoriously tricky to define. Even if we agree on the facts (“who did what when?”), the way they are presented can favor certain interpretations over others. The proposal here is to let verified users browse a database of approved factual statements from independent fact-checkers and submit them to be included along with the original post.</p><p><strong>Why automatically trigger when enough users do this?</strong> In order for a system to feel democratic, the rules for how it works need to be transparent. The trigger could be some combination of % of users who saw the post and flagged it and total number of viewers. The more a post is seen, the more scrutiny it should receive.</p><p><strong>Why is this proposal awesome</strong>? I make no claims that this proposal is awesome. I share it because I hope to inspire critique and alternatives. This is where I throw you a heaping pile of caveats — that the proposal has holes and may be impractical and may lead to new vectors of abuse and gamification. Complexifying an already-complex system is a fool’s errand, and throwing more things in front of people doesn’t mean they’ll absorb it. But if you think this solution sucks and have a better one, share it! Or if parts of this proposal inspire new ideas, by all means build upon them.</p><h4>Is social media more good than bad?</h4><p>Depends on who you ask. The prevailing narratives, like Pokemon, have gone through so many forms already. Once, many hailed social media as the harbinger of democracy. Now, it’s blamed for the erosion of it. If you ask me, my answer is <em>Yes, social media is more good than bad</em>. Information travels today at unheard of speeds, much of it to strengthen relationships, nurture communities, spread ideas, and accelerate innovation. But the same tools also sow division, disguise truth, and enable crime. Our experiences with social media reflect the good and bad of humanity. In our lives, we’re somebody’s demon and somebody else’s angel. Still, I choose to believe that <em>we</em> are more good than bad.</p><p>And yet. Social media tools can and should improve. Between the walls of “free speech” and “make the platforms safer” lies a fertile ground of possibilities. I am reminded of a school cafeteria design I heard about once, where the problem to be solved was: “How can schools incentive healthier eating?”</p><p><em>Get rid of all those flaming hot cheetoes!</em> you might think. <em>Slap nutritional labels on everything!</em> Instead, they kept the exact same lunch options but made the unhealthy stuff harder to access. Ice cream was put behind a closed, opaque door. Water lived next to the cash register while soda hung out in a different section of the cafeteria. Plates were smaller in size.</p><p>Guess what?

Should Rick be fired? Should designers wear top hats? Also: How can social media systems better incentivize informedness?\n👋 Hi! I’m Julie Zhuo. I help companies scale and build people-centric products informed by data. I’m the author of a popular management book. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. The Looking Glass is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.\nOne of the great gifts of social media is the way it expands our understanding of the world.\nIt used to be that our exposure to facts and opinions came from the dozens of people we see regularly in real life — besties, those colleagues we do Taco Tuesdays with, our parents and Uncle Paul and Cousin Maria, those high-school bandmates that we see once a year — along with the handful of TV channels, books or newspapers.\nToday, thanks to social media, those dozens of opinions have become hundreds or thousands. We can get a peek into the thoughts and lifestyles of practically anyone we’re interested in, whether they’re top epidemiologists, activists, politicians, influencers or innovators. We can find kindred spirits we’ve never met before that share our undying love of ramen and Death Note and wacky real estate listings. With just a few Follows, we can tumble down the rabbit hole of our curiosity.\nBut with this access comes a belief that just because we see more, we can also come to better conclusions about more topics — whether wearing masks is necessary, whether saying or doing X is deplorable, whether TikTok is good or bad, whether a certain executive should be fired, whether designers should code/do woodworking/wear top hats.\nWe’re entitled to our own opinions, of course, but in reading through so many of these debates, I find myself wondering:\nIs social media actually making us better informed?\nHere’s what it feels like sometimes: you and I are looking at a picture in the distance. We’re standing in different spots, so parts of our view are blocked.\nYou say: “This picture has wonderful blue sky tones.”\n\nAnd I say: “What are you talking about? There’s so much exquisite detail in these little vignettes that are totally orange!”\n\nAnd a third acquaintance chimes in and says: “You’re both wrong. This picture is about dudes reading.”\n\nAnd some other random person on the Internet is like: “You all suck. I’m an expert, and architecture is what makes this 💯.”\n\nWho is right?\nWell, everybody.\n\nNone of the observations are patently false. But the fact that we’re arguing about them is ridiculous. We’re all reporting the picture as we see it, but we each see such a small slice.\nSome of us who have spent far more energy — years or decades, maybe — in understanding a thing might have have uncovered more of the picture, but even then, every perspective has blind spots.\nOne of my great frustrations with social media today is that it’s so hard to zoom out and gain an appreciation for the complexity of a given topic. Short, Tweet-like posts constrain observations to these micro-squares, stripping them of context and nuance. Covid hits, and suddenly it seems like everyone and their dog is an expert on how to deal with pandemics.\nThe problem gets even worse when you throw bad actors into the mix who intentionally lie and mislead. Now we have to deal with a bunch of voices claiming that this picture is actually about Martians and submitting false pixels as evidence.\n\nPutting bad actors aside for a second, I suspect most posters on social media are describing their little view rectangles as they see it.\nWe may disagree on how representative that rectangle is — does a few guys holding books make reading the most salient theme? Is architecture really why this picture is so famous, or is it the dynamism of the figures, the noble subject matter, or the sheer scale?\nBut assuming the other party is stupid or dishonest or wicked for pointing out that they see blue clouds is not helping us understand the image any better. It’s just causing us to waste time and energy.\nIt’s why I struggle to agree or disagree with one-line takes on social media, or why I find writing short, pithy tweets exceedingly challenging. Everything that sounds like a sweet aphorism feels right in some contexts and wrong in others. Is Tiktok good or bad? Good for some, bad for others. Should a certain executive be fired? The people who know the most should judge. Should designers code? It depends on the designer and their goals.\nUnfortunately, “It depends” is a dull answer. Nobody reshares “It depends.” And the long explanations summarizing centuries of critical analyses for why “The School of Athens” is such a famous painting is simply tl;dr for most of us.\nOur human brain craves villains and heroes, conflicts and denouements, the entirety of a story heard and judgement rendered in the time it takes for a quarantine lunch to heat up. Is it any wonder why our communication systems have evolved to ever shorter and shorter snippets of narrative? We went from the book to the blog to the tweet; the movie to the YouTube episode to the TikTok video.\nAnd yet, “It depends” is often the path to real wisdom. It invites more questions, leads to more of the picture being filled in. It’s not sexy, but actual learning and problem solving rarely is. It’s the spiritual sibling to all those things we rationally know are good for us but struggle to choose: the carrots over the chips; the workout shoes over the couch; meaningful time with loved ones over mindless scrolling of blue screens.\nIs social media actually making us better informed? Maybe a better question to ask is:\nHow can social media systems better incentivize informedness?\nI’ll throw out a proposal: Give verified users the ability to determine if a particular post needs more factual context. If enough viewers flag something as needing more context, factual context automatically appears next to the post.\nLet’s dive into this a bit more:\nWhy verified users? Given the prevalence of bots and coordinated misinformation campaigns, why not extend identity verification beyond just advertisers and blue-check celebrities to everyone? Make it easy to create an account and get started, but if you want to grow your influence, let’s make sure you’re a real person. Imagine capping your post’s distribution or limiting your ability to send engagement signals to the system (in the form of clicks, reports, votes, etc) unless you provide identification.\nWhy give people the ability to determine? Empowering a vast group of people to add context to content is a lot more democratic and scalable than a small, centralized body making unilateral decisions about what posts should stay up or go down. Plus, we all know the gray zone is vast. Some posts don’t violate policies but cherry-pick certain facts and omit others in ways that distort the picture. Give people the power to fill in the blanks.\nWhy factual context? This is the fuzziest part of the proposal, because facts are notoriously tricky to define. Even if we agree on the facts (“who did what when?”), the way they are presented can favor certain interpretations over others. The proposal here is to let verified users browse a database of approved factual statements from independent fact-checkers and submit them to be included along with the original post.\nWhy automatically trigger when enough users do this? In order for a system to feel democratic, the rules for how it works need to be transparent. The trigger could be some combination of % of users who saw the post and flagged it and total number of viewers. The more a post is seen, the more scrutiny it should receive.\nWhy is this proposal awesome? I make no claims that this proposal is awesome. I share it because I hope to inspire critique and alternatives. This is where I throw you a heaping pile of caveats — that the proposal has holes and may be impractical and may lead to new vectors of abuse and gamification. Complexifying an already-complex system is a fool’s errand, and throwing more things in front of people doesn’t mean they’ll absorb it. But if you think this solution sucks and have a better one, share it! Or if parts of this proposal inspire new ideas, by all means build upon them.\nIs social media more good than bad?\nDepends on who you ask. The prevailing narratives, like Pokemon, have gone through so many forms already. Once, many hailed social media as the harbinger of democracy. Now, it’s blamed for the erosion of it. If you ask me, my answer is Yes, social media is more good than bad. Information travels today at unheard of speeds, much of it to strengthen relationships, nurture communities, spread ideas, and accelerate innovation. But the same tools also sow division, disguise truth, and enable crime. Our experiences with social media reflect the good and bad of humanity. In our lives, we’re somebody’s demon and somebody else’s angel. Still, I choose to believe that we are more good than bad.\nAnd yet. Social media tools can and should improve. Between the walls of “free speech” and “make the platforms safer” lies a fertile ground of possibilities. I am reminded of a school cafeteria design I heard about once, where the problem to be solved was: “How can schools incentive healthier eating?”\nGet rid of all those flaming hot cheetoes! you might think. Slap nutritional labels on everything! Instead, they kept the exact same lunch options but made the unhealthy stuff harder to access. Ice cream was put behind a closed, opaque door. Water lived next to the cash register while soda hung out in a different section of the cafeteria. Plates were smaller in size.\nGuess what? Kids ate better.\nWhat could we design to better incentive informedness? How can we make it easier to pursue the truth in wonderful collaborative fashion, as Raphael imagined in his masterpiece fresco?\nThere’s work to be done. I’m looking forward to the next chapter.","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ef227e726e5e","isoDate":"2020-09-02T14:30:40.000Z"},{"creator":"Roman Pichler","title":"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important","link":"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 08:19:45 +0000","content:encoded":"<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/prioritising-a-product-backlog-when-everything-is-important/\" title=\"Prioritising a Product Backlog When Everything is Important\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrishna-flickr-e1590504925764-150x150.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ducks in a row\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" /></a>\n<h2>Step 1: Ensure that you know who the product is for and why people will want to use it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll never forget the day when I suggested to the product manager of a brand-new healthcare product to prioritise its features. The individual looked at me slightly bewildered and replied, &#8220;I can’t. They are all high-priority.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritisation requires deciding how important an item is. If everything is high priority, everything is equally important. This means in effect that nothing is a priority. But without clear priorities, the development team lacks direction, and there is only a slim chance of creating a successful product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common root cause of not being able to prioritise a product backlog is a lack of understanding of who the users of the product are and what specific value it should create for them. I find it not uncommon that features are added to the product backlog because a senior <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-engagement-analysis-power-interest-grid/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10096\">stakeholder</a> demands it (HIPPO syndrome) or someone thinks it is a good idea (“let’s brainstorm some <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"664\">user stories</a>”). But <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">a product</a> exists to generate value for the users and for the company providing it. If it is not clear who the users are and why they would want to interact with the product, it will be hard to decide which items should be in the product backlog and how important they are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate the risk of adding the wrong items to the product backlog, ensure that you have a validated <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/elements-definition-product-strategy/\">product strategy</a> in place, no matter if you look after a brand-new or as an existing product. Such a strategy should clearly state the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The users and customers of the product so that it is clear who will benefit from it and who won’t;</li><li>The main problem the product should address or the primary benefit it should offer, or the main goal users will want to achieve with it;</li><li>The three to five features that will make it stand out from the crowd;</li><li>The specific benefits it should create for the business.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at a brief example and say that I want to create a product that helps people eat healthily. Then I could choose to address middle aged men who suffer from unhealthy eating habits and who don’t exercise enough. The benefit might be to reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The standout features might be to measure food sugar levels, analyse the user’s eating habits, and integrate with leading smart scales. The business goals, finally, might be to diversify my company and open up a new revenue stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you should be confident that your strategy is correct, and you should have data to support your view. In other words, you should have addressed the key assumptions and risks in the product strategy, and you should have carried out the necessary validation work. A tool like my <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/\">product vision board</a> helps you capture and validate your product strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Describe the outcome or benefit the product should create in the next few months</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a product strategy in place is great, but it is not enough to effectively prioritise a product backlog. What’s required is a specific <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leading-through-shared-goals/\">product goal</a> that is connected to the strategy and creates the right context to decide which backlog items are more important and which ones are less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create such a goal, ask yourself which outcome or benefit your product should achieve in the next, say, three to six months. What are the desired user and business benefits you want to create? Make sure that this goal is in line with the product strategy and that it helps create the desired user and business benefits. An example based on the sample strategy above would be &#8220;help the users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base.&#8221; (Note that I have chosen a compound goal that captures the desired user and business benefits.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to take this idea further, derive several product goals from the product strategy for the next 12 months, and capture them on a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/\">product roadmap</a>. This puts the goal chosen in context and communicates how the product is likely to evolve over a longer period. If you have a product roadmap, then ensure that it implements the overall product strategy. Consider reworking it so that it clearly states the desired outcomes your product should achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Remove all items from the product backlog that do not support the desired outcome</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, use the product goal you have chosen to delete all items from the product backlog that do not serve it. While this approach might sound radical, it ensures that your backlog becomes concise and focused. It avoids having items on the backlog that are speculative and may not create value, and maybe even more importantly, it facilitates prioritisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe that removing the product backlog items is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, then this may indicate that you lack the necessary <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">empowerment</a> and/or that the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/stakeholder-management-tips-for-product-people/\">stakeholders</a> do not buy into the overall product strategy and the specific product goal you have chosen. Involving the individuals in the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11735\">decision-making process</a> can help address both issues. This allows the stakeholders to voice their ideas and concerns, and it makes it more likely that they understand and support important product decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to decide together with the stakeholders, then invite them to a meeting. Carefully prepare the session and choose a <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/decision-rules-to-make-better-product-decisions/\">decision rule</a>, for instance, consent. Additionally, ask your <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/every-great-product-owner-needs-great-scrummaster/\">Scrum Master</a> or another skilled facilitator to help run the meeting so that everyone is heard, and nobody dominates. (I offer more advice on securing stakeholder buy-in and decision-making in my book <em><a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\">How to Lead in Product Management</a></em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Prioritise the remaining product backlog items</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now prioritise the remaining product backlog items. I recommend that you prioritise a new or significantly changed product backlog initially by risk, taking into account the user, technology, and business-related risks. Assess all backlog items together with the development team and move those to the top that carry the highest risk. This approach <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/leveraging-failure-in-product-management/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13630\">accelerates learning</a> and it avoids failing late when there are less options to change course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, ensure that the high-priority items are &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/\">ready</a>&#8220;, that the development team and you have a shared understanding of them, that the team can implement them in the next sprint, and that they are testable.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering what was up with the healthcare product I mentioned earlier.

Additionally, such a vision is hardly inspiring. A good vision exercises pull—it describes a future state that people want to bring about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong>: A confusion about what an effective product vision is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Describe the ultimate purpose of your product, the positive change the product should bring about like “healthy eating”. Think of the vision as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html\" target=\"_blank\">big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)</a> that inspires people and offers a continuity of purpose for the next five to ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/\">8 Tips for Creating A Compelling Product Vision</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Target Group is (too) Big and Heterogenous</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Everyone who owns a smartphone”, “Business users and consumers”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A very big and diverse target group makes it hard to formulate a crisp, compelling value proposition and strong standout features. It can also result in a large product backlog and high development cost: The greater the number of people who should benefit from your product is, the more diverse their needs are likely to be, and the more features are usually required to address them. Trying to offer a product that pleases everybody carries the risk of not doing a good job for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: A lack of understanding of users and their needs, lack of empowerment of the person in charge of the product, inappropriate growth strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Successful products are not built by agreeing on the smallest common denominator or trying to please powerful stakeholders. Instead, they require tough strategic decision and clear focus. Therefore, choose a specific market segment and develop a product for the few, not the many, as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank suggested</a>, particularly when you manage a new or young product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After your product has reached product-market fit and has become more feature rich, consider unbundling bigger features and creating product variants to address the needs of specific groups. For example, I might decide to offer a version for middle aged men to help them reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a version for children to help them overcome a specific eating disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">strengthen your ability to guide the stakeholders and dev teams</a>: Increase your referent power and earn people’s trust, strengthen your product management expertise, and lobby for more management support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/market-segmentation-tips-for-product-managers/\">Market Segmentation Tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 59; <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-product-leadership-power/\">Boost Your Product Leadership Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 36.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many Needs but No Compelling Reason for Using the Product</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Lose weight, be more active, feel better, be fitter”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: If a product does not address a clear and compelling need, it will be difficult to encourage users to use it; uptake and engagement are likely to be poor. Consequently, it will be hard to achieve the desired business benefits and monetise the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of understanding what problems users really face and what they really need; a target group that is too large and heterogenous, as discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the main reason for people to use the product, the primary benefit that the product should offer to the users or the main problem it should address. Another approach is to identify the main goal users will want to achieve by using the product or to find the primary job the product should do for them. Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews in order get to know the users, empathise with the individuals, and develop a thorough understanding of their needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More <strong>Information</strong></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 94, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/how-to-lead-in-product-management/\"><em>How to Lead in Product Management</em></a>, pp. 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs are Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy to use, calorie counter, works on iOS and Android”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When features—in the sense of product capabilities—are mistaken for needs, it is not clear why people should use the product, and the offering is likely to suffer from having a poor, unconvincing value proposition. Additionally, there is too much focus on the solution (“solutionising”), which is likely to limit the development team’s ability to come up with the best possible design and architecture options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Confusion about what a need is; a lack of understanding of the user needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on the <em>why</em>: Ask why people would want to use the product. What specific benefit will it offer, or which problem will it help solve? Carry out qualitative market research like direct observation and problem interviews. Additionally, describe the needs from the users’ perspective, for example, “help me achieve a healthy target weight” or “help me significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/category/user-experience-ux/\">Five Tips for Building Empathy with Users</a>, <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-product/\">What is a Digital Product: Section “Features and Components”</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Needs Statement is not Specific</strong> Enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Get fit&#8221;, &#8220;Feel better&#8221;, &#8220;Improve eating habits”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: It’s perfectly fine to start out with a broad needs statement.

Iterate over the product vision board and refine its contents, similar to how you would refine the product backlog and break bigger items into more specific ones. For instance, if getting fit is the desired benefit, then a refined and more specific needs statement might be “be able to run 10k”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Information</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/\"><em>Strategize</em></a>, pp. 66.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>No Convincing Standout Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: “Easy-to-use user interface, calorie intake, barcode scanner”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Standout features ensure that your product is effectively differentiated: As their name suggests, they make your product stand out from the crowd, they give people a reason to choose it over competing offerings. If the features are weak, it will not be clear to prospective users why they should favour your product over alternatives, and it will be hard to market and sell the offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Lack of market insight, lack of empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: To address the first cause, perform competitor research and apply a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/make-your-product-stand-out-with-the-strategy-canvas/\">Strategy Canvas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/eliminate-features/\">E-R-R-C grid</a>.

I’m the author of a </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567\"><em>popular management book</em></a><em>. I used to lead design for the Facebook app. </em><strong><em>The Looking Glass</em></strong><em> is my once-a-month-ish musings on products, teams, and our journey as builders.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5_Xv5q_WfIXdhkIN.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Once upon a time, I received an important email in my inbox that alerted me to some distressing news.</p><p>Every six months, our company ran a wide-scale anonymous satisfaction survey that pretty much every single employee answered. If your team was big enough, you’d get your own breakout of the results for how your immediate team was feeling. I always looked forward to diving in and seeing what was going well and what wasn’t.</p><p>As my eyes scanned the various questions, graphs, and answers, one result in particular stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>Under the question “How often does your manager show care for you?” the chart that displayed the responses from my team was a mass of red. I had to read it a few times to ensure I wasn’t misunderstanding: <em>the majority of my team thought I didn’t show care for them?!</em></p><p>This was hard to process because of course I cared. I cared a lot! I took pride in helping my reports grow and thrive. I gave them challenging projects and frequent feedback because I wanted to see them succeed. And if there were ways in which I could help them — by hiring for their team, advocating for issues on their behalf, or pitching in on a tough project — I always showed up. How could they possibly think that I didn’t care?!</p><p>That night, I met a manager friend for dinner and poured my heart out to him. He listened and then gave me a diagnosis. “Julie,” he said, “Have you ever told your reports that you care about them? Or asked them how they’d like to be cared for?”</p><p>I searched my memories and came up short. He had a point. “Everyone’s wired differently,” he said. “So sometimes we struggle to understand each other. Maybe the way you show care and the way your reports perceive care are different. Everyone has their own preferences for how they like to operate and be treated.”</p><p>He was absolutely right. I took the feedback to better understand what “being cared for” meant to my reports. And I would learn this lesson time and time again — that even if you’re a good, experienced manager, even if you show up to work every day with confidence, you’re still going to fail to connect with others from time to time. You’ll still have misunderstandings or talk past each other.</p><p>Some of this will be due to cultural differences, or contrasting personalities, or because we simply have different perspectives and life experiences. Whatever the source, the more I understood about what mattered to my the people I worked with, the better of a colleague and manager I’d be. Similarly, the more my colleagues understood about how <em>I</em> worked, the fewer misunderstandings we’d have.</p><p>That’s where the exercise of creating a user manual comes in.</p><h4>A User Guide for You</h4><p>I started writing a “How to work with Julie” guide for my team about three or four years ago, and heard the phrase <em>User Guide</em> some time later. Instantly it stuck with me. When you buy a new camera, it comes with a little booklet that teaches you about the specifics of the gadget — what each button means, how to select the appropriate lighting, how to review the images.</p><p>A User Guide for a Person works in a similar way. It creates clarity on how you work — what you value, how you look at problems, what your blind spots or areas of growth are, and how to build trust with you.</p><p>It’s something you can give to your manager, the folks you work the closest with, or — if you are a manager — every new report who joins your team.</p><p>The key to a good User Guide is to make it as <em>specific to you as possible</em> (<a href=\"https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-candidates-companies\">check out this post on why that matters</a>). Leave out the generic fluff that everyone would agree with, like “<em>I get motivated when my work has impact.</em>” That doesn’t tell us anything, except that you’re not a cat. Can you be more specific and tell us what <em>kind</em> of impact is motivating to you (and what kind isn’t?)</p><p>The most effective User Guides contain snippets that might make you feel vulnerable, like you’re letting the team see you unplugged, in your PJs with rumpled hair. But vulnerability is the secret ingredient to trust. When you acknowledge your imperfections, you will receive far more rewards in the form of support, mentorship, and empathy. And you invite others to be more open with you as well.</p><p>I’ve included a User Guide template and my personal example as a starting point — feel free to modify to best suit your needs. Mine has been a living document over the years, honed through continual feedback that has shined new light on how I understand myself and my relationships. I hope yours gives you a similar gift.</p><p>Happy team-working!</p><h4><strong>Template: A User Guide To Working With &lt;Your Name&gt;</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://coda.io/@joulee/meet-julie\"><em>Use this template on Coda.io</em></a></p><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p><em>Why are you writing this user guide?

And I’m excited for all we’ll learn from each other! I already have high expectations that our collaboration together will yield some wonderful things :) That said, we are unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences and styles for how we like to work.</p><p>I’m writing this user guide to give you a better handle on me and my values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible. I encourage you to do the same and share your user guide with me as well!</p><h4><strong>How I view success</strong></h4><ul><li>A manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for her team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are people — hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; purpose — clarity on what success looks like; and process — clarity on how to best work. Of these three levers, I believe people is the most important.</li><li>Success is constantly learning and getting better. We can’t always control the results, and if we aim high we will sometimes fail. But no matter the outcome, there are always lessons to be mined. Those learnings are ours to keep forever.</li><li>The path to success matters as much as the outcome. Everyone gets lucky and unlucky sometimes. But if we’re good, our success will be sustainable because it’s our process that works.</li><li>It’s better to set ambitious goals that we don’t always meet, than to sell ourselves short.</li><li>We can always do and be better.</li><li>Success without integrity is like a car without an engine.</li></ul><h4><strong>How I communicate</strong></h4><ul><li>I am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk my thoughts out loud which can feel rambling. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or to be precise with action items.</li><li>Because a lot of my job is nurturing creativity, my preference is for others to come to the right solution with their own conviction, not to tell others what I think the right solution is. However, I recognize that sometimes the most pragmatic and efficient thing is to be clear with my opinion early on so we can resolve major misalignments. If I am not being clear and you worry we may not be seeing eye to eye, please let me know.</li><li>I like to be engaged in conversations and presentations and show respect to the speaker. I will often smile and nod along to encourage the speaker. It doesn’t mean I agree with everything that is being said.</li><li>I am continually working on being more direct, especially about concerns or things I don’t think are going well. I commit to giving you frequent feedback or suggestions that I think may help you. If it doesn’t feel like I am being direct enough, or if my feedback is not helpful, please let me know.</li><li>I place a lot of value on having a clear big-picture narrative and being able to to speak to the meaning behind the work, as well as what’s exciting about it. If you aren’t sure why we are working on something, please let me know.</li><li>I prefer email for asynchronous team communication. Please use email if you’re describing an issue with a good deal with context. I respond to most things within 2 work days, so if I’ve been slow, re-ping me as I do sometimes miss things. If something is urgent or easy to respond to, feel free to message me over chat, and allow me the rest of the day to respond.</li><li>If you feel something is better discussed with me in person, don’t hesitate to drop a note with what you’d like to talk about. If you are a direct report, I will try my best to move things around so we can meet as soon as possible — it’s extremely important to me that you feel you always have time when you need it. If you are not a direct report but I can be of help to you, then we’ll schedule time during the next available office hours block. Occasionally, I’ll lack the necessary context to be useful, and in those cases I will decline the meeting and suggest another person who would be better able to assist you.</li></ul><h4><strong>Things I do that may annoy you</strong></h4><ul><li>I am that archetype of the “high expectations Asian parent,” so I can seem demanding, critical, and never satisfied rather than supportive, encouraging, or empathetic. Since then, I’ve come to learn that different people respond better to different styles. Please know that I am always in your corner, and I care about you, even as I work on showing that better.</li><li>I am on the hyper-rational end of the emotional spectrum. This can be annoying when you share a problem or feeling with me, and I respond with a bunch of rationalized suggestions, when what the situation called for was listening and empathy. I am working on being better attuned to this.</li><li>I am generally more focused on inputs than outputs. This means that if there is a positive outcome, but the process in getting there didn’t seem sound or intentional to me, I might not see it as cause for celebration. This can be frustrating if you are more focused on outputs than inputs.</li><li>I am frequently late to meetings, like 1–5 minutes late. Sometimes there is a good reason, but 80% of the time, the reason is that I suck at punctuality, and need to get better at it. You should call me out when this happens.</li><li>I can fall into the bias of assuming everyone has the same context as I do, and as a result, not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly or as broadly as I should. Please remind me to provide more context if I do this.</li><li>Being a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics quickly, or who want to commit to plans and not change them.</li><li>Because I have a tendency to think long-term, I might give you impractical or complex suggestions when what you’re looking for is pragmatic, short-term options. Please remind me of the problem context if you feel my feedback is unhelpful or if you observe that I am trying to boil the ocean.</li><li>I’m optimistic and see the best in others, and sometimes that may strike you as naive or unrealistic when I’m convinced a tough situation can be fixed with greater effort versus a structural change.</li></ul><h4><strong>What gains and loses my trust</strong></h4><ul><li>The easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback — whether about a piece of design work, a project proposal, or their own behavior — and use it to improve. Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.</li><li>Another thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.</li><li>I appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.</li><li>I build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.</li><li>If you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.</li><li>If I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.</li><li>It’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.</li></ul><h4><strong>My strengths</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Strong relationships</strong>. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.</li><li><strong>Staying calm, collected, and optimistic</strong>. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong>. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.</li><li><strong>Thoughtful intentionality</strong>: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.</li></ul><h4><strong>My growth areas</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Directness and simplicity in communication</strong>: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.</li><li><strong>Execution/follow-through</strong>: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.</li><li><strong>Meta-prioritization</strong>: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.</li><li><strong>Expanding domains of knowledge</strong>: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.</li><li><strong>Storytelling</strong>: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.</li></ul><p><em>Image by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/miemo/\"><em>Miemo Penttinen</em></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b8ee547a79e9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","content:encodedSnippet":"What makes you tick?

Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.\nAnother thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal — including me! — to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.\nI appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (like me), who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.\nI build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.\nIf you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their back. If I observe you frequently saying things that you’d be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.\nIf I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well.\nIt’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.\n\nMy strengths\n\nStrong relationships. I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.\nStaying calm, collected, and optimistic. I don’t get overly emotional, and I do a good job of staying balanced. I like to look for the good in everyone and in every situation, and I believe we can make things great if we put our minds to it. This makes me effective at pitching projects, dealing with crises, and selling candidates.\nLong-term focus. I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I’d like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.\nThoughtful intentionality: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.\n\nMy growth areas\n\nDirectness and simplicity in communication: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I’d like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.\nExecution/follow-through: I have no shortage of new ideas but what I need to focus on instead is tighter execution, especially diligent and speedy follow-through.\nMeta-prioritization: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level — how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.\nExpanding domains of knowledge: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance — the list goes on and on.\nStorytelling: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.\n\nImage by Miemo Penttinen","dc:creator":"Julie Zhuo","guid":"https://medium.com/p/b8ee547a79e9","isoDate":"2020-08-07T14:30:36.000Z"},{"creator":"Julie Zhuo","title":"Seven Reminders about Racism","link":"https://joulee.medium.com/seven-reminders-about-racism-b1b3e20d018?source=rss-b8a4e5ae7490------2","pubDate":"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 14:30:43 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person.

We’ve been socialized to think of “those racists” as morally horrible, so we want to avoid being labelled <em>racist</em> at any cost. But this cost is astronomically high: we’ve been living under a veil of ignorance that whispers: <em>“Good” people (such as ourselves!) are not racists</em>. Therefore, we don’t talk about racism. We don’t talk about racism <em>so much</em> that it feels uncomfortable to bring up race up at all. But you can’t fix a problem if you don’t talk about it.</li><li>Doing something “racist” does not automatically mean that you are a morally horrible person. It means you’ve said or done things that perpetuate systems benefitting certain races — <em>your race</em> — at the expense of others. Instead of hearing <em>You said something racist</em> as <em>You just called me a shitty person</em>, we need to retrain ourselves to hear it as we would any other useful criticism — <em>Your statement had a negative impact on X person or group</em>. If you’re embarrassed about having that kind of negative impact, great! It means you care to do better (and are not a morally horrible person. )</li><li>The vast majority of conflicts are two-way streets, where each side can easily point out something the other side did that “wasn’t right.” For example, Person A calls Person B out for saying something racist, and Person B calls out Person A for saying it in an attacking manner. If you are Person C seeking to be a neutral mediator, you may think that both sides make reasonable points and could stand to improve by listening to the other. That seems fair, right? Well, only if Person B and Person A are in relatively equal positions of power. However, if they are not, <em>the person with greater power in the scenario holds greater responsibility to resolve (rather than escalate) the conflict.</em> If tensions escalate between a manager and her report, who would you expect to stay calm and collected? If a child and their parent both say “You’re awful” in a moment of anger to one another, who do you think needs to apologize first?</li><li>People with power often don’t recognize the power they have, especially if it’s afforded by the color of their skin. We tend to think of ourselves as “normal people,” “human, just like everyone else.” This is not wrong. None of us are exempt from joy, suffering, pain, fear, self-loathing, and the entire spectrum of the human condition. We all have moments when we feel trapped or suffocated by those who hold power over us. At the same time, <em>all</em> of us will be in contexts where we have more power than someone else. Some folks are in that position far more often due to the color of their skin (whiter), their gender (male), or their economic status (wealthier). Reflecting on your power is similar to the exercise of giving thanks: there is always something to be grateful for in your life (that somebody else doesn’t have); there is always something you have more power to change than somebody else.</li><li>Privilege is all the good stuff you get that others don’t because of the circumstances of your birth. Power is your ability to influence how the rules of our man-made society work. Both are hard to see in the same way that air is hard to see — you don’t notice it until there’s not enough. Black and Brown people have felt this lack for a long, long time. It started 400 years ago when they were enslaved, killed and treated as “less than” human. This lack continues today. Compared to a White or Asian person, it’s harder for them to be trusted, to be hired, to borrow money, to be believed, to be celebrated, to be in positions of power, or to be seen. We need to seek out, listen to and understand the stories of groups with less power and privilege to truly appreciate what we do have, and how we can apply that towards a more just society.</li><li>When someone calls you out for saying or doing something racist, your response can be very simple: 1) thank them for bringing it to your attention 2) apologize for the hurt you caused 3) commit to reflecting and improving. Thank them because feedback is a gift that will make your future self better. Apologize because you choose to believe people when they tell you they are hurt. Apologize even if your intentions were good, because good intentions don’t negate the negative impact of your actions. (You still say <em>Sorry</em> when you accidentally bump into someone, don’t you?) Reflect and strive for better because even if you don’t think you did anything wrong in that moment, you will likely find lessons to take away upon further processing. If you have feedback about how the other person’s message could have been better delivered, now’s not the time to share because it’s probably coming from a place of defensiveness. Save it for when you’ve built trust with that person and can share it with <em>their</em> best intentions in mind.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to acknowledge, talk about, and act on race and racism. You will make mistakes and say the wrong things. But that’s true for anything worthwhile in life. At the end of the day, actions matter. What can you do with your power?

In his article, he cites research from Google that suggests <strong>psychological safety is the most predictive characteristic of successful teams</strong>. As a minority working in tech, this article brought to mind a pressing question: given the lack of diversity in tech, how can tech workers foster a psychologically-safe environment for minorities, many of whom struggle just to be their true selves at work? For me, it starts with empathy.</p><p>Have you ever spent time in a place where you’re in the minority, even briefly? At an event, for example, or in another country? Think about how you felt being the only man at an event attended primarily by women, or the only white person in an entire train station in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. If you have never experienced this, try it. <strong>The feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, is what many minorities experience in the workplace on a regular basis.</strong></p><p>Until recently in my career, I was always the only black person on my team. Coworkers have generally been nice to me, but it’s hard to ignore that I’m <em>noticeably</em> different when no one else at work looks like I do. I’ve learned to ignore this feeling of being an outsider, but it always comes back eventually, whether it’s during meetings with executive leadership, while walking into a company’s office for an onsite interview, or in other work-related situations.</p><p>Perhaps you know some minorities who don’t seem to experience that feeling, and perhaps they don’t, especially when they feel successful in their career. I know minorities who’ve reached a point where they no longer give a damn about what others think or they’ve learned to cope with the status quo.</p><blockquote><em>But many minorities spend a significant amount of cognitive energy trying to belong instead of performing our best work and it’s exhausting.</em></blockquote><p>One thing I’ve come to realize is how hard it is for people to share these experiences. Often, these stories are too personal, emotional, subjective, or hard to share without deeply trusting the listener. It is also difficult to share these stories, as without the larger context, the listener is unlikely to grasp the nuances of the experience without knowing the backstory.</p><p>In general, many minorities choose not to speak up because they don’t want to jeopardize their careers, be disliked, feel like victims, or because their opinions have been ignored in the past. Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and ‘otherness’ that they experience, it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically, true to themselves, or thrive.</p><p>Although there has been more and more discussion about the lack of diversity in tech, I believe there is still a startling empathy gap as most people do not realize the sheer amount of energy minorities expend trying to belong.

In his article, he cites research from Google that suggests psychological safety is the most predictive characteristic of successful teams. As a minority working in tech, this article brought to mind a pressing question: given the lack of diversity in tech, how can tech workers foster a psychologically-safe environment for minorities, many of whom struggle just to be their true selves at work? For me, it starts with empathy.\nHave you ever spent time in a place where you’re in the minority, even briefly? At an event, for example, or in another country? Think about how you felt being the only man at an event attended primarily by women, or the only white person in an entire train station in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. If you have never experienced this, try it. The feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, is what many minorities experience in the workplace on a regular basis.\nUntil recently in my career, I was always the only black person on my team. Coworkers have generally been nice to me, but it’s hard to ignore that I’m noticeably different when no one else at work looks like I do. I’ve learned to ignore this feeling of being an outsider, but it always comes back eventually, whether it’s during meetings with executive leadership, while walking into a company’s office for an onsite interview, or in other work-related situations.\nPerhaps you know some minorities who don’t seem to experience that feeling, and perhaps they don’t, especially when they feel successful in their career. I know minorities who’ve reached a point where they no longer give a damn about what others think or they’ve learned to cope with the status quo.\nBut many minorities spend a significant amount of cognitive energy trying to belong instead of performing our best work and it’s exhausting.\nOne thing I’ve come to realize is how hard it is for people to share these experiences. Often, these stories are too personal, emotional, subjective, or hard to share without deeply trusting the listener. It is also difficult to share these stories, as without the larger context, the listener is unlikely to grasp the nuances of the experience without knowing the backstory.\nIn general, many minorities choose not to speak up because they don’t want to jeopardize their careers, be disliked, feel like victims, or because their opinions have been ignored in the past. Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and ‘otherness’ that they experience, it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically, true to themselves, or thrive.\nAlthough there has been more and more discussion about the lack of diversity in tech, I believe there is still a startling empathy gap as most people do not realize the sheer amount of energy minorities expend trying to belong. The ideal solution is simply to have companies that are diverse, so that no one feels out of place and everyone can thrive.\nAs a first step, our white, male-dominated industry needs to recognize the real struggle that underrepresented groups face and start driving conversations and actions to create a more empathetic and inclusive workplace. Without such empathy, most companies will continue to fail to achieve true organizational buy-in and won’t be able to take the necessary actions to attract, retain, or get the best work from people who come from underrepresented backgrounds. We can all contribute to finding solutions, but many people in tech don’t bother looking for those solutions because they fail to see the problem in the first place.\n(Thanks to Dan Sherizen and Leah Reich for reviewing earlier drafts)\n\nDiversity in Tech: The Unspoken Empathy Gap was originally published in Tech Diversity Files on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Jules Walter","guid":"https://medium.com/p/5b806c83d717","categories":["silicon-valley","diversity","tech"],"isoDate":"2016-06-06T16:25:38.000Z"},{"creator":"Jules Walter","title":"Teaching Coding Skills in Developing Countries","link":"https://medium.com/the-re-education/teaching-coding-skills-in-developing-countries-dc1df479257d?source=rss-eec997506378------2","pubDate":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 02:25:57 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>What I Learned Leading a Programming Bootcamp in Haiti</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WgkYM5R-BNe0mdV_7eskBQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Teacher (center) and students in the class</figcaption></figure><p>This spring I enrolled in a CodePath mobile development course.

One of the more challenging aspects of learning to code is the willingness to put in the hours it takes to attain proficiency.
