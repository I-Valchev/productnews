                         <p>There are still parts of Philadelphia’s SEPTA transportation system that accept tokens.

                         <p>In 2015,<strong> </strong>Brooklyn resident Shabazz Stuart regularly biked to his job at a local business improvement district. Then his bicycle was stolen—the third case of two-wheeled larceny he’d experienced in five years. The theft sent him back to mass transit while he saved up money to buy a replacement. It...</p>

                         <p>One evening last summer, my family was enjoying a picnic in the park near our house in London when two dogs attacked our blind 15-year-old Jack Russell terrier, Zoey.
