                         <p>Nathan McGee was only four years old when he experienced the trauma that would eventually lead him to MDMA therapy almost four decades later. It’s still too painful to go into the details.</p> <p>In the intervening years, he played what he calls “diagnosis bingo.” Doctors variously told Nathan he had...</p>

                         <p>When you and I look at the same object we assume that we’ll both see the same color. Whatever our identities or ideologies, we believe our realities meet at the most basic level of perception. But in 2015, a viral internet phenomenon tore this assumption asunder.
